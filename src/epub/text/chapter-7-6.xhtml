			<h2 epub:type="title">Harun al-Rashid and the Arab Girl</h2>

<p>The Caliph Harun al-Rashid was walking one day with Ja’afar
the Barmecide, when he espied a company of girls drawing water
and went up to them, having a mind to drink. As he drew near,
one of them turned to her fellows and improvised these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thy phantom bid thou fleet, and fly ✿ Far from the couch whereon I lie;</div>
      <div class="line">So I may rest and quench the fire, ✿ Bonfire in bones aye flaming high;</div>
      <div class="line">My love-sick form Love’s restless palm ✿ Rolls o’er the rug whereon I sigh:</div>
      <div class="line">How ’tis with me thou wottest well ✿ How long, then, union wilt deny?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Caliph marvelled at her elegance and eloquence.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Caliph, hearing the girl’s verses, marvelled at her elegance and
eloquence, and said to her, “O daughter of nobles, are these thine
own or a quotation?” Replied she, “They are my very own,” and
he rejoined, “An thou say sooth keep the sense and change the
rhyme.” So she said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Bid thou thy phantom distance keep ✿ And quit this couch the while I sleep;</div>
      <div class="line">So I may rest and quench the flames ✿ Through all my body rageful creep,</div>
      <div class="line">In love-sick one, whom passion’s palms ✿ Roll o’er the bed where grief I weep.</div>
      <div class="line">How ’tis with me thou wottest well; ✿ All but thy union hold I cheap!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Quoth the Caliph, “This also is stolen”; and quoth she, “Nay, ’tis
my very own.” He said, “If it be indeed thine own, change the
rhyme again and keep the sense.” So she recited the following:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Unto thy phantom deal behest ✿ To shun my couch the while I rest,</div>
      <div class="line">So I repose and quench the fire ✿ That burns what lieth in my breast,</div>
      <div class="line">My weary form Love’s restless palm ✿ Rolls o’er with boon of sleep unblest.</div>
      <div class="line">How ’tis with me thou wottest well ✿ When union’s bought ’tis haply best!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Quoth Al-Rashid, “This too is stolen”; and quoth she, “Not so,
’tis mine.” He said, “If thy words be true change the rhyme
once more.” And she recited:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Drive off the ghost that ever shows ✿ Beside my couch when I’d repose,</div>
      <div class="line">So I may rest and quench the fire ✿ Beneath my ribs e’er flames and glows,</div>
      <div class="line">In love-sick one, whom passion’s palms ✿ Roll o’er the couch where weeping flows,</div>
      <div class="line">How ’tis with me thou wottest well ✿ Will union come as union goes?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then said the Caliph, “Of what part of this camp art thou?”; and
she replied, “Of its middle in dwelling and of its highest in tent-poles.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3128" id="noteref-3128" epub:type="noteref">3128</a>
Wherefore he knew that she was the daughter of the
tribal chief. “And thou,” quoth she, “of what art thou among the
guardians of the horses?”; and quoth he, “Of the highest in tree
and of the ripest in fruit.” “Allah protect thee, O Commander
of the Faithful!” said she, and kissing ground called down
blessings on him. Then she went away with the maidens of
the Arabs, and the Caliph said to Ja’afar, “There is no help for
it but I take her to wife.” So Ja’afar repaired to her father and
said to him, “The Commander of the Faithful hath a mind to
thy daughter.” He replied, “With love and goodwill, she is a
gift as a handmaid to His Highness our Lord the Commander of
the Faithful.” So he equipped her and carried her to the Caliph,
who took her to wife and went in to her, and she became of the
dearest of his women to him. Furthermore, he bestowed on her
father largesse such as succoured him among Arabs, till he was
transported to the mercy of Almighty Allah. The Caliph, hearing
of his death, went in to her greatly troubled; and, when she saw
him looking afflicted, she entered her chamber and doffing all that
was upon her of rich raiment, donned mourning apparel and raised
lament for her father. It was said to her, “What is the reason of
this?”; and she replied, “My father is dead.” So they repaired
to the Caliph and told him and he rose and going in to her, asked
her who had informed her of her father’s death; and she answered
“It was thy face, O Commander of the Faithful!” Said he,
“How so?”; and she said, “Since I have been with thee, I never
saw thee on such wise till this time, and there was none for whom
I feared save my father, by reason of his great age; but may thy
head live, O Commander of the Faithful!” The Caliph’s eyes
filled with tears and he condoled with her; but she ceased not to
mourn for her father, till she followed him—Allah have mercy on
the twain! And a tale is also told of</p>
