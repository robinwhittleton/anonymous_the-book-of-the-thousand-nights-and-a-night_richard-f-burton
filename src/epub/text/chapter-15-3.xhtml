<p>It is related (but Allah is All-knowing) that there was in times of
yore a man named ’Abdullah al-Karkhí and he was wont to tell
the following tale:—One day I was present in the assembly of
Al-Hajjáj the son of Yúsuf the Thakafí<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7143" id="noteref-7143" epub:type="noteref">7143</a> what time he was
Governor of Kúfah, and the folk around him were seated and for
awe of him prostrated and these were the Emirs and Wazirs and
the Nabobs and the Chamberlains and the Lords of the Land and
the Headmen in command and amongst whom he showed like a
rending lion. And behold, there came to him a man young in
years and ragged of raiment and of case debased and there was
none of blossom upon his cheeks and the World had changed his
cuticle and Need had altered his complexion. Presently he
salam’d and deprecated and was eloquent in his salutation to the
Governor who returned his greeting and looking at him asked,
“Who art thou, O young man, and what hast thou to say and
what is thine excuse for pushing into the assembly of the Kings
even as if, O youth, thou hadst been an invited guest?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7144" id="noteref-7144" epub:type="noteref">7144</a> So say
me, who art thou and whose son art thou?” “I am the son of my
mother and my father,” answered he, and Al-Hajjaj continued,
“In what fashion hast thou come hither?”—“In my clothes.”
(¿) “Whence hast thou come?”—“From behind me.”
(¿) “Whither art thou intending?”—“Before me.” (¿) “On
what hast thou come?”—“On the ground.” (¿) “Whence art
thou, O young man?”—“I am from the city Misr.” (¿) “Art
thou from Cairo?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7145" id="noteref-7145" epub:type="noteref">7145</a>—“Why askest thou me, O Hajjaj?”
Whereupon the Lieutenant of Kufah replied, “Verily her ground
is gold and her Nile is rare to behold and her women are a toy
for the conqueror to enjoy, and her men are nor burghers nor
Badawis.” Quoth the youth, “I am not of them,” and quoth
Al-Hajjaj, “Then whence art thou, O young man?”—“I am
from the city of Syria.” (¿) “Then art thou from the stubbornest
of places and of the feeblest of races.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7146" id="noteref-7146" epub:type="noteref">7146</a> “Wherefore, O Hajjaj?”—“For
that it is a mixed breed I ween, nor Jew nor Nazarene.”
“I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young
man?”—“I am of Khorásán of ’Ajamí-land.” (¿) “Thou art
therefore from a place the fulsomest and of faith the infirmest.”—“Wherefore,
O Hajjaj?” (¿) “Because flocks and herds are
their chums and they are Ajams of the Ajams from whom liberal
deed never comes, and their morals and manners none to praise
presumes and their speech is gross and weighty, and stingy are
their rich and wealthy.” “I am not of them.” “Then whence
art thou, O young man?” “I am from Mosul.” (¿) “Then art
thou from the foulest and filthiest of a Catamite race, whose youth
is a scapegrace and whose old age hath wits as the wits of an
ass.” “I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young
man?” “I am from the land of Al-Yaman.” (¿) “Then art
thou from a clime other than delectable. And why so, O
Hajjaj?” (¿) “For that their noblest make womanly use of
Murd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7147" id="noteref-7147" epub:type="noteref">7147</a> or beardless boys and the meanest of them tan hides
and the lowest amongst them train baboons to dance, and others
are weavers of Burd or woollen plaids.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7148" id="noteref-7148" epub:type="noteref">7148</a> “I am not of them.”
(¿) “Then whence art thou, O young man?” “I am from Meccah.”
(¿) “Then art thou from a mine of captious carping and ignorance
and lack of wits and of sleep over-abundant, whereto Allah commissioned
a noble Prophet, and him they belied and they rejected:
so he went forth unto a folk which loved him and honoured him
and made him a conqueror despite the nose of the Meccan churls.”
“I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young
man? for verily thou hast been abundant of prate and my heart
longeth to cut off thy pate.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7149" id="noteref-7149" epub:type="noteref">7149</a> Hereupon quoth the youth, “An
I knew thou couldst slay me I had not worshipped any god save
thyself,” and quoth Al-Hajjaj, “Woe to thee, and who shall stay
me from slaying thee?” “To thyself be the woe with measure
enow,” cried the youth; “He shall hinder thee from killing me
who administereth between a man and his heart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7150" id="noteref-7150" epub:type="noteref">7150</a> and who falseth
not his promise.” “’Tis He,” rejoined Al-Hajjaj, “who directeth
me to thy death;” but the Youth retorted, “Allah forfend that
He appoint thee to my slaughter; nay rather art thou commissioned
by thy Devil, and I take refuge with the Lord from
Satan the stoned.” (¿) “Whence then art thou, O young man?”
“I am from Yathrib.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7151" id="noteref-7151" epub:type="noteref">7151</a> (¿) “And what be Yathrib?” “It is
Tayyibah.” (¿) “And what be Tayyibah?” “Al-Madinah, the
Luminate, the mine of inspiration and explanation and prohibition
and licitation,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7152" id="noteref-7152" epub:type="noteref">7152</a> and I am the seed of the Banú Ghálib<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7153" id="noteref-7153" epub:type="noteref">7153</a> and the
purest scion of the Imam ’Ali ibn Abí Talíb (Allah honour his
countenance and accept of him!), and all degree and descent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7154" id="noteref-7154" epub:type="noteref">7154</a>
must fail save my descent and degree which shall never be cut
off until the Day of Doom.” Hereupon Al-Hajjaj raged with
exceeding rage and ordered the Youth to execution; whereat rose
up against him the Lords of the realm and the headmen of the
reign and sued him by way of intercession and stretched out to
him their necks, saying, “Here are our heads before his head
and our lives before his life. By Allah, ho thou the Emir, there
is naught but that thou accept our impetration in the matter of
this Youth, for he is on no wise deserving of death.” Quoth
the Governor, “Weary not yourselves for needs must I slay him;
and even were an Angel from Heaven to cry out ’Kill him not,’
I would never hearken to his cry.” Quoth the youth, “Thou
shalt be baffled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7155" id="noteref-7155" epub:type="noteref">7155</a> O Hajjaj! Who art thou that an Angel from
Heaven should cry out to thee ’Kill him not,’ for thou art of the
vilest and meanest of mankind nor hast thou power to find a path
to my death.” Cried Al-Hajjaj, “By Allah, I will not slay thee
except upon a plea I will plead against thee, and convict thee by
thy very words.” “What is that, O Hajjaj?” asked the Youth, and
answered Hajjaj, “I will now question thee, and out of thine own
mouth will I convict thee and strike off thy head.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7156" id="noteref-7156" epub:type="noteref">7156</a> Now say me,
O young man:—Whereby doth the slave draw near to Allah
Almighty?” “By five things, prayer (1), and fasting (2), and
alms (3), and pilgrimage (4), and Holy War upon the path of
Almighty Allah (5).” “But I draw near to the Lord with the
blood of the men who declare that Hasan and Husayn were the
sons and successors of the Apostle of Allah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7157" id="noteref-7157" epub:type="noteref">7157</a> Furthermore, O
young man, how can they be born of the Apostle of Almighty
Allah when he sayeth, ’Never was Mohammed the father of any
man amongst you, but he was the Apostle of Allah and the Seal
of the Prophets,’”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7158" id="noteref-7158" epub:type="noteref">7158</a> “Hear thou, O Hajjaj, my answer with
another Koranic verse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7159" id="noteref-7159" epub:type="noteref">7159</a> ’What the Apostle hath given you, take:
and what he hath refused you, refuse.’ Now Allah Almighty
hath forbidden the taking of life, whose destruction is therefore
unlawful.” (¿) “Thou hast spoken sooth, O young man, but
inform me of what is incumbent on thee every day and every
night?” “The five canonical prayers,” (¿) “And for every
year?” “The fast of the month Ramazán.” (¿) “And for the
whole of thy life?” “One pilgrimage to the Holy House of
Allah.” (¿) “Sooth thou hast said, O young man; now do thou
inform me”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day, and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Five Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hajjaj said,
“Now do thou inform me who is the most excellent of the Arabs
and the noblest and of blood the purest?”—“The Khoraysh.”
(¿) “And wherefore so?” “For that the Prophets from them proceeded.”
(¿) “And what tribe is the knightliest of the Arabs and
the bravest and the firmest in fight?”—“The Banu Háshim.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7160" id="noteref-7160" epub:type="noteref">7160</a>
(¿) “And wherefore so?” “For that my grandsire the Imám Alí
ibn Abí Tálib is of them.” (¿) “And who is the most generous of
the Arabs and most steadfast in the guest-rite?”—“The Banu
Tayy.” (¿) “And wherefore so?” “For that Hátim of Tayy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7161" id="noteref-7161" epub:type="noteref">7161</a>
was one thereof.” (¿) “And who is the vilest of the Arabs and
the meanest and the most miserly, in whom weal is smallest and
ill is greatest?” “The Banu Thakíf.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7162" id="noteref-7162" epub:type="noteref">7162</a> (¿) “And wherefore
so?” “Because thou, O Hajjaj, art of them.” Thereupon the
Lieutenant of Kufah raged with exceeding rage and ordered the
slaughter of the youth; but the Grandees of the State rose up and
prayed him for mercy, when he accepted their intercession and
pardoned the offender. After which he said to him, “O young
man, concerning the kid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7163" id="noteref-7163" epub:type="noteref">7163</a> that is in the firmament, tell me be it
male or female?” for he was minded on this wise to cut short his
words. The young Sayyid replied, “O Hajjaj, draw me aside its
tail, so I may inform thee thereanent.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7164" id="noteref-7164" epub:type="noteref">7164</a> (¿) “O young man, say
me on what pasture best grow the horns of the camel?” “From
leaves of stone.” (¿) “O lack wit! do stones bear leaves.” “O
swollen of lips and little of wits and wisdom, say me do camels
have horns?” (¿) “Haply thou art a lover fond, O youth?”
“Yes! in love drowned.” (¿) “And whom lovest thou?”—“I
love my Lord, of whom I hope that he will turn my annoy into
joy, and who can save me this day from thee, O Hajjaj.” (¿) “And
dost thou know the Lord?” “Yes, I do.” (¿) “And whereby hast
thou known Him?” “By the Book of Him which descended upon
His Prophet-Apostle.” (¿) “And knowest thou the Koran by
heart?” “Doth the Koran fly from me that I should learn
it by rote?” (¿) “Hast thou confirmed knowledge thereof?”
“Verily Allah sent down a book confirmed.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7165" id="noteref-7165" epub:type="noteref">7165</a> (¿) “Hast thou
perused and mastered that which is therein?” “I have.” (¿)
“Then, O young man, if thou have read and learned what it containeth,
tell me which verset is the sublimest (1) and which verset
is the most imperious (2) and which verset is hopefullest (3) and
which verset is fearfullest (4) and which verset is believed by the
Jew and the Nazarene (5) and in which verset Allah speaketh
purely of Himself (6) and in which verset be the Angels mentioned
(7) and which verset alludeth to the Prophets (8) and in which verset
be mentioned the People of Paradise (9) and which verset speaketh
of the Folk of the Fire (10) and which verset containeth tenfold
signs (11) and which verset (12) speaketh of Iblís (whom Allah
accurse!).” Then quoth the youth, “Listen to my answering, O
Hajjaj, with the aid of the Beneficent King.” Now the sublimest
verset in the Book of Allah Almighty is the Throne verse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7166" id="noteref-7166" epub:type="noteref">7166</a> and
the most imperious is the word of Almighty Allah, ’Verily Allah
ordereth justice and well-doing and bestowal of gifts upon kith
and kin’;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7167" id="noteref-7167" epub:type="noteref">7167</a> and the justest is the word of the Almighty, ’Whoso
shall have wrought a mithkál (nay an atom) of good works shall
see it again, and whoso shall have wrought a mithkál (nay an atom)
of ill shall again see it’;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7168" id="noteref-7168" epub:type="noteref">7168</a> and the fullest of fear is that spoken by
the Almighty, ’Doth not every man of them desire that he enter
into the Paradise hight Al-Na’im?’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7169" id="noteref-7169" epub:type="noteref">7169</a> and the fullest of hope is the
word of the Almighty, ’Say Me, O My worshippers who have
sinned against your own souls, do not despair of Allah’s ruth’;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7170" id="noteref-7170" epub:type="noteref">7170</a>
and the verset which containeth ten signs is the word of the Lord
which saith<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7171" id="noteref-7171" epub:type="noteref">7171</a> ’Verily in the Creation of the Heavens and the Earth
and in the shifts of Night and Day and in the ships which pass
through the sea with what is useful to mankind; and in the rain
which Allah sendeth down from Heaven, thereby giving to the
earth life after death, and by scattering thereover all the moving
creatures, and in the change of the winds, and in the clouds which
are made to do service between the Heavens and the Earth are
signs for those who understand’; and the verset wherein believe
both Jews and Nazarenes is the word of Almighty Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7172" id="noteref-7172" epub:type="noteref">7172</a> ‘The
Jews say the Nazarenes are on naught, and the Christians say the
Jews are on naught, and both speak the sooth for they are on
naught.’ And the verset wherein Allah Almighty speaketh purely
of Himself is that word of Almighty Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7173" id="noteref-7173" epub:type="noteref">7173</a> ’And I created not
Jinn-kind and mankind save to the end that they adore Me’; and
the verset which was spoken of the Angels is the word of Almighty
Allah which saith,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7174" id="noteref-7174" epub:type="noteref">7174</a> ’Laud to Thee! we have no knowledge save
what Thou hast given us to know, and verily Thou art the Knowing,
the Wise.’ And the verset which speaketh of the Prophets is
the word of Almighty Allah that saith<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7175" id="noteref-7175" epub:type="noteref">7175</a> ’And We have already
sent Apostles before thee: of some We have told thee, and of
others we have told thee naught: yet no Apostle had the power to
come with a sign unless by the leave of Allah. But when Allah’s
behest cometh, everything shall be decided with truth; and then
perish they who entreated it as a vain thing’; and the verset which
speaketh of the Folk of the Fire is the word of Almighty Allah
which saith<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7176" id="noteref-7176" epub:type="noteref">7176</a> ’O our Lord! Bring us forth from her (the Fire),
and, if we return (to our sins), we shall indeed be of the evildoers’;
and the verset that speaketh of the People of Paradise is
the word of Almighty Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7177" id="noteref-7177" epub:type="noteref">7177</a> ’And they shall say: Laud to the
Lord who abated to us grief, and verily our lord is Gracious,
Grateful’; and the verset which speaketh of Iblis (whom Allah
Almighty accurse!), is the word of Almighty Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7178" id="noteref-7178" epub:type="noteref">7178</a> ’He said:
(I swear) therefore by Thy Glory, that all of them will I surely
lead astray.’ Hereupon Al-Hajjaj exclaimed, “Laud to the Lord
and thanksgiving Who giveth wisdom unto whoso He please!
Never indeed saw I a youth like this youth upon whom the
Almighty hath bestowed wits and wisdom and knowledge for all
the tenderness of his age. But say me, Who art thou, O young
man?” Quoth the youth, “I am of the folk of these things,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7179" id="noteref-7179" epub:type="noteref">7179</a> O
Hajjaj.” Resumed the Lieutenant, (¿) “Inform me concerning
the son of Adam what injureth him and what profiteth him?”
And the youth replied, “I will, O Hajjaj; do thou and these
present who are longing for permanency (and none is permanent
save Allah Almighty!) be early the fast to break, nor be over late
supper to make; and wear light body-clothes in summer and gar
heavy the headgear in winter, and guard the brain with what it
conserveth and the belly with what it preserveth and begin every
meal with salt for it driveth away seventy and two kinds of malady:
and whoso breaketh his fast each day with seven raisins red of hue”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night, and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——“With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
continued to Al-Hajjaj:—And whoso breaketh his fast daily
with seven raisins red of hue shall never find in his body aught that
irketh him; moreover, whoso each morning eateth on the spittle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7180" id="noteref-7180" epub:type="noteref">7180</a>
three ripe dates all the worms in his belly shall be slain and whoso
exceedeth in diet of boucan’d meat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7181" id="noteref-7181" epub:type="noteref">7181</a> and fish shall find his strength
weakened and his powers of carnal copulation abated; and beware
lest thou eat beef<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7182" id="noteref-7182" epub:type="noteref">7182</a> by cause that ’tis a disease forsure whereas
the soured milk of cows is a remedy secure and clarified butter is
a perfect cure: withal is its hide a succour for use and ure. And
do thou take to thee, O Hajjaj, the greater Salve.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7183" id="noteref-7183" epub:type="noteref">7183</a> Cried the
Lieutenant, “What may be that?” and said the youth in reply,
“A bittock of hard bread eaten<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7184" id="noteref-7184" epub:type="noteref">7184</a> upon the spittle, for indeed such
food consumeth the phlegm and similar humours which be at
the mouth of the maw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7185" id="noteref-7185" epub:type="noteref">7185</a> And let not blood in the hot bath for it
enfeebleth man’s force, and gaze not upon the metal pots of the
Balnea because such sight breedeth dimness of vision. Also have
no connection with woman in the Hammam for its consequence is
the palsy; nor do thou lie with her when thou art full or when
thou art empty or when thou art drunken with wine or when thou
art in wrath nor when lying on thy side, for that it occasioneth
swelling of the testicle-veins;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7186" id="noteref-7186" epub:type="noteref">7186</a> or when thou art under a fruit-bearing
tree. And avoid carnal knowledge of the old woman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7187" id="noteref-7187" epub:type="noteref">7187</a> for
that she taketh from thee and giveth not to thee. Moreover let
thy signet-ring be made of carnelian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7188" id="noteref-7188" epub:type="noteref">7188</a> because it is a guard against
poverty; also a look at the Holy Volume every morning increaseth
thy daily bread and to gaze at flowing water whetteth the sight
and to look upon the face of children is an act of adoration. And
when thou chancest lose thy way, crave aidance of Allah from
Satan the Stoned.” Hereupon quoth Al-Hajjaj, “Allah hath
been copious to thee, O young man for thou hast drowned me in
the depths of thy lore, but now inform me, Where is the seat of thy
dignified behaviour?”—“The two eyes.” (¿) “And where is the
seat of thy well-doing?”—“My tongue.” (¿) “And where is the
seat of thy intellect?”—“My brain.” (¿) “And where is the seat
of thy hearing?”—“The sensorium of mine ears.” (¿) “And
where is the seat of thy smelling?”—“The sensorium of my nose.”
(¿) “And where is the seat of thy taste?”—“My palate.” (¿) “And
where is the seat of thy gladness?”—“My heart.” (¿) “And
where is the seat of thy sorrow?”—“My soul.” (¿) “And where
is the seat of thy wrath?”—“My liver.” (¿) “And where is the
seat of thy laughing?”—“My spleen.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7189" id="noteref-7189" epub:type="noteref">7189</a> (¿) “And where is the
seat of thy bodily strength?”—“My two shoulders.” (¿) “And
where is that of thy weakness?”—“My two calves.” Hereupon
Al-Hajjaj exclaimed, “Laud to the Lord and thanksgiving; for
indeed, O young man, I see that thou knowest everything. So
tell me somewhat concerning husbandry?”—“The best of corn is
the thickest of cob and the grossest of grain and the fullest sized
of shock.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7190" id="noteref-7190" epub:type="noteref">7190</a> (¿) “And what sayest thou concerning palm-trees?”—“The
most excellent is that which the greatest of gathering doth
own and whose height is low-grown and within whose meat is the
smallest stone.” (¿) “And what dost thou say anent the vine?”—“The
most noble is that which is stout of stem and big of
bunch.” (¿) “And what sayest thou concerning the Heavens?”—“This
is the furthest extent of man’s sight and the dwelling-place
of the Sun and Moon and all the Stars that give light, raised on
high without columns pight and overshadowing the numbers that
stand beneath its height.” (¿) “And what dost thou say concerning
the Earth?”—“It is wide dispread in length and breadth.”
(¿) “And what dost thou say anent the rain?”—“The most
excellent is that which filleth the pits and pools and which
overfloweth into the wadys and the rivers.” Hereupon quoth
Al-Hajjaj, “O young man inform me what women be the best”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hajjaj said
“O young man, inform me what women be the best and the
most enjoyable.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7191" id="noteref-7191" epub:type="noteref">7191</a>—“One in winning ways excelling and in
comeliness exceeding and in speech killing: one whose brow
glanceth marvellous bright to whoso filleth his eyes with her sight
and to whom she bequeatheth sorrow and blight; one whose
breasts are small whilst her hips are large and her cheeks are rosy
red and her eyes are deeply black and her lips are full-formed;
one who if she look upon the heavens even the rocks will be robed
in green, and if she look upon the earth her lips<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7192" id="noteref-7192" epub:type="noteref">7192</a> unpierced pearls
shall rain; one the dews of whose mouth are the sweetest of
waters; one who in beauty hath no peer nor is there any loveliness
can with hers compare: the coolth of the eyes to great and
small; in fine, one whose praises certain of the poets have sung
in these harmonious couplets:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7193" id="noteref-7193" epub:type="noteref">7193</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“A fair one to idolaters if she herself should show, They’d leave their idols and her face for only Lord would know.</div>
      <div class="line">If in the Eastward she appeared unto a monk, for once He’d cease from turning to the West and to the East bend low;</div>
      <div class="line">And into the briny sea one day she chanced to spit, Assuredly the salt sea’s floods straight fresh and sweet would grow.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereupon quoth Al-Hajjaj, “Thou hast said well and hast spoken
fair, O young man; and now what canst thou declare concerning
a maiden of ten years told?” Quoth the youth, “She is a joy to
behold.” (¿) “And a damsel of twenty years old?”—“A coolth to
eyes manifold.” (¿) “And a woman thirty of age?”—“One who the
hearts of enjoyers can engage.” (¿) “And in her fortieth year?”—“Fat,
fresh and fair doth she appear.” (¿) “And of the half
century?”—“The mother of men and maids in plenty.” (¿) “And
a crone of three score?”—“Men ask of her never more.” (¿)
“And when three score and ten?”—“An old trot and remnant
of men.” (¿) “And one who reacheth four score?” “Unfit for
the world and for the faith forlore.” (¿) “And one of ninety?”—“Ask
not of whoso in Jahím be”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7194" id="noteref-7194" epub:type="noteref">7194</a> (¿) “And a woman who to
an hundred hath owned?”—“I take refuge with Allah from Satan
the Stoned.” Then Al-Hajjaj laughed aloud and said, “O young
man, I desire of thee even as thou describedst womankind in
prose so thou show me their conditions in verse;” and the Sayyid,
having answered, “Hearkening and obedience, O Hajjaj,” fell to
improvising these couplets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7195" id="noteref-7195" epub:type="noteref">7195</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“When a maid owns to ten her new breasts arise ✿ And like diver’s pearl with fair neck she hies:</div>
      <div class="line">The damsel of twenty defies compare ✿ ’Tis she whose disport we desire and prize:</div>
      <div class="line">She of thirty hath healing on cheeks of her; ✿ She’s a pleasure, a plant whose sap never dries:</div>
      <div class="line">If on her in the forties thou happily hap ✿ She’s best of her sex, hail to him with her lies!</div>
      <div class="line">She of fifty (pray Allah be copious to her!) ✿ With wit, craft and wisdom her children supplies.</div>
      <div class="line">The dame of sixty hath lost some force ✿ Whose remnants are easy to ravenous eyes:</div>
      <div class="line">At three score ten few shall seek her house ✿ Age-threadbare made till afresh she rise:</div>
      <div class="line">The fourscore dame hath a bunchy back ✿ From mischievous eld whom perforce Love flies:</div>
      <div class="line">And the crone of ninety hath palsied head ✿ And lies wakeful o’nights and in watchful guise;</div>
      <div class="line">And with ten years added would Heaven she bide ✿ Shrouded in sea with a shark for guide!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereupon Al-Hajjaj laughed aloud and all who were with him in
assembly; and presently he resumed, “O youth, tell me concerning
the first man who spake in verse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7196" id="noteref-7196" epub:type="noteref">7196</a> and that was our
common sire, Adam (The Peace be upon him!) what time Kábíl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7197" id="noteref-7197" epub:type="noteref">7197</a>
slew Hábíl his brother when our forefather improvised these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Changed I see my country and all thereon; ✿ Earth is now a blackavice, ugly grown:</div>
      <div class="line">The hue and flavour of food is fled ✿ And cheer is fainting from fair face flown.</div>
      <div class="line">An thou, O Abel, be slain this day ✿ Thy death I bemourn with heart tornand lone.</div>
      <div class="line">Weep these eyes and ’sooth they have right to weep ✿ Their tears are as rills flowing hills adown.</div>
      <div class="line">Kábil slew Hábil—did his brother dead; ✿ Oh my woe for that lovely face, ochone!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7198" id="noteref-7198" epub:type="noteref">7198</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereat Al-Hajjaj asked, “O, young man, what drove our ancestor
to poetry?” whereto answered the youth——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Five Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
replied, “He was driven to poetry by Iblis (whom Allah accurse!)
when he spake in this verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou bewailest the land and all thereon ✿ And scant was the breadth of Eden didst own,</div>
      <div class="line">Where thou wast girded by every good ✿ O’ life and in rest ever won’t to wone:</div>
      <div class="line">But ne’er ceased my wiles and my guile until ✿ The wind o’erthrew thee by folly blown.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7199" id="noteref-7199" epub:type="noteref">7199</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Whereupon quoth Al-Hajjaj, “O young man, inform me concerning
the first couplet of verse spoken by the Arab in praise of
munificence;” and quoth the youth, “O Hajjaj, the first Arabic
distich known to me was spoken by Hátim of Tayy, and ’twas as
follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And the guest I greet ere from me he go ✿ Before wife and weans in my weal and woe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then cried Al-Hajjaj, “Thou hast said well and hast spoken fair,
O young man; and thy due is incumbent upon us for that thou hast
drowned us in the deeps of thy wisdom.” Presently the Lieutenant
of Kufah turning towards one of his eunuchs said, “Bring me at
this very moment a purse containing ten thousand dirhams<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7200" id="noteref-7200" epub:type="noteref">7200</a> upon
a charger of red gold and a suit of the rarest of my raiment and a
blood mare the noblest steed of my steeds with a saddle of
gold and a haubergeon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7201" id="noteref-7201" epub:type="noteref">7201</a> and a lance of full length and a handmaid
the handsomest of my slave-girls.” The attendant disappeared
for a while, and presently brought all this between the
hands of Al-Hajjaj, who said, “O young man, this damsel is the
fairest of my chattels, and this be the purse on a charger of gold,
and this mare is the purest in blood of my steeds together with her
housings, so do thou take whatever thou desirest thereof, either the
mare with all upon her or the purse of gold or the concubine,”
presently saying to himself, “If the young man prefer the purse,
’twill prove that he loveth the world and I will slay him, also if he
choose the girl, he lusteth after womankind, and I will do him die:
but if he take the mare and her furniture, he will show himself the
brave of braves, and he meriteth not destruction at my hands.”
Then the youth came forward and took the mare and her appointments.
Now the damsel was standing by the young Sayyid, and
she winked at him with her eye as one saying, “Do thou choose
me and leave all the rest;” whereupon he began to improvise the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The jingling bridle on Bayard’s neck. ✿ Is dearer to me than what sign thou deign:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear when I fall into straits and fare ✿ Abroad, no comrade in thee to gain:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear when lain on my couch and long ✿ My sickness, thou prove thee nor fond nor fain:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear me that time groweth scant my good ✿ And my hand be strait thou shalt work me bane:</div>
      <div class="line">A helpmate I want shall do what do I ✿ And bear patient the pasture of barren plain.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7202" id="noteref-7202" epub:type="noteref">7202</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Presently the handmaid answered his verse with the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Forfend me, Allah, from all thou say’st ✿ Though my left with my right thou shalt hew in twain</div>
      <div class="line">A husband’s honour my works shall keep ✿ And I’ll wone content with his smallest gain:</div>
      <div class="line">Didst know me well and my nature weet ✿ Thou hadst found me mate of the meekest strain.</div>
      <div class="line">Nor all of women are like to sight ✿ Nor all of men are of similar grain.</div>
      <div class="line">The charge of a mate to the good belongs ✿ Let this oath by Allah belief obtain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hearing these words Al-Hajjaj exclaimed, “Woe to thee,
O damsel, dost thou answer him in his verse? and do thou
O young man, take the whole, and may Allah give thee no
blessing therein.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7203" id="noteref-7203" epub:type="noteref">7203</a> Answered the young Sayyid, “Here with
them, O Hajjaj, inasmuch as thou hast given them to me, I will
not oppose the order of Allah through thee, but another time
there is no union between us twain, me and thee, as there hath
been this day.” Now the city of Al-Hajjaj had two gates—the
door of Destruction and the door of Salvation; and when the
youth asked him, “O Hajjaj, shall I go forth from this or from
that?” the Lieutenant of Kufah cried, “Issue by this outlet,”
and showed him the Gate of Safety. Then the youth took all
the presents and fared forth by the passage which had been shown
to him, and went his ways and was seen no more. Hereupon the
Grandees of the kingdom said to Al-Hajjaj, “O our lord, how
hast thou given to him these gifts and he hath on nowise thanked
thee, nor wished thee well<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7204" id="noteref-7204" epub:type="noteref">7204</a> for thy favours, and yet hast thou
pointed out to him the Gate of Salvation?” Hereupon he replied,
“Verily, the youth asked direction of me, and it becometh the
director to be trustworthy and no traitor (Allah’s curse be upon
him who betrayeth!), and this youth meriteth naught save mercy
by reason of his learning.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7205" id="noteref-7205" epub:type="noteref">7205</a></p>
