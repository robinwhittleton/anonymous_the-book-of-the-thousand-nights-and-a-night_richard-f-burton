			<h2 epub:type="title">Nur al-Din Ali of Damascus and the Damsel Sitt al-Miláh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5907" id="noteref-5907" epub:type="noteref">5907</a></h2>

<p>There was once, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone
before, a merchant of the merchants of Damascus, by name Abu
al-Hasan, who had money and means, slave-blacks and slave-girls,
lands and gardens, houses and Hammams in that city; but he was
not blessed with boon of child and indeed his age waxed great.
So he addressed himself to supplicate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5908" id="noteref-5908" epub:type="noteref">5908</a> Allah Almighty in private
and in public and in his bows and his prostrations and at the
season of prayer-call, beseeching Him to vouchsafe him, before
his decease, a son who should inherit his wealth and possessions.
The Lord answered his prayer; his wife conceived and the days
of her pregnancy were accomplished and her months and her
nights; and the travail-pangs came upon her and she gave birth
to a boy, as he were a slice of Luna. He had not his match
for beauty and he put to shame the sun and the resplendent
moon; for he had a beaming face and black eyes of Bábilí
witchery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5909" id="noteref-5909" epub:type="noteref">5909</a> and aquiline nose and carnelian lips; in fine, he was
perfect of attributes, the loveliest of folk of his time, sans
dubitation or gainsaying. His father joyed in him with exceeding
joy and his heart was solaced and he was at last happy: he
made banquets to the folk and he clad the poor and the widows.
Presently he named the boy Sídí Nur al-Din Ali and reared him
in fondness and delight among the hand-maids and thralls. When
he had passed his seventh year, his father put him to school,
where he learned the sublime Koran and the arts of writing and
reckoning; and when he reached his tenth year, he was taught
horsemanship and archery and to occupy himself with arts and
sciences of all kinds, part and parts.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5910" id="noteref-5910" epub:type="noteref">5910</a> He grew up pleasant
and polite, winsome and lovesome; a ravishment to all who
saw him, and he inclined to companying with brethren and
comrades and mixing with merchants and travelled men. From
these he heard tell of that which they had witnessed of the
wonders of the cities in their wayfare and heard them say,
“Whoso journeyeth not enjoyeth naught;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5911" id="noteref-5911" epub:type="noteref">5911</a> especially of the
city of Baghdad.” So he was concerned with exceeding concern
for his lack of travel and disclosed this to his sire, who said
to him, “O my son, why do I see thee chagrined?” Quoth
he, “I would fain travel;” and quoth Abu al-Hasan, “O my
son, none travelleth save those whose need is urgent and those
who are compelled thereto by want. As for thee, O my son, thou
enjoyest ample means; so do thou content thyself with that
which Allah hath given thee and be bounteous to others, even
as He hath been bountiful to thee; and afflict not thyself with
the toil and tribulation of travel, for indeed it is said that travel
is a piece of Hell-torment.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5912" id="noteref-5912" epub:type="noteref">5912</a> But the youth said, “Needs must
I journey to Baghdad, the House of Peace.” When his father
saw the strength of his resolve to travel, he fell in with his
wishes and fitted him out with five thousand dinars in cash and
the like in merchandise and sent with him two serving-men.
So the youth fared forth, on the blessing of Allah Almighty;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5913" id="noteref-5913" epub:type="noteref">5913</a>
and his parent went out with him, to take leave of him, and
returned to Damascus. As for Nur al-Din Ali, he ceased not
travelling days and nights till he entered Baghdad city, and
laying up his loads in the Wakálah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5914" id="noteref-5914" epub:type="noteref">5914</a>, made for the Hammam-bath,
where he did away that which was upon him of the soil
of the road and doffing his travelling clothes, donned a costly
suit of Yamaní stuff, worth an hundred dinars. Then he loaded
his sleeve with a thousand miskals of gold and sallied forth
a-walking and swaying gracefully as he paced along. His gait
confounded all those who gazed upon him, as he shamed the
branches with his shape and belittled the rose with the redness
of his cheeks and his black eyes of Babilí witchcraft: thou wouldst
deem that whoso looked on him would surely be preserved from
bane and bale;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5915" id="noteref-5915" epub:type="noteref">5915</a> for he was even as saith of him one of his
describers in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thy haters and enviers say for jeer ✿ A true say that profits what ears will hear;</div>
      <div class="line">“No boast is his whom the gear adorns; ✿ The boast be his who adorns the gear!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">So Sidi Nur al-Din went walking in the highways of the city
and viewing its edifices and its bazars and thoroughfares and
gazing on its folk. Presently, Abú Nowás met him. (Now he
was of those of whom it is said, “They love fair lads,” and indeed
there is said what is said concerning him).<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5916" id="noteref-5916" epub:type="noteref">5916</a> When he saw
Nur al-Din Ali, he stared at him in amazement and exclaimed,
“Say, I take refuge with the Lord of the Daybreak!” Then he
accosted the youth and saluting him, asked him, “Why do I see
my lord lone and lorn? Meseemeth thou art a stranger and
knowest not this country; so, with leave of my lord, I will put
myself at his service and acquaint him with the streets, for
that I know this city.” Nur al-Din answered, “This will be
of thy favour, O nuncle.” Abu Nowas rejoiced at this and fared
on with him, showing him the streets and bazars, till they came
to the house of a slave-dealer, where he stopped and said to the
youth, “From what city art thou?” “From Damascus,” replied
Nur al-Din; and Abu Nowas said, “By Allah, thou art from a
blessed city, even as saith of it the poet in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Now is Damascus a garth adorned ✿ For her seekers, the Houris and Paradise-boys.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Sidi Nur al-Din thanked him and the twain entered the mansion
of the slave-merchant. When the people of the house saw Abu
Nowas, they rose to do him reverence, for that which they knew
of his rank with the Commander of the Faithful; and the slave-dealer
himself came up to them with two chairs whereon they
seated themselves. Then the slave-merchant went inside and
returning with a slave-girl, as she were a branch of Ban or a
rattan-cane, clad in a vest of damask silk and tired with a black
and white headdress whose ends fell down over her face, seated
her on a chair of ebony; after which he cried to those who were
present, “I will discover to you a favour as it were a full moon
breaking forth from under a cloud-bank.” They replied, “Do
so;” whereupon he unveiled the damsel’s face and behold, she
was like the shining sun, with shapely shape and dawn-bright
cheeks and thready waist and heavy hips; brief, she was endowed
with an elegance, whose description is unfound, and was even as
saith of her the poet:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5917" id="noteref-5917" epub:type="noteref">5917</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A fair one, to idolaters if she herself should show,  They’d leave their idols and her face for only Lord would know;</div>
      <div class="line">And if into the briny sea one day she chanced to spit, Assuredly the salt sea’s floods straight fresh and sweet would grow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">The dealer stood at the hand-maid’s head and one of the merchants
said, “I bid a thousand dinars for her.” Quoth another, “I bid
one thousand one hundred dinars;” and a third, “I bid twelve
hundred.” Then said a fourth merchant, “Be she mine for
fourteen hundred ducats.” And the biddings standing still at
that sum, her owner said, “I will not sell her save with her
consent: an if she desire to be sold, I will sell her to whom she
willeth.” The slave-dealer asked him, “What is her name?”
Answered the other, “Her name is Sitt al-Miláh;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5918" id="noteref-5918" epub:type="noteref">5918</a> whereupon
the dealer said to her, “With thy leave, I will sell thee to yonder
merchant for this price of fourteen hundred dinars.” Quoth she,
“Come hither to me.” So the man-vendor came up to her
and when he drew near, she gave him a kick with her foot
and cast him to the ground, saying, “I will not have that oldster.”
The slave-dealer arose, shaking the dust from his dress
and head, and cried, “Who biddeth more of us? Who is
desirous?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5919" id="noteref-5919" epub:type="noteref">5919</a> Said one of the merchants, “I,” and the dealer
said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah, shall I sell thee to this merchant?”
She replied, “Come hither to me;” but he rejoined, “Nay; speak
and I will hear thee from my place, for I will not trust myself
to thee nor hold myself safe when near thee.” So she cried,
“Indeed I will not have him.” Then the slave-dealer looked at
her and seeing her fix eyes on the young Damascene, for that
in very deed he had fascinated her with his beauty and loveliness,
went up to him and said to him, “O my lord, art thou a looker-on
or a buyer? Tell me.” Quoth Nur al-Din, “I am both looker-on
and buyer. Wilt thou sell me yonder slave-girl for sixteen
hundred ducats?” And he pulled out the purse of gold. Hereupon
the dealer returned, dancing and clapping his hands and
saying, “So be it, so be it, or not at all!” Then he came to
the damsel and said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah, shall I sell thee
to yonder young Damascene for sixteen hundred dinars?” But
she answered, “No,” of bashfulness before her master and the bystanders;
whereupon the people of the bazar and the slave-merchant
departed, and Abu Nowas and Ali Nur al-Din arose
and went each his own way, whilst the damsel returned to her
owner’s house, full of love for the young Damascene. When the
night darkened on her, she called him to mind and her heart
hung to him and sleep visited her not; and on this wise she
abode days and nights, till she sickened and abstained from
food. So her lord went in to her and asked her, “O Sitt al-Milah,
how findest thou thyself?” Answered she, “O my lord, dead
without chance of deliverance and I beseech thee to bring me my
shroud, so I may look upon it ere I die.” Therewith he went out
from her, sore concerned for her, and betaking himself to the
bazar, found a friend of his, a draper, who had been present on
the day when the damsel was cried for sale. Quoth his friend to
him, “Why do I see thee troubled?” and quoth he, “Sitt al-Milah
is at the point of death and for three days she hath neither eaten
nor drunken. I questioned her to-day of her case and she said:—O
my lord, buy me a shroud so I may look upon it ere I die.”
The draper replied, “Methinks naught aileth her but that she is
in love with the young Damascene, and I counsel thee to mention
his name to her and declare to her that he hath foregathered
with thee on her account and is desirous of coming to thy quarters,
so he may hear somewhat of her singing. An she say:—I reck
not of him, for there is that to do with me which distracteth me
from the Damascene and from other than he, know that she
saith sooth concerning her sickness; but, an she say thee other
than this, acquaint me therewith.” So the man returned to his
lodging and going in to his slave-girl said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah,
I went out for thy need and there met me the young man of
Damascus, and he saluted me with the salam and saluteth thee;
he seeketh to win thy favour and prayed me to admit him as a
guest in our dwelling, so thou mayst let him hear somewhat of
thy singing.” When she heard speak of the young Damascene,
she gave a sob, that her soul was like to leave her body, and
answered, “He knoweth my plight and how these three days past
I have not eaten nor drunken, and I beseech thee, O my lord,
by Allah of All-Might, to do thy duty by the stranger and bring
him to my lodging and make excuse to him for me.” When her
master heard this, his reason fled for joy, and he went to his
familiar the draper and said to him, “Thou wast right in the
matter of the damsel, for that she is in love with the young
Damascene; so how shall I manage?” Said the other, “Go to
the bazar and when thou seest him, salute him, and say to him:—Thy
departure the other day, without winning thy wish, was
grievous to me; so, an thou be still minded to buy the maid,
I will abate thee of that which thou badest for her an hundred
sequins by way of gaining thy favour; seeing thou be a stranger in
our land. If he say to thee:—I have no desire for her and hold
off from thee, be assured that he will not buy; in which case, let
me know, so I may devise thee another device; and if he say to
thee other than this, conceal not from me aught.” So the girl’s
owner betook himself to the bazar, where he found the youth
seated at the upper end of the place where the merchants mostly
do meet, selling and buying and taking and giving, as he were the
moon on the night of its full, and saluted him. The young man
returned his salam and he said to him, “O my lord, be not
offended at the damsel’s speech the other day, for her price shall
be lowered to the intent that I may secure thy favour. An thou
desire her for naught, I will send her to thee or an thou
wouldst have me abate to thee her price, I will well, for I desire
nothing save what shall content thee; seeing thou art a stranger
in our land and it behoveth us to treat thee hospitably and have
consideration for thee.” The youth replied, “By Allah, I will
not take her from thee but at an advance on that which I bade thee
for her afore; so wilt thou now sell her to me for one thousand
and seven hundred dinars?” And the other rejoined, “O my
lord, I sell her to thee, may Allah bless thee in her!” Thereupon
the young man went to his quarters and fetching a purse, sent for
the girl’s owner and weighed out to him the price aforesaid,
whilst the draper was between the twain. Then said he, “Bring
her forth;” but the other replied, “She cannot come forth at this
present; but be thou my guest the rest of this day and night, and
on the morrow thou shalt take thy slave-girl and go in the ward
of Allah.” The youth agreed with him on this and he carried
him to his house, where, after a little, he bade meat and wine
be brought, and they ate and drank. Then said Nur al-Din to
the girl’s owner, “I would have thee bring me the damsel, because
I bought her not but for the like of this time.” So he arose and
going in to the girl, said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah, the young man
hath paid down thy price and we have bidden him hither; so he
hath come to our quarters and we have entertained him, and he
would fain have thee be present with him.” Therewith the damsel
rose deftly and doffing her dress, bathed and donned sumptuous
apparel and perfumed herself and went out to him, as she were a
branch of Ban or a cane of rattan, followed by a black slave-girl,
bearing the lute. When she came to the young man, she saluted
him and sat down by his side. Then she took the lute from
the slave-girl and screwing up its pegs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5920" id="noteref-5920" epub:type="noteref">5920</a> smote thereon in four-and-twenty
modes, after which she returned to the first and sang
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My joy in this world is to see and sit near thee, ✿ Thy love’s my religion; thy Union my pleasure.</div>
      <div class="line">Attest it these tears when in memory I speer thee, ✿ And unchecked down my cheeks pours the flood without measure.</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, no rival in love hast to fear thee; ✿ I’m thy slave as I sware, and this troth is my treasure.</div>
      <div class="line">Be not this our last meeting: by Allah I swear thee ✿ Thy severance to me were most bitter displeasure!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">The young man was moved to delight and cried, “By Allah,
thou sayest well, O Sitt al-Milah! Let me hear more.” Then
he largessed her with fifty gold pieces and they drank and the
cups made circuit among them; and her seller said to her,
“O Sitt al-Milah, this is the season of farewelling; so let us
hear somewhat thereon.” Accordingly she struck the lute and
touching upon that which was in her heart, improvised these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I thole longing, remembrance and sad repine, ✿ Nor my heart can brook woes in so lengthened line.</div>
      <div class="line">O my lords think not I forget your love; ✿ My case is sure case and cure shows no sign.</div>
      <div class="line">If creature could swim in the flood of his tears, ✿ I were first to swim in these floods of brine:</div>
      <div class="line">O Cup-boy withhold cup and bowl from a wretch ✿ Who ne’er ceaseth to drink of her tears for wine!</div>
      <div class="line">Had I known that parting would do me die, ✿ I had shirked to part, but—’twas Fate’s design.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Now whilst they were thus enjoying whatso is most delicious of
ease and delight, and indeed the wine was to them sweet and
the talk a treat, behold, there came a knocking at the door. So
the house-master went out, that he might see what might be the
matter, and found ten head of the Caliph’s eunuchs at the entrance.
When he saw this, he was startled and said,  “What is to do?”
“The Commander of the Faithful saluteth thee and requireth of
thee the slave-girl whom thou hast exposed for sale and whose
name is Sitt al-Milah.”  “By Allah, I have sold her.”  “Swear by
the head of the Commander of the Faithful that she is not in thy
quarters.” The slaver made oath that he had sold her and that
she was no longer at his disposal: yet they paid no heed to his
word and forcing their way into the house, found the damsel and
the young Damascene in the sitting-chamber. So they laid hands
upon her, and the youth said,  “This is my slave-girl, whom I have
bought with my money;”  but they hearkened not to his speech
and taking her, carried her off to the Prince of True Believers.
Therewith Nur al-Din’s pleasure was troubled: he arose and
donned his dress, and his host said,  “Whither away this night, O
my lord?” Said he,  “I purpose going to my quarters, and to-morrow
I will betake myself to the palace of the Commander of
the Faithful and demand my slave-girl.” The other replied,  “Sleep
till the morning, and fare not forth at the like of this hour.” But
he rejoined, “Needs must I go;”  and the host said to him,  “Go
in Allah his safeguard.” So the youth went forth and, drunkenness
having got the mastery of his wits, he threw himself down on a bench
before one of the shops. Now the watchmen were at that hour
making their rounds and they smelt the sweet scent of essences
and wine that reeked from him; so they made for it and suddenly
beheld the youth lying on the bench, without sign of recovering.
They poured water upon him, and he awoke, whereupon they
carried him to the office of the Chief of Police and he questioned
him of his case. He replied,  “O my lord, I am an alien in this
town and have been with one of my friends: I came forth from
his house and drunkenness overcame me.” The Wali bade carry
him to his lodging; but one of those in attendance upon him,
Al-Murádi hight, said to him,  “What wilt thou do? This man
is robed in rich raiment and on his finger is a golden ring, whose
bezel is a ruby of great price; so we will carry him away and slay
him and take that which is upon him of clothes and bring to thee
all we get; for that thou wilt not often see profit the like thereof,
especially as this fellow is a foreigner and there is none to ask after
him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5921" id="noteref-5921" epub:type="noteref">5921</a> Quoth the Chief, “This wight is a thief and that which he
saith is leasing.” Nur al-Din said, “Allah forfend that I should be
a thief!” but the Wali answered, “Thou liest.” So they stripped
him of his clothes and taking the seal-ring from his finger, beat
him with a grievous beating, what while he cried out for succour,
but none succoured him, and besought protection, but none
protected him. Then said he to them, “O folk, ye are quit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5922" id="noteref-5922" epub:type="noteref">5922</a> of
that which ye have taken from me; but now restore me to my
lodging.” They replied, “Leave this knavery, O rascal! thine
intent is to sue us for thy clothes on the morrow.” The youth
cried, “By the truth of the One, the Eternal One, I will not sue
any for them!” but they said, “We find no way to this.” And
the Prefect bade them bear him to the Tigris and there slay him
and cast him into the stream. So they dragged him away, while
he wept and said the words which shall nowise shame the sayer:
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” When they came to the Tigris, one of
them drew the sword upon him and Al-Muradi said to the
sworder, “Smite off his head;” but one of them, hight Ahmad,
cried, “O folk, deal softly with this poor wretch and slay him not
unjustly and wickedly, for I stand in fear of Allah Almighty, lest
He burn me with his fire.” Quoth Al-Muradi, “A truce to this
talk!” and quoth the Ahmad aforesaid, “An ye do with him
aught, I will acquaint the Commander of the Faithful.” They
asked, “How, then, shall we do with him?” and he answered,
“Let us deposit him in prison and I will be answerable to you for
his provision; so shall we be quit of his blood, for indeed he is a
wronged man.” Accordingly they agreed to this and taking him up
cast him into the Prison of Blood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5923" id="noteref-5923" epub:type="noteref">5923</a> and then went their ways. So
far as regards them; but returning to the damsel, they carried her
to the Commander of the Faithful and she pleased him; so he
assigned her a chamber of the chambers of choice. She tarried in
the palace, neither eating nor drinking and weeping sans surcease
night and day, till, one night, the Caliph sent for her to his sitting-hall
and said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah, be of good cheer and keep
thine eyes cool of tear, for I will make thy rank higher than any
of the concubines and thou shalt see that which shall rejoice
thee.” She kissed ground and wept; whereupon the Prince of
True Believers called for her lute and bade her sing: so in
accordance with that which was in her heart, she sang these
improvised couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By the sheen of thy soul and the sheen of thy smile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5924" id="noteref-5924" epub:type="noteref">5924</a>, ✿ Say, moan’st thou for doubt or is’t ring-dove’s moan?</div>
      <div class="line">How many have died who by love were slain! ✿ Fails my patience but blaming my blamers wone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Now when she had made an end of her song, she threw the lute from
her hand and wept till she fainted away, whereupon the Caliph bade
carry her to her chamber. But he was fascinated by her and loved
her with exceeding love; so, after a while, he again commanded to
bring her in to the presence, and when she came, he ordered her
sing. Accordingly, she took the lute and chanted to it that which
was in her heart and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Have I patience and strength to support this despair? ✿ Ah, how couldst thou purpose afar to fare?</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art swayed by the spy to my cark and care: ✿ No marvel an branchlet sway here and there!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5925" id="noteref-5925" epub:type="noteref">5925</a></div>
      <div class="line">With unbearable load thou wouldst load me, still ✿ Thou loadest with love which I theewards bear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_c162a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>

<p class="c015">Then she cast the lute from her hand and fainted away; so she
was carried to her sleeping-chamber and indeed passion grew
upon her. After a long while, the Prince of True Believers sent
for her a third time and commanded her to sing. So she took
the lute and chanted these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O of piebald wild ye dunes sandy and drear, ✿ Shall the teenful lover ’scape teen and tear?</div>
      <div class="line">Shall ye see me joined with a lover, who ✿ Still flies or shall meet we in joyful cheer?</div>
      <div class="line">O hail to the fawn with the Houri eye, ✿ Like sun or moon on horizon clear!</div>
      <div class="line">He saith to lovers, “What look ye on?” ✿ And to stony hearts, “Say, what love ye dear”?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5926" id="noteref-5926" epub:type="noteref">5926</a></div>
      <div class="line">I pray to Him who departed us ✿ With severance-doom, “Be our union near!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her verse, the Commander of the
Faithful said to her, “O damsel, thou art in love.” She replied,
“Yes;” and he asked, “With whom?” Answered she, “With my
lord and sovran of my tenderness, for whom my love is as the
love of the earth for rain, or as the desire of the female for the
male; and indeed the love of him is mingled with my flesh and
my blood and hath entered into the channels of my bones. O
Prince of True Believers, whenever I call him to mind my vitals
are consumed, for that I have not yet won my wish of him, and
but that I fear to die, without seeing him, I had assuredly slain
myself.” Thereupon quoth he, “Art thou in my presence and
durst bespeak me with the like of these words? Forsure I will
gar thee forget thy lord.” Then he bade take her away; so she
was carried to her pavilion and he sent her a concubine, with a
casket wherein were three thousand ducats and a collar of gold
set with seed-pearls and great unions, and jewels, worth other
three thousand, saying to her, “The slave-girl and that which is
with her are a gift from me to thee.” When she heard this, she
cried, “Allah forfend that I be consoled for the love of my lord
and my master, though with an earth-full of gold!” And she
improvised and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By his life I swear, by his life I pray; ✿ For him fire I’d enter unful dismay!</div>
      <div class="line">“Console thee (cry they) with another fere ✿ Thou lovest!” and I, “By’s life, nay, NAY!”</div>
      <div class="line">He’s moon whom beauty and grace array; ✿ From whose cheeks and brow shineth light of day.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then the Commander of the Faithful summoned her to his
presence a fourth time and said, “O Sitt al-Milah, sing.” So she
recited and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The lover’s heart by his beloved is oft disheartenèd ✿ And by the hand of sickness eke his sprite dispiritèd,</div>
      <div class="line">One asked, “What is the taste of love?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5927" id="noteref-5927" epub:type="noteref">5927</a> and I to him replied, ✿ “Love is a sweet at first but oft in fine unsweetenèd.”</div>
      <div class="line">I am the thrall of Love who keeps the troth of love to them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5928" id="noteref-5928" epub:type="noteref">5928</a> ✿ But oft they proved themselves ’Urkúb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5929" id="noteref-5929" epub:type="noteref">5929</a> in pact with me they made.</div>
      <div class="line">What in their camp remains? They bound their loads and fared away; ✿ To other feres the veilèd Fairs in curtained litters sped;</div>
      <div class="line">At every station the beloved showed all of Joseph’s charms: ✿ The lover woned with Jacob’s woe in every shift of stead.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her song, she threw the lute
from her hand and wept herself a-swoon. So they sprinkled on
her musk-mingled rose-water and willow-flower water; and when
she came to her senses, Al-Rashid said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah,
this is not just dealing in thee. We love thee and thou lovest
another.” She replied, “O Commander of the Faithful, there is
no help for it.” Thereupon he was wroth with her and cried, “By
the virtue of Hamzah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5930" id="noteref-5930" epub:type="noteref">5930</a> and ’Akíl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5931" id="noteref-5931" epub:type="noteref">5931</a> and Mohammed, Prince of the
Apostles, an thou name in my presence one other than I, I will
assuredly order strike off thy head!” Then he bade return her to
her chamber, whilst she wept and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Oh brave!” I’d cry an I my death could view; ✿ My death were better than these griefs to rue,</div>
      <div class="line">Did sabre hew me limb by limb; this were ✿ Naught to affright a lover leal-true.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then the Caliph went in to the Lady Zubaydah, complexion-altered
with anger, and she noted this in him and said to him,
“How cometh it that I see the Commander of the Faithful
changed of colour?” He replied, “O daughter of my uncle, I
have a beautiful slave-girl, who reciteth verses by rote and telleth
various tales, and she hath taken my whole heart; but she loveth
other than myself and declareth that she affecteth her former lord;
so I have sworn a great oath that, if she come again to my sitting-hall
and sing for other than for me, I will assuredly shorten her
highest part by a span.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5932" id="noteref-5932" epub:type="noteref">5932</a> Quoth Zubaydah, “Let the Commander
of the Faithful favour me by presenting her, so I may look on her
and hear her singing.” Accordingly he bade fetch her and she came,
upon which the Lady Zubaydah withdrew behind the curtain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5933" id="noteref-5933" epub:type="noteref">5933</a> where
the damsel saw her not, and Al-Rashid said to her, “Sing to us.”
So she took the lute and tuning it, recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O my lord! since the day when I lost your sight, ✿ My life was ungladdened, my heart full of teen;</div>
      <div class="line">The memory of you kills me every night; ✿ And by all the worlds is my trace unseen;</div>
      <div class="line">All for love of a Fawn who hath snared my sprite ✿ By his love and his brow as the morning sheen.</div>
      <div class="line">Like a left hand parted from brother right ✿ I became by parting thro’ Fortune’s spleen.</div>
      <div class="line">On the brow of him Beauty deigned indite ✿ “Blest be Allah, whom best of Creators I ween!”</div>
      <div class="line">And Him I pray, who could disunite ✿ To reunite us. Then cry “Ameen!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5934" id="noteref-5934" epub:type="noteref">5934</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When Al-Rashid heard the end of this, he waxed exceeding
wroth and said, “May Allah not reunite you twain in gladness!”
Then he summoned the headsman, and when he presented himself,
he said to him, “Strike off the head of this accursed slave-girl.”
So Masrur took her by the hand and led her away; but, when she
came to the door, she turned and said to the Caliph, “O Commander
of the Faithful, I conjure thee, by thy fathers and forefathers,
behead me not until thou give ear to that I shall say!”
Then she improvised and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Emir of Justice, be to lieges kind ✿ For Justice ever guides thy generous mind;</div>
      <div class="line">And, oh, who blamest love to him inclining! ✿ Are lovers blamed for lâches undesigned?</div>
      <div class="line">By Him who gave thee rule, deign spare my life ✿ For rule on earth He hath to thee assigned.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then Masrur carried her to the other end of the sitting-hall and
bound her eyes and making her sit, stood awaiting a second order:
whereupon quoth the Lady Zubaydah, “O Prince of True Believers,
with thy permission, wilt thou not vouchsafe this damsel a
portion of thy clemency? An thou slay her, ’twere injustice.”
Quoth he, “What is to be done with her?” and quoth she, “Forbear
to slay her and send for her lord. If he be as she describeth
him in beauty and loveliness, she is excused, and if he be not on
this wise then kill her, and this shall be thy plea against her.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5935" id="noteref-5935" epub:type="noteref">5935</a>
Al-Rashid replied, “No harm in this rede;” and caused return the
damsel to her chamber, saying to her, “The Lady Zubaydah saith
thus and thus.” She rejoined, “God requite her for me with good!
Indeed, thou dealest equitably, O Commander of the Faithful, in
this judgment.” And he retorted, “Go now to thy place, and to-morrow
we will bid them bring thy lord.” So she kissed ground
and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I indeed will well for whom love I will: ✿ Let chider chide and let blamer blame:</div>
      <div class="line">All lives must die at fixt tide and term ✿ But I must die ere my life-term came:</div>
      <div class="line">Then Oh whose love hath afflicted me ✿ Well<a id="t167"></a> I will but thy presence in haste I claim.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then she arose and returned to her chamber. Now on the
morrow, the Commander of the Faithful sat in his hall of
audience and his Wazir Ja’afar bin Yahya the Barmecide came in
to him; whereupon he called to him, saying, “I would have thee
bring me a youth who is lately come to Baghdad, hight Sidi
Nur al-Din Ali the Damascene.” Quoth Ja’afar, “Hearing and
obeying,” and going forth in quest of the youth, sent to the bazars
and Wakalahs and Khans for three successive days, but discovered
no trace of him, neither happened upon the place of him. So on
the fourth day he presented himself before the Caliph and said to
him, “O our lord, I have sought him these three days, but have not
found him.” Said Al-Rashid, “Make ready letters to Damascus.
Peradventure he hath returned to his own land.” Accordingly
Ja’afar wrote a letter and despatched it by a dromedary-courier to
the Damascus-city; and they sought him there and found him not.
Meanwhile, news was brought that Khorasan had been conquered;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5936" id="noteref-5936" epub:type="noteref">5936</a>
whereupon Al-Rashid rejoiced and bade decorate Baghdad and
release all in the gaol, giving each of them a ducat and a dress.
So Ja’afar applied himself to the adornment of the city and bade
his brother Al-Fazl ride to the prison and robe and set free the
prisoners. Al-Fazl did as his brother commanded and released all
save the young Damascene, who abode still in the Prison of Blood,
saying, “There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great! Verily, we are God’s and to Him are we
returning.” Then quoth Al-Fazl to the gaoler, “Is there any left
in the prison?” Quoth he, “No,” and Al-Fazl was about to
depart, when Nur al-Din called out to him from within the prison,
saying, “O our lord, tarry awhile, for there remaineth none in the
prison other than I and indeed I am wronged. This is a day of
pardon and there is no disputing concerning it.” Al-Fazl bade
release him; so they set him free and he gave him a dress and a
ducat. Thereupon the young man went out, bewildered and
unknowing whither he should wend, for that he had sojourned in
the gaol a year or so and indeed his condition was changed and
his favour fouled, and he abode walking and turning round, lest
Al-Muradi come upon him and cast him into another calamity.
When Al-Muradi learnt his release, he betook himself to the Wali
and said, “O our lord, we are not assured of our lives from that
youth, because he hath been freed from prison and we fear lest
he complain of us.” Quoth the Chief, “How shall we do?” and
quoth Al-Muradi, “I will cast him into a calamity for thee.” Then
he ceased not to follow the Damascene from place to place till he
came up with him in a narrow stead and <i><span xml:lang="fr">cul-de-sac</span></i>; whereupon he
accosted him and casting a cord about his neck, cried out, “A
thief!” The folk flocked to him from all sides and fell to beating
and abusing Nur al-Din,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5937" id="noteref-5937" epub:type="noteref">5937</a> whilst he cried out for aidance but none
aided him, and Al-Muradi kept saying to him, “But yesterday
the Commander of the Faithful released thee and to-day thou
robbest!” So the hearts of the mob were hardened against him
and again Al-Muradi carried him to the Chief of Police, who bade
hew off his hand. Accordingly, the hangman took him and
bringing out the knife, proceeded to cut off his hand, while Al-Muradi
said to him, “Cut and sever the bone and fry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5938" id="noteref-5938" epub:type="noteref">5938</a> not in oil the
stump for him, so he may lose all his blood and we be at rest from
him.” But Ahmad, he who had before been the cause of his
deliverance, sprang up to him and cried, “O folk, fear Allah in
your action with this youth, for that I know his affair, first and
last, and he is clear of offence and guiltless: he is of the lords of
houses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5939" id="noteref-5939" epub:type="noteref">5939</a> and unless ye desist from him, I will go up to the
Commander of the Faithful and acquaint him with the case from
beginning to end and that the youth is innocent of sin or crime.”
Quoth Al-Muradi, “Indeed, we are not assured from his mischief;”
and quoth Ahmad, “Set him free and commit him to me and I
will warrant you against his doings, for ye shall never see him
again after this.” So they delivered Nur al-Din to him and he
took him from their hands and said to him, “O youth, have ruth
on thyself, for indeed thou hast fallen into the hands of these folk
twice and if they prevail over thee a third time, they will make an
end of thee; and I in doing thus with thee, aim at reward for thee
and recompense in Heaven and answer of prayer.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5940" id="noteref-5940" epub:type="noteref">5940</a> So Nur al-Din
fell to kissing his hand and blessing him said, “Know that I
am a stranger in this your city and the completion of kindness is
better than its commencement; wherefore I pray thee of thy
favour that thou make perfect to me thy good offices and
generosity and bring me to the city-gate. So will thy beneficence
be accomplished unto me and may God Almighty requite thee for
me with good!” Ahmad replied, “No harm shall betide thee:
go; I will bear thee company till thou come to thy place of
safety.” And he left him not till he brought him to the city-gate
and said to him, “O youth, go in Allah’s guard and return not to
the city; for, an they fall in with thee again, they will make an
end of thee.” Nur al-Din kissed his hand and going forth the city,
gave not over walking till he came to a mosque that stood in one
of the suburbs of Baghdad and entered therein with the night.
Now he had with him naught wherewith he might cover himself;
so he wrapped himself up in one of the mats of the mosque and
thus abode till dawn, when the Muezzins came and finding him
seated in such case, said to him, “O youth, what is this plight?”
Said he, “I cast myself on your protection, imploring your defence
from a company of folk who seek to slay me unjustly and
wrongously, without cause.” And one of the Muezzins said, “I
will protect thee; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of
tear.” Then he brought him old clothes and covered him therewith;
he also set before him somewhat of victual and seeing upon
him signs of fine breeding, said to him, “O my son, I grow old
and desiring help from thee, I will do away thy necessity.” Nur
al-Din replied, “To hear is to obey;” and abode with the old
man, who rested and took his ease, while the youth did his service
in the mosque, celebrating the praises of Allah and calling the
Faithful to prayer and lighting the lamps and filling the spout-pots<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5941" id="noteref-5941" epub:type="noteref">5941</a>
and sweeping and cleaning out the place of worship on thiswise it
befel the young Damascene; but as regards Sitt al-Milah, the
Lady Zubaydah, the wife of the Commander of the Faithful, made
a banquet in her palace and assembled her slave-girls. And the
damsel came, weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted, and those present
blamed her for this, whereupon she recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ye blame the mourner who weeps his woe; ✿ Needs must the mourner sing, weeping sore;</div>
      <div class="line">An I see not some happy day I’ll weep ✿ Brine-tears till followed by gouts of gore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her verses, the Lady Zubaydah
bade each damsel sing a song, till the turn came round to
Sitt al-Milah, whereupon she took the lute and tuning it, carolled
thereto four-and-twenty carols in four-and-twenty modes; then
she returned to the first and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The World hath shot me with all her shafts ✿ Departing friends parting-grief t’ aby:</div>
      <div class="line">So in heart the burn of all hearts I bear ✿ And in eyes the tear-drops of every eye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her song, she wept till she garred
the bystanders weep and the Lady Zubaydah condoled with her
and said to her, “Allah upon thee, O Sitt al-Milah, sing us
somewhat, so we may hearken to thee.” The damsel replied,
“Hearing and obeying,” and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">People of passion, assemble ye! ✿ This day be the day of our agony:</div>
      <div class="line">The Raven o’<a id="t171"></a> severance croaks at our doors; ✿ Our raven which nigh to us aye see we.</div>
      <div class="line">The friends we love have appointed us ✿ The grievousest parting-dule to dree.</div>
      <div class="line">Rise, by your lives, and let all at once ✿ Fare to seek our friends where their sight we see.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then she threw the lute from her hand and shed tears till she
drew tears from the Lady Zubaydah who said to her, “O Sitt al-Milah,
he whom thou lovest methinks is not in this world, for
the Commander of the Faithful hath sought him in every
place, but hath not found him.” Whereupon the damsel arose
and kissing the Princess’s hands, said to her, “O my lady,
an thou wouldst have him found, I have this night a request
to make whereby thou mayst win my need with the Caliph.”
Quoth the Lady, “And what is it;” and quoth Sitt al-Milah,
“’Tis that thou get me leave to fare forth by myself and
go round about in quest of him three days, for the adage
saith, Whoso keeneth for herself is not like whoso is hired
to keen!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5942" id="noteref-5942" epub:type="noteref">5942</a> An if I find him, I will bring him before the
Commander of the Faithful, so he may do with us what he will,
and if I find him not, I shall be cut off from hope of him and
the heat of that which is with me will be cooled.” Quoth the
Lady Zubaydah, “I will not get thee leave from him but for
a whole month; so be of good cheer and eyes cool and clear.”
Whereat Sitt al-Milah rejoiced and rising, kissed ground before
her once more and went away to her own place, and right glad
was she. As for Zubaydah, she went in to the Caliph and
talked with him awhile; then she fell to kissing him between
the eyes and on his hand and asked him for that which she
had promised to Sitt al-Milah, saying, “O Commander of the
Faithful, I doubt me her lord is not found in this world; but, an
she go about seeking him and find him not, her hopes will be
cut off and her mind will be set at rest and she will sport and
laugh; and indeed while she nourisheth hope, she will never
take the right direction.” And she ceased not cajoling him
till he gave Sitt al-Milah leave to fare forth and make search
for her lord a month’s space and ordered her a riding-mule
and an eunuch to attend her and bade the privy purse give
her all she needed, were it a thousand dirhams a day or even
more. So the Lady Zubaydah arose and returning to her palace
bade summon Sitt al-Milah and, as soon as she came, acquainted
her with that which had passed; whereupon she kissed her hand
and thanked her and called down blessings on her. Then she
took leave of the Princess and veiling her face with a mask<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5943" id="noteref-5943" epub:type="noteref">5943</a>,
disguised herself;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5944" id="noteref-5944" epub:type="noteref">5944</a> after which she mounted the she-mule and
sallying forth, went round about seeking her lord in the highways
of Baghdad three days’ space, but happed on no tidings of him;
and on the fourth day, she rode forth without the city. Now
it was the noon-hour and fierce was the heat, and she was aweary
and thirst came upon her. Presently, she reached the mosque of
the Shaykh who had lodged the young Damascene, and dismounting
at the door, said to the old Muezzin, “O Shaykh, hast
thou a draught of cold water? Verily, I am overcome with heat
and thirst.” Said he, “’Tis with me in my house.” So he
carried her up into his lodging and spreading her a carpet,
seated her; after which he brought her cold water and she drank
and said to the eunuch, “Go thy ways with the mule and to-morrow
come back to me here.” Accordingly he went away and
she slept and rested herself. When she awoke, she asked the old
man, “O Shaykh, hast thou aught of food?” and he answered,
“O my lady, I have bread and olives.” Quoth she, “That be
food which befitteth only the like of thee. As for me, I will
have naught save roast lamb and soups and reddened fowls
right fat and ducks farcis with all manner stuffing of pistachio-nuts
and sugar.” Quoth the Muezzin, “O my lady, I have never
heard of this chapter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5945" id="noteref-5945" epub:type="noteref">5945</a> in the Koran, nor was it revealed to our
lord Mohammed, whom Allah save and assain!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5946" id="noteref-5946" epub:type="noteref">5946</a> She laughed
and said, “O Shaykh, the matter is even as thou sayest; but
bring me pen-case and paper.” So he brought her what she
sought and she wrote a note and gave it to him, together with a
seal-ring from her finger, saying, “Go into the city and enquire for
Such-an-one the Shroff and give him this my note.” Accordingly
the oldster betook himself to the city, as she bade him, and asked
for the money-changer, to whom they directed him. So he gave
him ring and writ, seeing which, he kissed the letter and breaking
it open, read it and apprehended its contents. Then he repaired
to the bazar and buying all that she bade him, laid it in a porter’s
crate and made him go with the Shaykh. The old man took
the Hammál and went with him to the mosque, where he
relieved him of his burden and carried the rich viands in to
Sitt al-Milah. She seated him by her side and they ate, he
and she, of those dainty cates, till they were satisfied, when
the Shaykh rose and removed the food from before her. She
passed that night in his lodging and when she got up in the
morning, she said to him, “O elder, may I not lack thy kind
offices for the breakfast! Go to the Shroff and fetch me from
him the like of yesterday’s food.” So he arose and betaking
himself to the money-changer, acquainted him with that which
she had bidden him. The Shroff brought him all she required
and set it on the heads of Hammals; and the Shaykh took
them and returned with them to the damsel, when she sat down
with him and they ate their sufficiency, after which he removed
the rest of the meats. Then she took the fruits and the flowers
and setting them over against herself, wrought them into rings
and knots and writs, whilst the Shaykh looked on at a thing
whose like he had never in his life seen and rejoiced in the sight.
Presently said she to him, “O elder, I would fain drink.” So he
arose and brought her a gugglet of water; but she cried to him,
“Who said to thee Fetch that?” Quoth he, “Saidst thou not to
me, I would fain drink?” and quoth she, “I want not this; nay,
I want wine, the solace of the soul, so haply, O Shaykh, I may
refresh myself therewith.” Exclaimed the old man, “Allah forfend
that strong drink be drunk in my house, and I a stranger in the
land and a Muezzin and an Imam, who leadeth the True Believers
in prayer, and a servant of the House of the Lord of the three
Worlds!” “Why wilt thou forbid me to drink thereof in thy
house?” “Because ’tis unlawful.” “O elder, Allah hath forbidden
only the eating of blood and carrion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5947" id="noteref-5947" epub:type="noteref">5947</a> and hog’s flesh:
tell me, are grapes and honey lawful or unlawful?” “They are
lawful.” “This is the juice of grapes and the water of honey.”
“Leave this thy talk, for thou shalt never drink wine in my house.”
“O Shaykh, people eat and drink and enjoy themselves and we are
of the number of the folk and Allah is indulgent and merciful.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5948" id="noteref-5948" epub:type="noteref">5948</a>
“This is a thing that may not be.” “Hast thou not heard what
the poet saith?” And she recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Cease thou to hear, O Sim’án-son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5949" id="noteref-5949" epub:type="noteref">5949</a> aught save the say of me; ✿ How bitter ’twas to quit the monks and fly the monast’ry!</div>
      <div class="line">When, on the Fête of Palms there stood, amid the hallowed fane<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5950" id="noteref-5950" epub:type="noteref">5950</a>, ✿ A pretty Fawn whose lovely pride garred me sore wrong to dree.</div>

<p class="c015">She then asked him, “O Shaykh, an Moslems and Jews and
Nazarenes drink wine, who are we that we should reject it?”
Answered he, “By Allah, O my lady, spare thy pains, for this be a
thing whereto I will not hearken.” When she knew that he would
not consent to her desire, she said to him, “O Shaykh, I am of
the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful and the food
waxeth heavy on me and if I drink not, I shall die of indigestion,
nor wilt thou be assured against the issue of my case.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5951" id="noteref-5951" epub:type="noteref">5951</a> As for me,
I acquit myself of blame towards thee, for that I have bidden
thee beware of the wrath of the Commander of the Faithful, after
making myself known to thee.” When the Shaykh heard her
words and that wherewith she threatened him, he sprang up and
went out, perplexed and unknowing what he should do, and there
met him a Jewish man, which was his neighbour, and said to him,
“How cometh it that I see thee, O Shaykh, strait of breast? Eke,
I hear in thy house a noise of talk, such as I am unwont to hear
with thee.” Quoth the Muezzin, “’Tis of a damsel who declareth
that she is of the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful,
Harun al-Rashid; and she hath eaten meat and now would drink
wine in my house, but I forbade her. However she asserteth that
unless she drink thereof, she will die, and indeed I am bewildered
concerning my case.” Answered the Jew, “Know, O my neighbour,
that the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful are
used to drink wine, and when they eat and drink not, they die;
and I fear lest happen some mishap to her, when thou wouldst not
be safe from the Caliph’s fury.” The Shaykh asked, “What is to
be done?” and the Jew answered, “I have old wine that will suit
her.” Quoth the Shaykh, “By the right of neighbourship, deliver
me from this descent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5952" id="noteref-5952" epub:type="noteref">5952</a> of calamity and let me have that which is
with thee!” Quoth the Jew, “Bismillah, in the name of Allah,”
and passing to his quarters, brought out a glass flask of wine,
wherewith the Shaykh returned to Sitt al-Milah. This pleased her
and she cried to him, “Whence hadst thou this?” He replied, “I
got it from the Jew, my neighbour: I set forth to him my case with
thee and he gave me this.” Thereupon Sitt al-Milah filled a cup
and emptied it; after which she drank a second and a third. Then
she crowned the cup a fourth time and handed it to the Shaykh, but
he would not accept it from her. However, she conjured him, by
her own head and that of the Prince of True Believers, that
he take the cup from her, till he received it from her hand and
kissed it and would have set it down; but she sware him by her life
to smell it. Accordingly he smelt it and she said to him, “How
deemest thou?” Said he, “I find its smell is sweet;” and she
conjured him by the Caliph’s life to taste thereof. So he put it to
his mouth and she rose to him and made him drink; whereupon
quoth he, “O Princess of the Fair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5953" id="noteref-5953" epub:type="noteref">5953</a> this is none other than good.”
Quoth she, “So deem I: hath not our Lord promised us wine in
Paradise?” He answered, “Yes! The Most High saith:—And
rivers of wine, delicious to the drinkers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5954" id="noteref-5954" epub:type="noteref">5954</a> And we will drink
it in this world and in the next world.” She laughed and emptying
the cup, gave him to drink, and he said, “O Princess of the
Fair, indeed thou art excusable in thy love for this.” Then he hent
in hand from her another and another, till he became drunken and
his talk waxed great and his prattle. The folk of the quarter
heard him and assembled under the window; and when the Shaykh
was ware of them, he opened the window and said to them, “Are
ye not ashamed, O pimps? Every one in his own house doth
whatso he willeth and none hindereth him; but we drink one single
day and ye assemble and come, panders that ye are! To-day,
wine, and to-morrow business;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5955" id="noteref-5955" epub:type="noteref">5955</a> and from hour to hour cometh
relief.” So they laughed together and dispersed. Then the girl
drank till she was drunken, when she called to mind her lord
and wept, and the Shaykh said to her, “What maketh thee weep,
O my lady?” Said she, “O elder, I am a lover and a separated.”
He cried, “O my lady, what is this love?” Cried she, “And
thou, hast thou never been in love?” He replied, “By Allah, O
my lady, never in all my life heard I of this thing, nor have I ever
known it! Is it of the sons of Adam or of the Jinn?” She
laughed and said, “Verily, thou art even as those of whom the
poet speaketh, in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How oft shall they admonish and ye shun this nourishment; ✿ When e’en the shepherd’s bidding is obeyèd by his flocks?</div>
      <div class="line">I see you like in shape and form to creatures whom we term ✿ Mankind, but in your acts and deeds you are a sort of ox.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5956" id="noteref-5956" epub:type="noteref">5956</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">The Shaykh laughed at her speech and her verses pleased him.
Then cried she to him, “I desire of thee a lute.” So he arose and
brought her a bit of fuel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5957" id="noteref-5957" epub:type="noteref">5957</a> Quoth she, “What is that?” and
quoth he “Didst thou not say: Bring me fuel?” Said she, “I
do not want this,” and said he, “What then is it that is hight fuel,
other than this?” She laughed and replied, “The lute is an
instrument of music, whereunto I sing.” Asked he, “Where is this
thing found and of whom shall I get it for thee?” and answered
she, “Of him who gave thee the wine.” So he arose and betaking
himself to his neighbour the Jew, said to him “Thou
favouredst us before with the wine; so now complete thy favours
and look me out a thing hight lute, which be an instrument for
singing; for she seeketh this of me and I know it not.” Replied
the Jew, “Hearkening and obedience,” and going into his
house, brought him a lute. The old man carried it to Sitt
al-Milah, whilst the Jew took his drink and sat by a window
adjoining the Shaykh’s house, so he might hear the singing. The
damsel rejoiced, when the old man returned to her with the lute, and
taking it from him, tuned its strings and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Remains not, after you are gone, or trace of you or sign, ✿ But hope to see this parting end and break its lengthy line:</div>
      <div class="line">You went and by your wending made the whole world desolate; ✿ And none may stand this day in stead to fill the yearning eyne.</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed, you’ve burdened weakling me, by strength and force of you ✿ With load no hill hath power t’upheave nor yet the plain low li’en:</div>
      <div class="line">And I, whenever fain I scent the breeze your land o’erbreathes, ✿ Lose all my wits as though they were bemused with heady wine.</div>
      <div class="line">O folk no light affair is Love for lover woe to dree ✿ Nor easy ’tis to satisfy its sorrow and repine.</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve wandered East and West to hap upon your trace, and when ✿ Springcamps I find the dwellers cry, “They’ve marched, those friends o’ thine!”</div>
      <div class="line">Never accustomed me to part these intimates I love; ✿ Nay, when I left them all were wont new meetings to design.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Now when she had ended her song, she wept with sore weeping,
till presently sleep overcame her and she slept. On the
morrow, she said to the Shaykh, “Get thee to the Shroff and fetch
me the ordinary;” so he repaired to the money-changer and
delivered him the message, whereupon he made ready meat and
drink, according to his custom, with which the old man returned
to the damsel and they ate their sufficiency. When she had eaten,
she sought of him wine and he went to the Jew and fetched it.
Then the twain sat down and drank; and when she waxed
drunken, she took the lute and smiting it, fell a-singing and
chanted these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How long ask I the heart, the heart drowned, and eke ✿ Refrain my complaint while my tear-floods speak?</div>
      <div class="line">They forbid e’en the phantom to visit me, ✿ (O marvel!) her phantom my couch to seek.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5958" id="noteref-5958" epub:type="noteref">5958</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">And when she had made an end of her song, she wept with sore
weeping. All this time, the young Damascene was listening, and
now he likened her voice to the voice of his slave-girl and then he
put away from him this thought, and the damsel had no knowledge
whatever of his presence. Then she broke out again into
song and chanted these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Quoth they, “Forget him! What is he?” To them I cried, ✿ “Allah forget me when forget I mine adored!”</div>
      <div class="line">Now in this world shall I forget the love o’ you? ✿ Heaven grant the thrall may ne’er forget to love his lord!</div>
      <div class="line">I pray that Allah pardon all except thy love ✿ Which, when I meet Him may my bestest plea afford.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">After ending this song she drank three cups and filling the old
man other three, improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">His love he hid which tell-tale tears betrayed; ✿ For burn of coal that ’neath his ribs was laid:</div>
      <div class="line">Giv’n that he seek his joy in spring and flowers ✿ Some day, his spring’s the face of dear-loved maid.</div>
      <div class="line">O ye who blame me for who baulks my love! ✿ What sweeter thing than boon to man denayed?</div>
      <div class="line">A sun, yet scorcheth he my very heart! ✿ A moon, but riseth he from breasts a-shade!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her song, she threw the lute from
her hand and wept, whilst the Shaykh wept for her weeping.
Then she fell down in a fainting fit and presently recovering,
crowned the cup and drinking it off, gave the elder to drink, after
which she took the lute and breaking out into song, chanted
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thy parting is bestest of woes to my heart, ✿ And changed my case till all sleep it eschewed:</div>
      <div class="line">The world to my being is desolate; ✿ Then Oh grief! and Oh lingering solitude!</div>
      <div class="line">Maybe The Ruthful incline thee to me ✿ And join us despite what our foes have sued!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">Then she wept till her voice rose high and her wailing was discovered
to those without; after which she again began to drink
and plying the Shaykh with wine, sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An they hid thy person from eyen-sight, ✿ They hid not thy name fro’ my mindful sprite:</div>
      <div class="line">Or meet me; thy ransom for meeting I’ll be!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5959" id="noteref-5959" epub:type="noteref">5959</a> ✿ Or fly me; and ransom I’ll be for thy flight!</div>
      <div class="line">Mine outer speaks for mine inner case, ✿ And mine inner speaks for mine outer plight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her verses, she threw the lute from
her hand and wept and wailed. Then she slept awhile and presently
awaking, said, “O Shaykh, say me, hast thou what we may eat?”
He replied, “O my lady, I have the rest of the food;” but she
cried, “I will not eat of the orts I have left. Go down to the bazar
and fetch us what we may eat.” He rejoined, “Excuse me, O
my lady, I cannot rise to my feet, because I am bemused with
wine; but with me is the servant of the mosque, who is a sharp
youth and an intelligent. I will call him, so he may buy thee whatso
thou wantest.” Asked she, “Whence hast thou this servant?”
and he answered, “He is of the people of Damascus.” When she
heard him say “of the people of Damascus,” she sobbed such a
sob that she swooned away; and when she came to herself, she
said, “Woe is me for the people of Damascus and for those who
are therein! Call him, O Shaykh, that he may do our need.”
Accordingly, the old man put his head forth of the window and
called the youth, who came to him from the mosque and sought
leave to enter. The Muezzin bade him come in, and when he
appeared before the damsel, he knew her and she knew him;
whereupon he turned back in bewilderment and would have fled
at hap-hazard; but she sprang up to him and held him fast, and they
embraced and wept together, till they fell to the floor in a fainting
fit. When the Shaykh saw them in this condition, he feared for
himself and fared forth in fright, seeing not the way for drunkenness.
His neighbour the Jew met him and asked him, “How is
it that I behold thee astounded?” Answered the old man, “How
should I not be astounded, seeing that the damsel who is with me
is fallen in love with the mosque servant and they have embraced
and slipped down in a swoon? Indeed, I fear lest the Caliph
come to know of this and be wroth with me; so tell me thou what
is thy device for that wherewith I am afflicted in the matter of
this damsel.” Quoth the Jew, “For the present, take this casting-bottle
of rose-water and go forthright and sprinkle them therewith:
an they be aswoon for this their union and embrace, they
will recover, and if otherwise, then take to flight.” The Shakyh
snatched the casting-bottle from the Jew and going up to the
twain, sprinkled their faces, whereupon they came to themselves
and fell to relating each to other that which they had suffered,
since both had been parted, for the pangs of severance.
Nur al-Din also acquainted Sitt al-Milah with that which he had
endured from the folk who would have killed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5960" id="noteref-5960" epub:type="noteref">5960</a> him and utterly
annihilated him; and she said to him, “O my lord, let us for the
nonce leave this talk and praise Allah for reunion of loves, and all
this shall cease from us.” Then she gave him the cup and he said,
“By Allah, I will on no wise drink it, whilst I am in this case!”
So she drank it off before him and taking the lute, swept the
strings and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O absent fro’ me and yet present in place, ✿ Thou art far from mine eyes and yet ever nigh!</div>
      <div class="line">Thy farness bequeathed me all sorrow and care ✿ And my troublous life can no joy espy:</div>
      <div class="line">Lone, forlorn, weeping-eyelidded, miserablest, ✿ I abide for thy sake as though banisht I:</div>
      <div class="line">Then (ah grief o’ me!) far thou hast fared from sight ✿ Yet canst no more depart me than apple of eye!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When she had made an end of her verse, she wept and the young
man of Damascus, Nur al-Din, wept also. Then she took the
lute and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Well Allah wots I never namèd you ✿ But tears o’erbrimming eyes in floods outburst;</div>
      <div class="line">And passion raged and pine would do me die, ✿ Yet my heart rested wi’ the thought it nurst;</div>
      <div class="line">O eye-light mine, O wish and O my hope! ✿ Your face can never quench mine eyes’ hot thirst.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">When Nur al-Din heard these his slave-girl’s verses, he fell
a-weeping, while she strained him to her bosom and wiped away
his tears with her sleeve and questioned him and comforted his
mind. Then she took the lute and sweeping its strings, played
thereon with such performing as would move the staidest to
delight and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed, what day brings not your sight to me. ✿ That day I rem’mber not as dight to me!</div>
      <div class="line">And, when I vainly long on you to look, ✿ My life is lost, Oh life and light o’ me!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c015">After this fashion they fared till the morning, tasting not the
nourishment of sleep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5961" id="noteref-5961" epub:type="noteref">5961</a>; and when the day lightened, behold the
eunuch came with the she-mule and said to Sitt al-Milah, “The
Commander of the Faithful calleth for thee.” So she arose and
taking by the hand her lord, committed him to the Shaykh, saying,
“This is the deposit of Allah, then thy deposit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5962" id="noteref-5962" epub:type="noteref">5962</a> till this eunuch
cometh to thee; and indeed, O elder, my due to thee is the white
hand of favour such as filleth the interval betwixt heaven and
earth.” Then she mounted the mule and repairing to the palace of
the Commander of the Faithful, went in to him and kissed ground
before him. Quoth he to her, as who should make mock of her, “I
doubt not but thou hast found thy lord;” and quoth she, “By thy
felicity and the length of thy continuance on life, I have indeed
found him!” Now Al-Rashid was leaning back; but, when he
heard this, he sat upright and said to her, “By my life, true?”
She replied, “Ay, by thy life!” He said, “Bring him into my
presence, so I may see him;” but she said, “O my lord, there
have happened to him many hardships and his charms are changed
and his favour faded; and indeed the Prince of True Believers
vouchsafed me a month; wherefore I will tend him the rest of the
month and then bring him to do his service to the Commander
of the Faithful.” Quoth Al-Rashid, “Sooth thou sayest: the
condition certainly was for a month; but tell me what hath
betided him.” Quoth she, “O my lord (Allah prolong thy
continuance and make Paradise thy place of returning and thine
asylum and the fire the abiding-place of thy foes!), when he
presenteth himself to serve thee, he will assuredly expound to thee
his case and will name to thee his wrong-doers; and indeed this is
an arrear that is due to the Prince of True Believers, by whom
may Allah fortify the Faith and vouchsafe him the victory over
rebel and froward wretch!” Thereupon he ordered her a fine
house and bade furnish it with carpets and vessels of choice and
commanded them to give all she needed. This was done during
the rest of the day, and when the night came, she sent the eunuch
with a suit of clothes and the mule, to fetch Nur al-Din from the
Muezzin’s lodging. So the young man donned the dress and
mounting, rode to the house, where he abode in comfort and
luxury a full-told month, while she solaced him with four things,
the eating of fowls and the drinking of wine and the sleeping
upon brocade and the entering the bath after horizontal refreshment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5963" id="noteref-5963" epub:type="noteref">5963</a>
Furthermore, she brought him six suits of linen stuffs and
took to changing his clothes day by day; nor was the appointed
time of delay accomplished ere his beauty and loveliness returned
to him; nay, his favour waxed tenfold fairer and he became a
seduction to all who looked upon him. One day of the days Al-Rashid
bade bring him to the presence; so his slave-girl changed
his clothes and robing him in sumptuous raiment, mounted him on
the she-mule. Then he rode to the palace and presenting himself
before the Caliph, saluted him with the goodliest of salutations
and bespake him with Truchman’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5964" id="noteref-5964" epub:type="noteref">5964</a> speech eloquent and deep-thoughted.
When Al-Rashid saw him, he marvelled at the
seemliness of his semblance and his loquence and eloquence and
asking of him, was told that he was Sitt al-Milah’s lord; whereupon
quoth he, “Indeed, she is excusable in her love for him, and
if we had put her to death wrongfully, as we were minded to do,
her blood would have been upon our heads.” Then he accosted
the young man and entering into discourse with him, found him
well-bred, intelligent, clever, quick-witted, generous, pleasant,
elegant, excellent. So he loved him with exceeding love and
questioned him of his native city and of his sire and of the cause
of his journey to Baghdad. Nur al-Din acquainted him with
that which he would know in the goodliest words and concisest
phrases; and the Caliph asked him, “And where hast thou been
absent all this while? Verily, we sent after thee to Damascus
and Mosul and all other cities, but happened on no tidings of
thee.” Answered the young man, “O my lord, there betided thy
slave in thy capital that which never yet betided any.” Then he
acquainted him with his case, first and last, and told him that
which had befallen him of evil from Al-Muradi and the Chief of
Police. Now when Al-Rashid heard this, he was chagrined with
sore chagrin and waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and cried,
“Shall this thing happen in a city wherein I am?” And the
Háshimí vein<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5965" id="noteref-5965" epub:type="noteref">5965</a> started out between his eyes. Then he bade fetch
Ja’afar, and when he came between his hands, he acquainted him
with the adventure and said to him, “Shall this thing come to pass
in my city and I have no news of it?” Thereupon he bade
Ja’afar fetch all whom the young Damascene had named, and
when they came, he bade smite their necks: he also summoned
him whom they called Ahmad and who had been the means of
the young man’s deliverance a first time and a second, and thanked
him and showed him favour and bestowed on him a costly robe of
honour and made him Chief of Police in his city.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5966" id="noteref-5966" epub:type="noteref">5966</a> Then he sent
for the Shaykh, the Muezzin, and when the messenger came to
him and told him that the Commander of the Faithful summoned
him, he feared the denunciation of the damsel and walked with
him to the palace, farting for fear as he went, whilst all who passed
him by laughed at him. When he came into the presence of the
Commander of the Faithful, he fell a-trembling and his tongue
was tied,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5967" id="noteref-5967" epub:type="noteref">5967</a> so that he could not speak. The Caliph smiled at him
and said, “O Shaykh, thou hast done no offence; so why fearest
thou?” Answered the old man (and indeed he was in the sorest
of that which may be of fear), “O my lord, by the virtue of thy pure
forefathers, indeed I have done naught, and do thou enquire of my
manners and morals.” The Caliph laughed at him and ordering
him a thousand dinars, bestowed on him a costly robe of honour
and made him headman of the Muezzins in his mosque. Then
he called Sitt al-Milah and said to her, “The house wherein thou
lodgest with all it containeth is a largesse to thy lord: so do thou
take him and depart with him in the safeguard of Allah Almighty;
but absent not yourselves from our presence.” Accordingly she
went forth with the young Damascene and when she came to the
house, she found that the Prince of True Believers had sent them
gifts galore and good things in store. As for Nur al-Din, he sent
for his father and mother and appointed for himself agents in the
city of Damascus, to receive the rent of the houses and gardens and
Wakalahs and Hammams; and they occupied themselves with
collecting that which accrued to him and sending it to him every
year. Meanwhile, his father and mother came to him, with that
which they had of monies and merchandise of price and, foregathering
with their son, found that he was become of the chief
officers and familiars of the Commander of the Faithful and of
the number of his sitting-companions and nightly entertainers,
wherefore they rejoiced in reunion with him and he also rejoiced
in them. The Caliph assigned them solde and allowances; and
as for Nur al-Din, his father brought him those riches and his
wealth waxed and his estate was stablished, till he became the
richest of the folk of his time in Baghdad and left not the presence
of the Commander of the Faithful or by night or by day. He was
vouchsafed issue by Sitt al-Milah, and he ceased not to live the
goodliest of lives, he and she and his father and his mother, a while
of time, till Abu al-Hasan sickened of a sore sickness and departed
to the mercy of Allah Almighty. Presently, his mother also died
and he carried them forth and shrouded them and buried and made
them expiations and funeral ceremonies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5968" id="noteref-5968" epub:type="noteref">5968</a> In due course his
children grew up and became like moons, and he reared them
in splendour and affection, while his wealth waxed and his case
never waned. He ceased not to pay frequent visits to the
Commander of the Faithful, he and his children and his slave-girl
Sitt al-Milah, and they abode in all solace of life and prosperity
till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the
Sunderer of societies; and laud to the Abiding, the Eternal!
This is all that hath come down to us of their story.</p>
