			<h2 epub:type="title">The Concubine of Al-Maamún<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6097" id="noteref-6097" epub:type="noteref">6097</a></h2>

<p>As I sat one day in my shop, there came up to me a fair woman,
as she were the moon at its rising, and with her a hand-maid.
Now I was a handsome man in my time; so that lady sat down
on my shop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6098" id="noteref-6098" epub:type="noteref">6098</a> and buying stuffs of me, paid the price and went her
ways. I asked the girl anent her and she answered, “I know not
her name.” Quoth I, “Where is her abode?” Quoth she, “In
heaven;” and I, “She is presently on the earth; so when doth
she ascend to heaven and where is the ladder by which she goeth
up?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6099" id="noteref-6099" epub:type="noteref">6099</a> The girl retorted, “She hath her lodging in a palace
between two rivers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6100" id="noteref-6100" epub:type="noteref">6100</a> that is, in the palace of Al-Maamún al-Hákim
bi-Amri ’llah.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6101" id="noteref-6101" epub:type="noteref">6101</a> Then said I, “I am a dead man, without
a doubt;” but she replied, “Have patience, for needs must she
return to thee and buy other stuffs of thee.” I asked, “And how
cometh it that the Commander of the Faithful trusteth her to go
out?” and she answered, “He loveth her with exceeding love
and is wrapped up in her and crosseth her not.” Then the slave-girl
went away, running after her mistress; whereupon I left the
shop and followed them, so I might see her abiding-place. I kept
them in view all the way, till she disappeared from mine eyes,
when I returned to my place, with heart a-fire. Some days after,
she came to me again and bought stuffs of me: I refused to take
the price and she cried, “We have no need of thy goods.” Quoth
I, “O my lady, accept them from me as a gift;” but quoth she,
“Wait till I try thee and make proof of thee.” Then she brought
out of her pocket a purse and gave me therefrom a thousand
dinars, saying, “Trade with this till I return to thee.” So I took
the purse and she went away and returned not till six months
had passed. Meanwhile, I traded with the money and sold
and bought and made other thousand dinars profit on it. At
last she came to me again and I said to her, “Here is thy money
and I have gained with it other thousand ducats;” and she,
“Let it lie by thee and take these other thousand dinars. As
soon as I have departed from thee, go thou to Al-Rauzah, the
Garden-holm, and build there a goodly pavilion, and when the
edifice is accomplished, give me to know thereof.” So saying,
she left me and went away. As soon as she was gone, I betook
myself to Al-Rauzah and fell to building the pavilion, and when
it was finished, I furnished it with the finest of furniture and
sent to tell her that I had made an end of the edifice; whereupon
she sent back to me, saying, “Let him meet me to-morrow
about daybreak at the Zuwaylah gate and bring with him a strong
ass.” I did as she bade and, betaking myself to the Zuwaylah
gate, at the appointed time, found there a young man on horseback,
awaiting her, even as I awaited her. As we stood, behold,
up she came, and with her a slave-girl. When she saw that
young man, she asked him, “Art thou here?” and he answered,
“Yes, O my lady.” Quoth she, “To-day I am invited by this
man: wilt thou wend with us?” and quoth he, “Yes.” Then
said she, “Thou hast brought me hither against my will and
parforce. Wilt thou go with us in any case?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6102" id="noteref-6102" epub:type="noteref">6102</a> He cried,
“Yes, yes,” and we fared on, all three, till we came to Al-Rauzah
and entered the pavilion. The dame diverted herself awhile
with viewing its ordinance and furniture, after which she doffed
her walking-dress and sat down with the young man in the
goodliest and chiefest place. Then I fared forth and brought
them what they should eat at the first of the day; presently I
again went out and fetched them what they should eat at the last
of the day and brought for the twain wine and dessert and
fruits and flowers. After this fashion I abode in their service,
standing on my feet, and she said not unto me, “Sit,” nor
“Take, eat,” nor “Take, drink,” while she and the young man
sat toying and laughing, and he fell to kissing her and pinching
her and hopping over the ground<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6103" id="noteref-6103" epub:type="noteref">6103</a> and laughing. They remained
thus awhile and presently she said, “Hitherto we have not
become drunken; let me pour out.” So she took the cup, and
crowning it, gave him to drink and plied him with wine, till
he lost his wits, when she took him up and carried him into a
closet. Then she came out, with the head of that youth in her
hand, while I stood silent, fixing not mine eyes on her eyes
neither questioning her of the case; and she asked me, “What
be this?” “I wot not,” answered I; and she said, “Take it
and throw it into the river.” I accepted her commandment and
she arose and stripping herself of her clothes, took a knife
and cut the dead man’s body in pieces, which she laid in three
baskets, and said to me, “Throw them into the river.” I did her
bidding and when I returned, she said to me, “Sit, so I may
relate to thee yonder fellow’s case, lest thou be affrighted at
what accident hath befallen him. Thou must know that I am
the Caliph’s favourite concubine, nor is there any higher in honour
with him than I; and I am allowed six nights in each month,
wherein I go down into the city and tarry with my whilome
mistress who reared me; and when I go down thus, I dispose
of myself as I will. Now this young man was the son of certain
neighbours of my mistress, when I was a virgin girl. One day,
my mistress was sitting with the chief officers of the palace and I
was alone in the house, and as the night came on, I went up
to the terrace-roof in order to sleep there, but ere I was ware,
this youth came up from the street and falling upon me knelt on
my breast. He was armed with a dagger and I could not get
free of him till he had taken my maidenhead by force; and this
sufficed him not, but he must needs disgrace me with all the
folk for, as often as I came down from the palace, he would stand
in wait for me by the way and futtered me against my will and
follow me whithersoever I went. This, then, is my story,
and as for thee, thou pleasest me and thy patience pleaseth me
and thy good faith and loyal service, and there abideth with
me none dearer than thou.” Then I lay with her that night
and there befel what befel between us till the morning, when
she gave me abundant wealth and took to meeting me at the
pavilion six days in every month. After this wise we passed
a whole year, at the end of which she cut herself off from
me a month’s space, wherefore fire raged in my heart on her
account. When it was the next month, behold, a little eunuch
presented himself to me and said, “I am a messenger to thee
from Such-an-one, who giveth thee to know that the Commander
of the Faithful hath ordered her to be drowned, her and those
who are with her, six-and-twenty slave-girls, on such a day at
Dayr al-Tin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6104" id="noteref-6104" epub:type="noteref">6104</a> for that they have confessed of lewdness, one
against other and she sayeth to thee, Look how thou mayst do
with me and how thou mayst contrive to deliver me, even an
thou gather together all my money and spend it upon me, for
that this be the time of manhood.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6105" id="noteref-6105" epub:type="noteref">6105</a> Quoth I, “I know not this
woman; belike it is other than I to whom this message is sent;
so beware, O Eunuch, lest thou cast me into a cleft.” Quoth he,
“Behold, I have told thee that I had to say,” and went away,
leaving me in sore concern on her account. Now when the
appointed day came, I arose and changing my clothes and
favour, donned sailor’s apparel; then I took with me a purse
full of gold and buying a right good breakfast, accosted a boatman
at Dayr al-Tin and sat down and ate with him; after which
I asked him, “Wilt thou hire me thy boat?” Answered he,
“The Commander of the Faithful hath commanded me to be
here;” and he told me the tale of the concubines and how the
Caliph purposed to drown them that day. When I heard this
from him, I brought out to him ten gold pieces and discovered
to him my case, whereupon he said to me, “O my brother, get
thee empty gourds, and when thy mistress cometh, give me
to know of her and I will contrive the trick.” So I kissed
his hand and thanked him and, as I was walking about, waiting,
up came the guards and eunuchs escorting the women, who were
weeping and shrieking and farewelling one another. The Castratos
cried out to us, whereupon we came with the boat, and they said
to the sailor, “Who be this?” Said he, “This be my mate
whom I have brought to help me, so one of us may keep the
boat, whilst another doth your service.” Then they brought
out to us the women, one by one, saying, “Throw them in by the
Island;” and we replied, “’Tis well.” Now each of them was
shackled and they had made fast about her neck a jar of sand.
We did as the neutrals bade us and ceased not to take the women,
one after other, and cast them in, till they gave us my mistress
and I winked to my mate. So we took her and carried her
out into mid-stream, where I threw to her the empty gourds<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6106" id="noteref-6106" epub:type="noteref">6106</a> and
said to her, “Wait for me at the mouth of the Canal.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6107" id="noteref-6107" epub:type="noteref">6107</a> Then
we cast her in alongside the boat, after we had loosed the jar of
sand from her legs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6108" id="noteref-6108" epub:type="noteref">6108</a> and done off her shackles, and returned.
Now there remained one woman after her: so we took her
and drowned her and the eunuchs went away, whilst we dropped
down the river with the craft till we came to the mouth of
Khalij, where I saw my mistress awaiting me. We haled her
up into the canoe and returned to our pavilion on Al-Rauzah.
Then I rewarded the sailor and he took his boat and went away;
whereupon quoth she to me, “Thou art indeed the friend ever
faithful found for the shifts of Fortune.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6109" id="noteref-6109" epub:type="noteref">6109</a> And I sojourned with
her some days; but the shock wrought upon her so that she
sickened and fell to wasting away and redoubled in languor and
weakness till she died. I mourned for her with exceeding
mourning and buried her; after which I removed all that was
in the pavilion to my own house and abandoned the building.
Now she had brought to that pavilion a little coffer of copper
and laid it in a place whereof I knew not; so, when the Inspector of
Inheritances<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6110" id="noteref-6110" epub:type="noteref">6110</a> came, he rummaged the house and found the coffer,
with the key in the lock. Presently he opened it and seeing
it full of jewels and jacinths and earrings and seal-rings and
precious stones (and ’twas a matter such as is not found save with
kings and sultans), took it, and me with it, and he and his men
ceased not to put me to the question with beating and torment
till I confessed to them the whole affair, from beginning to end.
Thereupon they carried me to the Caliph and I told him all that
had passed between me and her; and he said to me, “O man,
depart this city, for I release thee on account of thy courage and
because of thy constancy in keeping thy secret and thy daring in
exposing thyself to death.” So I arose forthwith and fared from
his city; and this is what befel me.</p>
