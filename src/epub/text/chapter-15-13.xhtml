			<h2 epub:type="title">The Whorish Wife Who Vaunted Her Virtue</h2>

<p>It is related that once upon a time there was a man which was an
astronomer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7496" id="noteref-7496" epub:type="noteref">7496</a> and he had a wife who was singular in beauty and
loveliness. Now she was ever and aye boasting and saying to
him, “O man, there is not amongst womankind my peer in
nobility<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7497" id="noteref-7497" epub:type="noteref">7497</a> and chastity;” and as often as she repeated this saying
to him he would give credit to her words and cry, “Walláhi, no
man hath a wife like unto the lady my wife for high caste and
continence!” Now he was ever singing her praises in every
assembly; but one day of the days as he was sitting in a séance of
the great, who all were saying their says anent womankind and
feminine deeds and misdeeds, the man rose up and exclaimed,
“Amongst women there is none like my wife, for that she is pure
of blood and behaviour;” hereat one of those present said to
him, “Thou liest, O certain person!”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that while the man
was singing the praises of his spouse one of those present rose
and said to him, “Walláhi, thou liest, O certain person!”
“Wherein do I lie?” quoth he, and quoth the other, “I will teach
thee and show thee manifestly whether thy wife be a lady or a
whore. Do thou rise up from amongst us and hie thee home and
go thou in to her and say:—O Woman, I am intent upon travelling
to a certain place and being absent for a matter of four days and
after will return; so do thou arise, O Woman, and bring me some
bread and a mould of cheese by way of viaticum. Then go thou
forth from beside her and disappear for a while; and presently
returning home hide thee in a private place without uttering a
word.” Cried those present, “By Allah, indeed these words may
not be blamed.” Accordingly, the man went forth from them
and fared till he entered his house where he said, “O Woman,
bring me something of provision for a journey: my design is to
travel and to be absent for a space of four days or haply six.”
Cried the wife, “O my lord, Thou art about to desolate me nor
can I on any wise bear parting from thee; and if thou needs must
journey do thou take me with thee.” Now when the man heard
these the words of his wife he said to himself, “By Allah, there cannot
be the fellow of my spouse amongst the sum of womankind,”
presently adding to her, “I shall be away from four to six days
but do thou keep watch and ward upon thyself and open not my
door to anyone at all.” Quoth she, “O Man, how canst thou quit
me?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7498" id="noteref-7498" epub:type="noteref">7498</a> and indeed I cannot suffer such separation.” Quoth he, “I
shall not long be separated from thee;” and so saying he fared
forth from her and disappeared for the space of an hour, after
which he returned home softly walking and hid himself in a place
where none could see him. Now after the space of two hours
behold, a Costermonger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7499" id="noteref-7499" epub:type="noteref">7499</a> came into the house and she met him
and salam’d to him and said, “What hast thou brought for me?”
“Two lengths of sugar-cane,” said he, and said she, “Set them
down in a corner of the room.” Then he asked her, “Whither
is thy husband gone?” and she answered, “On a journey: may
Allah never bring him back nor write his name among the
saved and our Lord deliver me from him as soon as possible!”
After this she embraced him and he embraced her and she kissed
him and he kissed her and enjoyed her favours till such time as he
had his will of her; after which he went his ways. When an hour
had passed a Poulterer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7500" id="noteref-7500" epub:type="noteref">7500</a> came to the house, whereupon she arose
and salam’d to him and said, “What hast thou brought me?”
He answered, “A pair of pigeon-poults;” so she cried, “Place
them under yon vessel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7501" id="noteref-7501" epub:type="noteref">7501</a>” Then the man went up to the woman
and he embraced her and she embraced him and he tumbled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7502" id="noteref-7502" epub:type="noteref">7502</a> her
and she tumbled him; after which he had his will of her and
presently he went off about his own business. When two hours or
so had gone by there came to her another man which was a
Gardener;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7503" id="noteref-7503" epub:type="noteref">7503</a> so she arose and met him with a meeting still fairer
than the first two and asked him, “What hast thou brought with
thee?” “A somewhat of pomegranates,” answered he; so she
took them from him and led him to a secret place where she left
him and changed her dress and adorned herself and perfumed
herself and Kohl’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7504" id="noteref-7504" epub:type="noteref">7504</a> her eyes. After that she returned to the
pomegranate-man and fell a-toying with him and he toyed with
her and she hugged him and he hugged her and at last he rogered
and had his wicked will of her and went his ways. Hereupon the
woman doffed her sumptuous dress and garbed herself in her everyday
garment. All this and the husband was looking on through
the chinks of the door behind which he was lurking and listening
to whatso befel, and when all was ended he went forth softly and
waited awhile and anon returned home. Hereupon the wife arose
and her glance falling upon her husband she noted him and accosted
him and salam’d to him and said, “Hast thou not been absent at all?”
Said he, “O Woman, there befel me a tale on the way which may
not be written on any wise, save with foul water upon disks of dung,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7505" id="noteref-7505" epub:type="noteref">7505</a>
and indeed I have endured sore toil and travel, and had not Allah
(be He praised and exalted!) saved me therefrom, I had never
returned.” Quoth his wife, “What hath befallen thee?”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent,
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night?” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the wife asked
the husband saying, “What hath befallen thee on thy way?”
And he answered, “O Woman, when I went forth the town and
took the road, behold, a basilisk issued from his den and coming
to the highway stretched himself therealong, so I was unable to
step a single footstep; and indeed, O Woman, his length was that
of yon sugar cane, brought by the Costermonger and which thou
placedst in the corner. Also he had hair upon his head like
the feathers of the pigeon-poults presented to thee by the
Poulterer-man, and which thou hast set under the vessel; and
lastly, O Woman, his head was like the pomegranates which thou
tookest from the Market Gardener<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7506" id="noteref-7506" epub:type="noteref">7506</a> and carriedst within the house.”
Whenas the wife heard these words, she lost command of herself
and her right senses went wrong and she became purblind and
deaf, neither seeing nor hearing, because she was certified that her
spouse had sighted and eye-witnessed what she had wrought of
waywardness and frowardness. Then the man continued to her,
“O Whore! O Fornicatress, O Adulteress. How durst thou say to
me, ’There is not amongst womankind my better in nobility
and purity?’ and this day I have beheld with my own eyes
what thy chastity may be. So do thou take thy belongings
and go forth from me and be off with thyself to thine own
folk.” And so saying he divorced her with the triple divorce and
thrust her forth the house. Now when the Emir heard the afore-told
tale from his neighbour, he rejoiced therein; this being was a
notable wile of the guiles of womankind which they are wont to
work with man for “Verily great is their craft.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7507" id="noteref-7507" epub:type="noteref">7507</a> And presently
he dismissed the fourth lover, his neighbour, even as he had freed
the other three, and never again did such trouble befal him and
his wife, or from Kazi or from any other.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7508" id="noteref-7508" epub:type="noteref">7508</a> And to the same purport
(quoth Shahrazad), to wit, the slights and snares of the sex,
they also tell the tale of</p>
