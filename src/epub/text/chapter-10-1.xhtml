<h2 epub:type="title">Ma’aruf the Cobbler and His Wife Fatimah</h2>


<p>There dwelt once upon a time in the God-guarded city of Cairo
a cobbler who lived by patching old shoes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4591" id="noteref-4591" epub:type="noteref">4591</a> His name was
Ma’aruf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4592" id="noteref-4592" epub:type="noteref">4592</a> and he had a wife called Fatimah, whom the folk had
nicknamed “The Dung;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4593" id="noteref-4593" epub:type="noteref">4593</a> for that she was a whorish, worthless
wretch, scanty of shame and mickle of mischief. She ruled her
spouse and used to abuse him and curse him a thousand times a
day; and he feared her malice and dreaded her misdoings; for
that he was a sensible man and careful of his repute, but poor-conditioned.
When he earned much, he spent it on her, and
when he gained little, she revenged herself on his body that night,
leaving him no peace and making his night black as her book;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4594" id="noteref-4594" epub:type="noteref">4594</a>
for she was even as of one like her saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How manifold nights have I passed with my wife ✿ In the saddest plight with all misery rife:</div>
      <div class="line">Would Heaven when first I went in to her ✿ With a cup of cold poison I’d ta’en her life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Amongst other afflictions which befel him from her one day she
said to him, “O Ma’aruf, I wish thee to bring me this night a
vermicelli-cake dressed with bees’ honey.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4595" id="noteref-4595" epub:type="noteref">4595</a> He replied, “So Allah
Almighty aid me to its price, I will bring it thee. By Allah, I
have no dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4596" id="noteref-4596" epub:type="noteref">4596</a>
Rejoined she,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
Ma’aruf the Cobbler said to his spouse, “If Allah aid me to its
price, I will bring it to thee this night. By Allah, I have no
dirhams to-day, but our Lord will make things easy to me!” She
rejoined, “I wot naught of these words; whether He aid thee or
aid thee not, look thou come not to me save with the vermicelli
and bees’ honey; and if thou come without it I will make thy
night black as thy fortune whenas thou marriedst me and fellest
into my hand.” Quoth he, “Allah is bountiful!” and going out
with grief scattering itself from his body, prayed the dawn-prayer
and opened his shop, saying, “I beseech thee, O Lord, to vouchsafe
me the price of the Kunafah and ward off from me the mischief of
yonder wicked woman this night!” After which he sat in the
shop till noon, but no work came to him and his fear of his wife
redoubled. Then he arose and locking his shop, went out perplexed
as to how he should do in the matter of the vermicelli-cake,
seeing he had not even the wherewithal to buy bread. Presently
he came up to the shop of the Kunafah-seller and stood before it
distraught, whilst his eyes brimmed with tears. The pastry-cook
glanced at him and said, “O Master Ma’aruf, why dost thou weep?
Tell me what hath befallen thee.” So he acquainted him with his
case, saying, “My wife is a shrew, a virago who would have me
bring her a Kunafah; but I have sat in my shop till past
mid-day and have not gained even the price of bread; wherefore
I am in fear of her.” The cook laughed and said, “No harm shall
come to thee. How many pounds wilt thou have?” “Five
pounds,” answered Ma’aruf. So the man weighed him out five
pounds of vermicelli-cake and said to him, “I have clarified butter,
but no bees’ honey. Here is drip-honey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4597" id="noteref-4597" epub:type="noteref">4597</a> however, which is better
than bees’ honey; and what harm will there be, if it be with drip-honey?”
Ma’aruf was ashamed to object, because the pastry-cook
was to have patience with him for the price, and said, “Give
it me with drip-honey.” So he fried a vermicelli-cake for him with
butter and drenched it with drip-honey, till it was fit to present to
Kings. Then he asked him, “Dost thou want bread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4598" id="noteref-4598" epub:type="noteref">4598</a> and
cheese?”; and Ma’aruf answered, “Yes.” So he gave him four
half dirhams worth of bread and one of cheese, and the vermicelli
was ten nusfs. Then said he, “Know, O Ma’aruf, that thou owest
me fifteen nusfs; so go to thy wife and make merry and take this
nusf for the Hammam;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4599" id="noteref-4599" epub:type="noteref">4599</a> and thou shalt have credit for a day or
two or three till Allah provide thee with thy daily bread. And
straiten not thy wife, for I will have patience with thee till such
time as thou shalt have dirhams to spare.” So Ma’aruf took the
vermicelli-cake and bread and cheese and went away, with a
heart at ease, blessing the pastry-cook and saying, “Extolled be
Thy perfection, O my Lord! How bountiful art Thou!” When
he came home, his wife enquired of him, “Hast thou brought the
vermicelli-cake?”; and, replying “Yes,” he set it before her.
She looked at it and seeing that it was dressed with cane-honey,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4600" id="noteref-4600" epub:type="noteref">4600</a>
said to him, “Did I not bid thee bring it with bees’ honey? Wilt
thou contrary my wish and have it dressed with cane-honey?”
He excused himself to her, saying, “I bought it not save on credit;”
but said she, “This talk is idle; I will not eat Kunafah save with
bees’ honey.” And she was wroth with it and threw it in his face,
saying, “Begone, thou pimp, and bring me other than this!”
Then she dealt him a buffet on the cheek and knocked out one of
his teeth. The blood ran down upon his breast and for stress of
anger he smote her on the head a single blow and a slight;
whereupon she clutched his beard and fell to shouting out and
saying, “Help, O Moslems!” So the neighbours came in and
freed his beard from her grip; then they reproved and reproached
her, saying, “We are all content to eat Kunafah with cane-honey.
Why, then, wilt thou oppress this poor man thus? Verily, this is
disgraceful in thee!” And they went on to soothe her till they
made peace between her and him. But, when the folk were gone,
she sware that she would not eat of the vermicelli, and Ma’aruf,
burning with hunger, said in himself, “She sweareth that she will
not eat; so I will e’en eat.” Then he ate, and when she saw
him eating, she said, “Inshallah, may the eating of it be poison
to destroy the far one’s body.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4601" id="noteref-4601" epub:type="noteref">4601</a> Quoth he, “It shall not be
at thy bidding,” and went on eating, laughing and saying,
“Thou swarest that thou wouldst not eat of this; but Allah is
bountiful, and to-morrow night, an the Lord decree, I will
bring thee Kunafah dressed with bees’ honey, and thou shalt eat it
alone.” And he applied himself to appeasing her, whilst she
called down curses upon him; and she ceased not to rail at him
and revile him with gross abuse till the morning, when she bared
her forearm to beat him. Quoth he, “Give me time and I will
bring thee other vermicelli-cake.” Then he went out to the
mosque and prayed, after which he betook himself to his shop and
opening it, sat down; but hardly had he done this when up came
two runners from the Kazi’s court and said to him, “Up with thee,
speak with the Kazi, for thy wife hath complained of thee to him
and her favour is thus and thus.” He recognised her by their
description; and saying, “May Allah Almighty torment her!”
walked with them till he came to the Kazi’s presence, where he
found Fatimah standing with her arm bound up and her face-veil
besmeared with blood; and she was weeping and wiping away her
tears. Quoth the Kazi, “Ho man, hast thou no fear of Allah the
Most High? Why hast thou beaten this good woman and broken
her forearm and knocked out her tooth and entreated her thus?”
And quoth Ma’aruf, “If I beat her or put out her tooth, sentence
me to what thou wilt; but in truth the case was thus and thus and
the neighbours made peace between me and her.” And he told
him the story from first to last. Now this Kazi was a benevolent
man; so he brought out to him a quarter dinar, saying, “O man,
take this and get her Kunafah with bees’ honey and do ye make
peace, thou and she.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “Give it to her.” So she
took it and the Kazi made peace between them, saying, “O wife,
obey thy husband; and thou, O man, deal kindly with her.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4602" id="noteref-4602" epub:type="noteref">4602</a>”
Then they left the court, reconciled at the Kazi’s hands, and the
woman went one way, whilst her husband returned by another way
to his shop and sat there, when, behold, the runners came up to
him and said, “Give us our fee.” Quoth he, “The Kazi took not
of me aught; on the contrary, he gave me a quarter dinar.” But
quoth they, “’Tis no concern of ours whether the Kazi took of
thee or gave to thee, and if thou give us not our fee, we will exact
it in despite of thee.” And they fell to dragging him about the
market; so he sold his tools and gave them half a dinar, whereupon
they let him go and went away, whilst he put his hand to his cheek
and sat sorrowful, for that he had no tools wherewith to work.
Presently, up came two ill-favoured fellows and said to him,
“Come, O man, and speak with the Kazi; for thy wife hath complained
of thee to him.” Said he, “He made peace between us
just now.” But said they, “We come from another Kazi, and thy
wife hath complained of thee to our Kazi.” So he arose and went
with them to their Kazi, calling on Allah for aid against her; and
when he saw her, he said to her, “Did we not make peace, good
woman?” Whereupon she cried, “There abideth no peace between
me and thee.” Accordingly he came forward and told the
Kazi his story, adding, “And indeed the Kazi Such-an-one made
peace between us this very hour.” Whereupon the Kazi said to
her, “O strumpet, since ye two have made peace with each other,
why comest thou to me complaining?” Quoth she, “He beat me
after that;” but quoth the Kazi, “Make peace each with other,
and beat her not again, and she will cross thee no more.” So they
made peace and the Kazi said to Ma’aruf, “Give the runners their
fee.” So he gave them their fee and going back to his shop,
opened it and sat down, as he were a drunken man for excess of
the chagrin which befel him. Presently, while he was still sitting,
behold, a man came up to him and said, “O Ma’aruf, rise and
hide thyself, for thy wife hath complained of thee to the High
Court<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4603" id="noteref-4603" epub:type="noteref">4603</a> and Abú Tabak<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4604" id="noteref-4604" epub:type="noteref">4604</a> is after thee.” So he shut his shop and
fled towards the Gate of Victory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4605" id="noteref-4605" epub:type="noteref">4605</a> He had five Nusfs of silver
left of the price of the lasts and gear; and therewith he bought
four worth of bread and one of cheese, as he fled from her. Now
it was the winter season and the hour of mid-afternoon prayer; so,
when he came out among the rubbish-mounds the rain descended
upon him, like water from the mouths of water-skins, and his
clothes were drenched. He therefore entered the ‘Ádiliyah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4606" id="noteref-4606" epub:type="noteref">4606</a>
where he saw a ruined place and therein a deserted cell without a
door; and in it he took refuge and found shelter from the rain.
The tears streamed from his eyelids, and he fell to complaining of
what had betided him and saying, “Whither shall I flee from this
whore? I beseech Thee, O Lord, to vouchsafe me one who shall
conduct me to a far country, where she shall not know the way to
me!” Now while he sat weeping, behold, the wall clave and
there came forth to him therefrom one of tall stature, whose aspect
caused his body-pile to bristle and his flesh to creep, and said to
him, “O man, what aileth thee that thou disturbest me this night?
These two hundred years have I dwelt here and have never seen
any enter this place and do as thou dost. Tell me what thou
wishest and I will accomplish thy need, as ruth for thee hath got
hold upon my heart”. Quoth Ma’aruf, “Who and what art
thou?”; and quoth he, “I am the Haunter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4607" id="noteref-4607" epub:type="noteref">4607</a> of this place.” So
Ma’aruf told him all that had befallen him with his wife and he
said, “Wilt thou have me convey thee to a country, where thy
wife shall know no way to thee?” “Yes,” said Ma’aruf; and the
other, “Then mount my back.” So he mounted on his back and
he flew with him from after supper-tide till daybreak, when he set
him down on the top of a high mountain——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Marid
having taken up Ma’aruf the Cobbler, flew off with him and set him
down upon a high mountain and said to him, “O mortal, descend
this mountain and thou wilt see the gate of a city. Enter it, for
therein thy wife cannot come at thee.” He then left him and went
his way, whilst Ma’aruf abode in amazement and perplexity till the
sun rose, when he said to himself, “I will up with me and go down
into the city: indeed there is no profit in my abiding upon this
highland.” So he descended to the mountain-foot and saw a city
girt by towering walls, full of lofty palaces and gold-adorned buildings
which was a delight to beholders. He entered in at the gate
and found it a place such as lightened the grieving heart; but, as
he walked through the streets the townsfolk stared at him as a
curiosity and gathered about him, marvelling at his dress, for it
was unlike theirs. Presently, one of them said to him, “O man,
art thou a stranger?” “Yes.” “What countryman art thou?”
“I am from the city of Cairo the Auspicious.” “And when didst
thou leave Cairo?” “I left it yesterday, at the hour of afternoon-prayer.”
Whereupon the man laughed at him and cried out,
saying, “Come look, O folk, at this man and hear what he saith!”
Quoth they, “What doeth he say?” and quoth the townsman,
“He pretendeth that he cometh from Cairo and left it yesterday
at the hour of afternoon-prayer!” At this they all laughed and
gathering round Ma’aruf, said to him, “O man, art thou mad to
talk thus? How canst thou pretend that thou leftest Cairo at
mid-afternoon yesterday and foundedst thyself this morning here,
when the truth is that between our city and Cairo lieth a full
year’s journey?” Quoth he, “None is mad but you. As for me,
I speak sooth, for here is bread which I brought with me from
Cairo, and see, ’tis yet new.” Then he showed them the bread
and they stared at it, for it was unlike their country bread. So
the crowd increased about him and they said to one another,
“This is Cairo bread: look at it;” and he became a gazing-stock
in the city and some believed him; whilst others gave him
the lie and made mock of him. Whilst this was going on, behold,
up came a merchant riding on a she-mule and followed by two
black slaves, and brake a way through the people, saying, “O
folk, are ye not ashamed to mob this stranger and make mock of
him and scoff at him?” And he went on to rate them, till he
drave them away from Ma’aruf, and none could make him any
answer. Then he said to the stranger, “Come, O my brother,
no harm shall betide thee from these folk. Verily they have no
shame.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4608" id="noteref-4608" epub:type="noteref">4608</a> So he took him and carrying him to a spacious and
richly-adorned house, seated him in a speak-room fit for a King,
whilst he gave an order to his slaves, who opened a chest and
brought out to him a dress such as might be worn by a merchant
worth a thousand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4609" id="noteref-4609" epub:type="noteref">4609</a> He clad him therewith and Ma’aruf, being a
seemly man, became as he were consul of the merchants. Then
his host called for food and they set before them a tray of all
manner exquisite viands. The twain ate and drank and the
merchant said to Ma’aruf, “O my brother, what is thy name?”
“My name is Ma’aruf and I am a cobbler by trade and patch old
shoes.” “What countryman art thou?” “I am from Cairo.”
“What quarter?” “Dost thou know Cairo?” “I am of its
children.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4610" id="noteref-4610" epub:type="noteref">4610</a>” “I come from the Red Street.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4611" id="noteref-4611" epub:type="noteref">4611</a>” “And whom dost
thou know in the Red Street?” “I know such an one and such
an one,” answered Ma’aruf and named several people to him.
Quoth the other, “Knowest thou Shaykh Ahmad the druggist?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4612" id="noteref-4612" epub:type="noteref">4612</a>”
“He was my next neighbour, wall to wall.” “Is he well?”
“Yes.” “How many sons hath he?” “Three, Mustafà,
Mohammed and Ali.” “And what hath Allah done with
them?” “As for Mustafà, he is well and he is a learned man, a
professor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4613" id="noteref-4613" epub:type="noteref">4613</a>: Mohammed is a druggist and opened him a shop
beside that of his father, after he had married, and his wife hath
borne him a son named Hasan.” “Allah gladden thee with good
news!” said the merchant; and Ma’aruf continued, “As for
Ali, he was my friend, when we were boys, and we always
played together, I and he. We used to go in the guise of the
children of the Nazarenes and enter the church and steal the
books of the Christians and sell them and buy food with the
price. It chanced once that the Nazarenes caught us with a
book; whereupon they complained of us to our folk and said to
Ali’s father:—An thou hinder not thy son from troubling us, we
will complain of thee to the King. So he appeased them and
gave Ali a thrashing; wherefore he ran away none knew whither
and he hath now been absent twenty years and no man hath
brought news of him.” Quoth the host, “I am that very Ali, son
of Shaykh Ahmad the druggist, and thou art my playmate
Ma’aruf.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4614" id="noteref-4614" epub:type="noteref">4614</a> So they saluted each other and after the salam Ali
said, “Tell me why, O Ma’aruf, thou camest from Cairo to this
city.” Then he told him all that had befallen him of ill-doing
with his wife Fatimah the Dung and said, “So, when her annoy
waxed on me, I fled from her towards the Gate of Victory and
went forth the city. Presently, the rain fell heavy on me; so I
entered a ruined cell in the Adiliyah and sat there, weeping;
whereupon there came forth to me the Haunter of the place,
which was an Ifrit of the Jinn, and questioned me. I acquainted
him with my case and he took me on his back and flew with me
all night between heaven and earth, till he set me down on yonder
mountain and gave me to know of this city. So I came down
from the mountain and entered the city, when the people crowded
about me and questioned me. I told them that I had left Cairo
yesterday, but they believed me not, and presently thou camest up
and driving the folk away from me, carriedst me to this house. Such,
then, is the cause of my quitting Cairo; and thou, what object
brought thee hither?” Quoth Ali, “The giddiness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4615" id="noteref-4615" epub:type="noteref">4615</a> of folly
turned my head when I was seven years old, from which time I
wandered from land to land and city to city, till I came to this
city, the name whereof is Ikhtiyán al-Khatan.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4616" id="noteref-4616" epub:type="noteref">4616</a> I found its people
an hospitable folk and a kindly, compassionate for the poor man
and selling to him on credit and believing all he said. So quoth
I to them:—I am a merchant and have preceded my packs and I
need a place wherein to bestow my baggage. And they believed
me and assigned me a lodging. Then quoth I to them:—Is there
any of you will lend me a thousand dinars, till my loads arrive,
when I will repay it to him; for I am in want of certain things
before my goods come? They gave me what I asked and I went
to the merchants’ bazar, where, seeing goods, I bought them and
sold them next day at a profit of fifty gold pieces and bought
others.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4617" id="noteref-4617" epub:type="noteref">4617</a> And I consorted with the folk and entreated them liberally,
so that they loved me, and I continued to sell and buy, till I grew
rich. Know, O my brother, that the proverb saith, The world is
show and trickery: and the land where none wotteth thee, there
do whatso liketh thee. Thou too, an thou say to all who ask
thee, I’m a cobbler by trade and poor withal, and I fled
from my wife and left Cairo yesterday, they will not believe thee
and thou wilt be a laughing-stock among them as long as thou
abidest in the city; whilst, an thou tell them, An Ifrit brought me
hither, they will take fright at thee and none will come near thee;
for they will say, This man is possessed of an Ifrit and harm will
betide whoso approacheth him. And such public report will be
dishonouring both to thee and to me, because they ken I come
from Cairo.” Ma’aruf asked:—“How then shall I do?”; and Ali
answered, “I will tell thee how thou shalt do, Inshallah! To-morrow
I will give thee a thousand dinars and a she-mule to ride
and a black slave, who shall walk before thee and guide thee to
the gate of the merchants’ bazar; and do thou go into them. I
will be there sitting amongst them, and when I see thee, I will
rise to thee and salute thee with the salam and kiss thy hand and
make a great man of thee. Whenever I ask thee of any kind of
stuff, saying, Hast thou brought with thee aught of such a kind?
do thou answer, “Plenty.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4618" id="noteref-4618" epub:type="noteref">4618</a>” And if they question me of thee, I
will praise thee and magnify thee in their eyes and say to them,
Get him a store-house and a shop. I also will give thee out for a
man of great wealth and generosity; and if a beggar come to thee,
bestow upon him what thou mayst; so will they put faith in what
I say and believe in thy greatness and generosity and love thee.
Then will I invite thee to my house and invite all the merchants
on thy account and bring together thee and them, so that all may
know thee and thou know them,”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
merchant Ali said to Ma’aruf, “I will invite thee to my house and
invite all the merchants on thy account and bring together thee and
them, so that all may know thee and thou know them, whereby
thou shalt sell and buy and take and give with them; nor will it
be long ere thou become a man of money.” Accordingly, on the
morrow he gave him a thousand dinars and a suit of clothes and a
black slave and mounting him on a she-mule, said to him, “Allah
give thee quittance of responsibility for all this,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4619" id="noteref-4619" epub:type="noteref">4619</a> inasmuch as thou
art my friend and it behoveth me to deal generously with thee.
Have no care; but put away from thee the thought of thy wife’s
misways and name her not to any.” “Allah requite thee with
good!” replied Ma’aruf and rode on, preceded by his blackamoor
till the slave brought him to the gate of the merchants’ bazar,
where they were all seated, and amongst them Ali, who when he
saw him, rose and threw himself upon him, crying, “A blessed
day, O Merchant Ma’aruf, O man of good works and kindness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4620" id="noteref-4620" epub:type="noteref">4620</a>!”
And he kissed his hand before the merchants and said to them,
“Our brothers, ye are honoured by knowing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4621" id="noteref-4621" epub:type="noteref">4621</a> the merchant
Ma’aruf.” So they saluted him, and Ali signed to them to make
much of him, wherefore he was magnified in their eyes. Then Ali
helped him to dismount from his she-mule and saluted him with
the salam; after which he took the merchants apart, one after
other, and vaunted Ma’aruf to them. They asked, “Is this man a
merchant?;” and he answered, “Yes; and indeed he is the chiefest
of merchants, there liveth not a wealthier than he; for his wealth
and the riches of his father and forefathers are famous among the
merchants of Cairo. He hath partners in Hind and Sind and Al-Yaman
and is high in repute for generosity. So know ye his
rank and exalt ye his degree and do him service, and wot also
that his coming to your city is not for the sake of traffic, and none
other save to divert himself with the sight of folk’s countries: indeed,
he hath no need of strangerhood for the sake of gain and
profit, having wealth that fires cannot consume, and I am one of
his servants.” And he ceased not to extol him, till they set him
above their heads and began to tell one another of his qualities.
Then they gathered round him and offered him junkets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4622" id="noteref-4622" epub:type="noteref">4622</a> and
sherbets, and even the Consul of the Merchants came to him and
saluted him; whilst Ali proceeded to ask him, in the presence of
the traders, “O my lord, haply thou hast brought with thee somewhat
of such and such a stuff?”; and Ma’aruf answered, “Plenty.”
Now Ali had that day shown him various kinds of costly clothes
and had taught him the names of the different stuffs, dear and
cheap. Then said one of the merchants, “O my lord, hast thou
brought with thee yellow broad cloth?”: and Ma’aruf said,
“Plenty”! Quoth another, “And gazelles’ blood red<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4623" id="noteref-4623" epub:type="noteref">4623</a>?”; and
quoth the Cobbler, “Plenty”; and as often as he asked him of
aught, he made him the same answer. So the other said, “O
Merchant Ali had thy countryman a mind to transport a thousand
loads of costly stuffs, he could do so”; and Ali said, “He would
take them from a single one of his store-houses, and miss naught
thereof.” Now whilst they were sitting, behold, up came a beggar
and went the round of the merchants. One gave him a half dirham
and another a copper,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4624" id="noteref-4624" epub:type="noteref">4624</a> but most of them gave him nothing, till he
came to Ma’aruf who pulled out a handful of gold and gave it to
him, whereupon he blessed him and went his ways. The merchants
marvelled at this and said, “Verily, this is a King’s bestowal for
he gave the beggar gold without count, and were he not a man
of vast wealth and money without end, he had not given a beggar
a handful of gold.” After a while, there came to him a poor
woman and he gave her a handful of gold; whereupon she went
away, blessing him, and told the other beggars, who came to him,
one after other, and he gave them each a handful of gold, till he
disbursed the thousand dinars. Then he struck hand upon hand
and said, “Allah is our sufficient aid and excellent is the Agent!”
Quoth the Consul, “What aileth thee, O Merchant Ma’aruf?”; and
quoth he, “It seemeth that the most part of the people of this city are
poor and needy; had I known their misery I would have brought
with me a large sum of money in my saddle-bags and given
largesse thereof to the poor. I fear me I may be long abroad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4625" id="noteref-4625" epub:type="noteref">4625</a>
and ’tis not in my nature to baulk a beggar; and I have no gold
left: so, if a pauper come to me, what shall I say to him?”
Quoth the Consul, “Say, Allah will send thee thy daily bread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4626" id="noteref-4626" epub:type="noteref">4626</a>!”;
but Ma’aruf replied, “That is not my practice and I am care-ridden
because of this. Would I had other thousand dinars, wherewith
to give alms till my baggage come!” “Have no care for that,”
quoth the Consul and sending one of his dependents for a thousand
dinars, handed them to Ma’aruf, who went on giving them to
every beggar who passed till the call to noon-prayer. Then they
entered the Cathedral-mosque and prayed the noon-prayers, and
what was left him of the thousand gold pieces he scattered on
the heads of the worshippers. This drew the people’s attention to
him and they blessed him, whilst the merchants marvelled at the
abundance of his generosity and openhandedness. Then he turned
to another trader and borrowing of him other thousand ducats,
gave these also away, whilst Merchant Ali looked on at what he
did, but could not speak. He ceased not to do thus till the call
to mid-afternoon prayer, when he entered the mosque and prayed
and distributed the rest of the money. On this wise, by the time
they locked the doors of the bazar,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4627" id="noteref-4627" epub:type="noteref">4627</a> he had borrowed five thousand
sequins and given them away, saying to every one of whom he
took aught, “Wait till my baggage come when, if thou desire gold
I will give thee gold, and if thou desire stuffs, thou shalt have
stuffs; for I have no end of them.” At eventide Merchant Ali
invited Ma’aruf and the rest of the traders to an entertainment
and seated him in the upper end, the place of honour, where he
talked of nothing but cloths and jewels, and whenever they made
mention to him of aught, he said, “I have plenty of it.” Next
day, he again repaired to the market-street where he showed a
friendly bias towards the merchants and borrowed of them more
money, which he distributed to the poor: nor did he leave doing
thus twenty days, till he had borrowed threescore thousand dinars,
and still there came no baggage, no, nor a burning plague.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4628" id="noteref-4628" epub:type="noteref">4628</a>
At last folk began to clamour for their money and say, “The
merchant Ma’aruf’s baggage cometh not. How long will he take
people’s monies and give them to the poor?” And quoth one of
them, “My rede is that we speak to Merchant Ali.” So they
went to him and said, “O Merchant Ali, Merchant Ma’aruf’s
baggage cometh not.” Said he, “Have patience, it cannot fail to
come soon.” Then he took Ma’aruf aside and said to him, “O
Ma’aruf, what fashion is this? Did I bid thee brown<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4629" id="noteref-4629" epub:type="noteref">4629</a> the bread
or burn it? The merchants clamour for their coin and tell me
that thou owest them sixty thousand dinars, which thou hast
borrowed and given away to the poor. How wilt thou satisfy the
folk, seeing that thou neither sellest nor buyest?” Said Ma’aruf,
“What matters it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4630" id="noteref-4630" epub:type="noteref">4630</a>; and what are threescore thousand dinars?
When my baggage shall come, I will pay them in stuffs or in gold
and silver, as they will.” Quoth Merchant Ali, “Allah is Most
Great! Hast thou then any baggage?” and he said, “Plenty.”
Cried the other, “Allah and the Hallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4631" id="noteref-4631" epub:type="noteref">4631</a> requite thee thine
impudence! Did I teach thee this saying, that thou shouldst
repeat it to me? But I will acquaint the folk with thee.”
Ma’aruf rejoined, “Begone and prate no more! Am I a poor
man? I have endless wealth in my baggage and as soon as it
cometh, they shall have their money’s worth, two for one. I have
no need of them.” At this Merchant Ali waxed wroth and said,
“Unmannerly wight that thou art, I will teach thee to lie to me
and be not ashamed!” Said Ma’aruf, “E’en work the worst thy
hand can do! They must wait till my baggage come, when they
shall have their due and more.” So Ali left him and went away,
saying in himself, “I praised him whilome and if I blame him
now, I make myself out a liar and become of those of whom it is
said:—Whoso praiseth and then blameth lieth twice.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4632" id="noteref-4632" epub:type="noteref">4632</a> And he
knew not what to do. Presently, the traders came to him and
said, “O Merchant Ali, hast thou spoken to him?” Said he, “O
folk, I am ashamed and, though he owe me a thousand dinars, I
cannot speak to him. When ye lent him your money ye consulted
me not; so ye have no claim on me. Dun him yourselves, and if
he pay you not, complain of him to the King of the city, saying:—He
is an impostor who hath imposed upon us. And he will
deliver you from the plague of him.” Accordingly, they repaired
to the King and told him what had passed, saying, “O King of
the age, we are perplexed anent this merchant, whose generosity
is excessive; for he doeth thus and thus, and all he borroweth, he
giveth away to the poor by handsful. Were he a man of naught,
his sense would not suffer him to lavish gold on this wise; and
were he a man of wealth, his good faith had been made manifest
to us by the coming of his baggage; but we see none of his
luggage, although he avoucheth that he hath a baggage-train and
hath preceded it. Now some time hath past, but there appeareth
no sign of his baggage-train, and he oweth us sixty thousand gold
pieces, all of which he hath given away in alms.” And they went
on to praise him and extol his generosity. Now this King was a
very covetous man, a more covetous than Ash’ab<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4633" id="noteref-4633" epub:type="noteref">4633</a>; and when he
heard tell of Ma’aruf’s generosity and openhandedness, greed of
gain got the better of him and he said to his Wazir, “Were not
this merchant a man of immense wealth, he had not shown all
this munificence. His baggage-train will assuredly come, whereupon
these merchants will flock to him and he will scatter amongst
them riches galore. Now I have more right to this money than
they; wherefore I have a mind to make friends with him and
profess affection for him, so that, when his baggage cometh whatso
the merchants would have had I shall get of him; and I will give
him my daughter to wife and join his wealth to my wealth.”
Replied the Wazir, “O King of the age, methinks he is naught
but an impostor, and ’tis the impostor who ruineth the house of
the covetous;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Wazir said to the King, “Methinks he is naught but an
impostor, and ’tis the impostor who ruineth the house of the
covetous;” the King said, “O Wazir, I will prove him and soon
know if he be an impostor or a true man and whether he be a
rearling of Fortune or not.” The Wazir asked, “And how wilt
thou prove him?”; and the King answered, “I will send for him
to the presence and entreat him with honour and give him a jewel
which I have. An he know it and wot its price, he is a man of
worth and wealth; but an he know it not, he is an impostor and
an upstart and I will do him die by the foulest fashion of deaths.”
So he sent for Ma’aruf, who came and saluted him. The King
returned his salam and seating him beside himself, said to him,
“Art thou the merchant Ma’aruf?” and said he, “Yes.” Quoth
the King, “The merchants declare that thou owest them sixty
thousand ducats. Is this true?” “Yes,” quoth he. Asked the
King, “Then why dost thou not give them their money?”; and
he answered, “Let them wait till my baggage come and I will repay
them twofold. An they wish for gold, they shall have gold; and
should they wish for silver, they shall have silver; or an they
prefer for merchandise, I will give them merchandise; and to whom
I owe a thousand I will give two thousand in requital of that
wherewith he hath veiled my face before the poor; for I have
plenty.” Then said the King, “O merchant, take this and look
what is its kind and value.” And he gave him a jewel the bigness
of a hazel-nut, which he had bought for a thousand sequins and
not having its fellow, prized it highly. Ma’aruf took it and pressing
it between his thumb and forefinger brake it, for it was brittle
and would not brook the squeeze. Quoth the King, “Why hast
thou broken the jewel?”; and Ma’aruf laughed and said, “O King
of the age, this is no jewel. This is but a bittock of mineral worth
a thousand dinars; why dost thou style it a jewel? A jewel I call
such as is worth threescore and ten thousand gold pieces and this
is called but a piece of stone. A jewel that is not of the bigness
of a walnut hath no worth in my eyes and I take no account
thereof. How cometh it, then, that thou, who art King, stylest
this thing a jewel, when ’tis but a bit of mineral worth a thousand
dinars? But ye are excusable, for that ye are poor folk and have
not in your possession things of price.” The King asked, “O
merchant, hast thou jewels such as those whereof thou speakest?”;
and he answered, “Plenty.” Whereupon avarice overcame the
King and he said, “Wilt thou give me real jewels?” Said
Ma’aruf, “When my baggage-train shall come, I will give thee no
end of jewels; and all that thou canst desire I have in plenty and
will give thee, without price.” At this the King rejoiced and said
to the traders, “Wend your ways and have patience with him, till
his baggage arrive, when do ye come to me and receive your
monies from me.” So they fared forth and the King turned to his
Wazir and said to him, “Pay court to Merchant Ma’aruf and take
and give with him in talk and bespeak him of my daughter,
Princess Dunyá, that he may wed her and so we gain these riches
he hath.” Said the Wazir, “O King of the age, this man’s
fashion misliketh me and methinks he is an impostor and a liar:
so leave this whereof thou speakest lest thou lose thy daughter for
naught.” Now this Minister had sued the King aforetime to give
him his daughter to wife and he was willing to do so, but when she
heard of it she consented not to marry him. Accordingly, the
King said to him, “O traitor, thou desirest no good for me, because
in past time thou soughtest my daughter in wedlock, but she would
none of thee; so now thou wouldst cut off the way of her marriage
and wouldst have the Princess lie fallow, that thou mayst take her;
but hear from me one word. Thou hast no concern in this matter.
How can he be an impostor and a liar, seeing that he knew the
price of the jewel, even that for which I bought it, and brake it
because it pleased him not? He hath jewels in plenty, and when
he goeth in to my daughter and seeth her to be beautiful, she will
captivate his reason and he will love her and give her jewels and
things of price: but, as for thee, thou wouldst forbid my daughter
and myself these good things.” So the Minister was silent, for
fear of the King’s anger, and said to himself, “Set the curs on the
cattle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4634" id="noteref-4634" epub:type="noteref">4634</a>!” Then with show of friendly bias he betook himself to
Ma’aruf and said to him, “His highness the King loveth thee and
hath a daughter, a winsome lady and a lovesome, to whom he is
minded to marry thee. What sayst thou?” Said he, “No harm
in that; but let him wait till my baggage come, for marriage-settlements
on Kings’ daughters are large and their rank demandeth
that they be not endowed save with a dowry befitting
their degree. At this present I have no money with me till the
coming of my baggage, for I have wealth in plenty and needs
must I make her marriage-portion five thousand purses. Then I
shall need a thousand purses to distribute amongst the poor and
needy on my wedding-night, and other thousand to give to those
who walk in the bridal procession and yet other thousand wherewith
to provide provaunt for the troops and others<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4635" id="noteref-4635" epub:type="noteref">4635</a>; and I shall
want an hundred jewels to give to the Princess on the wedding-morning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4636" id="noteref-4636" epub:type="noteref">4636</a>
and other hundred gems to distribute among the slave-girls
and eunuchs, for I must give each of them a jewel in honour
of the bride; and I need wherewithal to clothe a thousand naked
paupers, and alms too needs must be given. All this cannot be
done till my baggage come; but I have plenty and, once it is
here, I shall make no account of all this outlay.” The Wazir
returned to the King and told him what Ma’aruf said, whereupon
quoth he, “Since this is his wish, how canst thou style him impostor
and liar?” Replied the Minister, “And I cease not to say
this.” But the King chid him angrily and threatened him, saying,
“By the life of my head, an thou cease not this talk, I will slay
thee! Go back to him and fetch him to me and I will manage
matters with him myself.” So the Wazir returned to Ma’aruf
and said to him, “Come and speak with the King.” “I hear and
I obey,” said Ma’aruf and went in to the King, who said to him,
“Thou shalt not put me off with these excuses, for my treasury is
full; so take the keys and spend all thou needest and give what
thou wilt and clothe the poor and do thy desire and have no care
for the girl and the handmaids. When the baggage shall come,
do what thou wilt with thy wife, by way of generosity, and we will
have patience with thee anent the marriage-portion till then, for
there is no manner of difference betwixt me and thee; none at
all.” Then he sent for the Shaykh Al-Islam<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4637" id="noteref-4637" epub:type="noteref">4637</a> and bade him write
out the marriage-contract between his daughter and Merchant
Ma’aruf, and he did so; after which the King gave the signal
for beginning the wedding festivities and bade decorate the city.
The kettle drums beat and the tables were spread with meats of
all kinds and there came performers who paraded their tricks.
Merchant Ma’aruf sat upon a throne in a parlour and the players
and gymnasts and effeminates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4638" id="noteref-4638" epub:type="noteref">4638</a> and dancing-men of wondrous
movements and posture-makers of marvellous cunning came before
him, whilst he called out to the treasurer and said to him, “Bring
gold and silver.” So he brought gold and silver and Ma’aruf went
round among the spectators and largessed each performer by the
handful; and he gave alms to the poor and needy and clothes
to the naked and it was a clamorous festival and a right merry.
The treasurer could not bring money fast enough from the treasury,
and the Wazir’s heart was like to burst for rage; but he dared
not say a word, whilst Merchant Ali marvelled at this waste
of wealth and said to Merchant Ma’aruf, “Allah and the
Hallows visit this upon thy head-sides<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4639" id="noteref-4639" epub:type="noteref">4639</a>! Doth it not suffice
thee to squander the traders’ money, but thou must squander
that of the King to boot?” Replied Ma’aruf, “’Tis none of
thy concern: whenas my baggage shall come, I will requite the
King manifold.” And he went on lavishing money and saying
in himself, “A burning plague! What will happen will happen
and there is no flying from that which is fore-ordained.” The
festivities ceased not for the space of forty days, and on the one-and-fortieth
day, they made the bride’s cortège and all the Emirs
and troops walked before her. When they brought her in before
Ma’aruf, he began scattering gold on the people’s heads, and they
made her a mighty fine procession, whilst Ma’aruf expended in
her honour vast sums of money. Then they brought him in to
Princess Dunya and he sat down on the high divan; after which
they let fall the curtains and shut the doors and withdrew, leaving
him alone with his bride; whereupon he smote hand upon
hand and sat awhile sorrowful and saying, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great!” Quoth the Princess, “O my lord, Allah preserve thee!
What aileth thee that thou art troubled?” Quoth he, “And how
should I be other than troubled, seeing that thy father hath
embarrassed me and done with me a deed which is like the burning
of green corn?” She asked, “And what hath my father done
with thee? Tell me!”; and he answered, “He hath brought me in
to thee before the coming of my baggage, and I want at very least
an hundred jewels to distribute among thy handmaids, to each a
jewel, so she might rejoice therein and say, My lord gave me a
jewel on the night of his going in to my lady. This good deed
would I have done in honour of thy station and for the increase of
thy dignity; and I have no need to stint myself in lavishing jewels,
for I have of them great plenty.” Rejoined she, “Be not concerned
for that. As for me, trouble not thyself about me, for I will have
patience with thee till thy baggage shall come, and as for my
women have no care for them. Rise, doff thy clothes and take
thy pleasure; and when the baggage cometh we shall get the
jewels and the rest.” So he arose and putting off his clothes sat
down on the bed and sought love-liesse and they fell to toying
with each other. He laid his hand on her knee and she sat down
in his lap and thrust her lip like a tit-bit of meat into his mouth,
and that hour was such as maketh a man to forget his father and
his mother. So he clasped her in his arms and strained her fast
to his breast and sucked her lip, till the honey-dew ran out into
his mouth; and he laid his hand under her left-armpit, whereupon
his vitals and her vitals yearned for coition. Then he clapped her
between the breasts and his hand slipped down between her thighs
and she girded him with her legs, whereupon he made of the two
parts proof amain and crying out, “O sire of the chin-veils twain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4640" id="noteref-4640" epub:type="noteref">4640</a><a id="t20"></a>!”
applied the priming and kindled the match and set it to the touch-hole
and gave fire and breached the citadel in its four corners; so
there befel the mystery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4641" id="noteref-4641" epub:type="noteref">4641</a> concerning which there is no enquiry;
and she cried the cry that needs must be cried.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4642" id="noteref-4642" epub:type="noteref">4642</a>——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that while
the Princess Dunya cried the cry which must be cried, Merchant
Ma’aruf abated her maidenhead and that night was one not to be
counted among lives for that which it comprised of the enjoyment
of the fair, clipping and dallying <i><span xml:lang="fr">langue fourrée</span></i> and futtering till
the dawn of day, when he arose and entered the Hammam whence,
after donning a suit for sovrans suitable he betook himself to the
King’s Divan. All who were there rose to him and received him
with honour and worship, giving him joy and invoking blessings
upon him; and he sat down by the King’s side and asked, “Where
is the treasurer?” They answered, “Here he is, before thee,”
and he said to him, “Bring robes of honour for all the Wazirs and
Emirs and dignitaries and clothe them therewith.” The treasurer
brought him all he sought and he sat giving to all who came to
him and lavishing largesse upon every man according to his
station. On this wise he abode twenty days, whilst no baggage
appeared for him nor aught else, till the treasurer was straitened
by him to the uttermost and going in to the King, as he sat alone
with the Wazir in Ma’aruf’s absence, kissed ground between his
hands and said, “O King of the age, I must tell thee somewhat,
lest haply thou blame me for not acquainting thee therewith.
Know that the treasury is being exhausted; there is none but a
little money left in it and in ten days more we shall shut it upon
emptiness.” Quoth the King, “O Wazir, verily my son-in-law’s
baggage-train tarrieth long and there appeareth no news thereof.”
The Minister laughed and said, “Allah be gracious to thee, O
King of the age! Thou art none other but heedless with respect
to this impostor, this liar. As thy head liveth, there is no baggage
for him, no, nor a burning plague to rid us of him! Nay, he hath
but imposed on thee without surcease, so that he hath wasted
thy treasures and married thy daughter for naught. How long
therefore wilt thou be heedless of this liar?” Then quoth the
King, “O Wazir, how shall we do to learn the truth of his case?”;
and quoth the Wazir, “O King of the age, none may come at a
man’s secret but his wife; so send for thy daughter and let her
come behind the curtain, that I may question her of the truth of
his estate, to the intent that she may make question of him and
acquaint us with his case.” Cried the King, “There is no harm in
that; and as my head liveth, if it be proved that he is a liar and
an impostor, I will verily do him die by the foulest of deaths!”
Then he carried the Wazir into the sitting-chamber and sent for
his daughter, who came behind the curtain, her husband being
absent, and said, “What wouldst thou, O my father?” Said he
“Speak with the Wazir.” So she asked, “Ho thou, the Wazir,
what is thy will?”; and he answered, “O my lady, thou must
know that thy husband hath squandered thy father’s substance
and married thee without a dower; and he ceaseth not to promise
us and break his promises, nor cometh there any tidings of his
baggage; in short we would have thee inform us concerning him.”
Quoth she, “Indeed his words be many, and he still cometh and
promiseth me jewels and treasures and costly stuffs; but I see
nothing.” Quoth the Wazir, “O my lady, canst thou this night
take and give with him in talk and whisper to him:—Say me sooth
and fear from me naught, for thou art become my husband and I
will not transgress against thee. So tell me the truth of the matter
and I will devise thee a device whereby thou shalt be set at rest.
And do thou play near and far<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4643" id="noteref-4643" epub:type="noteref">4643</a> with him in words and profess love
to him and win him to confess and after tell us the facts of his case.”
And she answered, “O my papa, I know how I will make proof
of him.” Then she went away and after supper her husband came
in to her, according to his wont, whereupon Princess Dunya
rose to him and took him under the armpit and wheedled
him with winsomest wheedling (and all-sufficient<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4644" id="noteref-4644" epub:type="noteref">4644</a> are woman’s
wiles whenas she would aught of men); and she ceased not
to caress him and beguile him with speech sweeter than the
honey till she stole his reason; and when she saw that he altogether
inclined to her, she said to him, “O my beloved, O coolth
of my eyes and fruit of my vitals, Allah never desolate me by less
of thee nor Time sunder us twain me and thee! Indeed, the love
of thee hath homed in my heart and the fire of passion hath consumed
my liver, nor will I ever forsake thee or transgress against
thee. But I would have thee tell me the truth, for that the
sleights of falsehood profit not, nor do they secure credit at all
seasons. How long wilt thou impose upon my father and lie to
him? I fear lest thine affair be discovered to him, ere we can
devise some device and he lay violent hands upon thee? So
acquaint me with the facts of the case for naught shall befal thee
save that which shall begladden thee; and, when thou shalt have
spoken sooth, fear not harm shall betide thee. How often wilt
thou declare that thou art a merchant and a man of money and
hast a luggage-train? This long while past thou sayest, My
baggage! my baggage! but there appeareth no sign of thy
baggage, and visible in thy face is anxiety on this account. So
an there be no worth in thy words, tell me and I will contrive
thee a contrivance whereby thou shalt come off safe, Inshallah!”
He replied, “I will tell thee the truth, and then do thou whatso
thou wilt.” Rejoined she, “Speak and look thou speak soothly; for
sooth is the ark of safety, and beware of lying, for it dishonoureth
the liar and God-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<p>He said, “Know, then, O my lady, that I am no merchant and
have no baggage, no, nor a burning plague; nay, I was but a
cobbler in my own country and had a wife called Fatimah the
Dung, with whom there befel me this and that.” And he told
her his story from beginning to end; whereat she laughed and
said, “Verily, thou art clever in the practice of lying and imposture!”
Whereto he answered, “O my lady, may Allah
Almighty preserve thee to veil sins and countervail chagrins!”
Rejoined she, “Know, that thou imposedst upon my sire and
deceivedst him by dint of thy deluding vaunts, so that of his
greed for gain he married me to thee. Then thou squanderedst
his wealth and the Wazir beareth thee a grudge for this. How
many a time hath he spoken against thee to my father, saying,
Indeed, he is an impostor, a liar! But my sire hearkened not to
his say, for that he had sought me in wedlock and I consented not
that he be baron and I femme. However, the time grew longsome
upon my sire and he became straitened and said to me,
Make him confess. So I have made thee confess and that which
was covered is discovered. Now my father purposeth thee a mischief
because of this; but thou art become my husband and I will never
transgress against thee. An I told my father what I have learnt
from thee, he would be certified of thy falsehood and imposture and
that thou imposest upon Kings’ daughters and squanderest royal
wealth: so would thine offence find with him no pardon and he
would slay thee sans a doubt: wherefore it would be bruited
among the folk that I married a man who was a liar, an impostor,
and this would smirch mine honour. Furthermore an he kill
thee, most like he will require me to wed another, and to such
thing I will never consent; no, not though I die!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4645" id="noteref-4645" epub:type="noteref">4645</a> So rise
now and don a Mameluke’s dress and take these fifty thousand
dinars of my monies, and mount a swift steed and get thee to a
land whither the rule of my father doth not reach. Then make
thee a merchant and send me a letter by a courier who shall
bring it privily to me, that I may know in what land thou art, so
I may send thee all my hand can attain. Thus shall thy wealth
wax great and if my father die, I will send for thee, and thou
shalt return in respect and honour; and if we die, thou or I and
go to the mercy of God the Most Great, the Resurrection shall
unite us. This, then, is the rede that is right: and while we both
abide alive and well, I will not cease to send thee letters and
monies. Arise ere the day wax bright and thou be in perplexed
plight and perdition upon thy head alight!” Quoth he, “O my
lady, I beseech thee of thy favour to bid me farewell with thine
embracement;” and quoth she, “No harm in that.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4646" id="noteref-4646" epub:type="noteref">4646</a> So he
embraced her and knew her carnally; after which he made the
Ghusl-ablution; then, donning the dress of a white slave, he bade
the syces saddle him a thoroughbred steed. Accordingly, they
saddled him a courser and he mounted and farewelling his wife,
rode forth the city at the last of the night, whilst all who saw him
deemed him one of the Mamelukes of the Sultan going abroad on
some business. Next morning, the King and his Wazir repaired
to the sitting-chamber and sent for Princess Dunya who came
behind the curtain; and her father said to her, “O my daughter,
what sayst thou?” Said she, “I say, Allah blacken thy Wazir’s
face, because he would have blackened my face in my husband’s
eyes!” Asked the King, “How so?”; and she answered, “He
came in to me yesterday; but, before I could name the matter to
him, behold, in walked Faraj the Chief Eunuch, letter in hand,
and said:—Ten white slaves stand under the palace window and
have given me this letter, saying:—Kiss for us the hands of our
lord, Merchant Ma’aruf, and give him this letter, for we are of his
Mamelukes with the baggage, and it hath reached us that he hath
wedded the King’s daughter, so we are come to acquaint him with
that which befel us by the way. Accordingly I took the letter
and read as follows:—From the five hundred Mamelukes to his
highness our lord Merchant Ma’aruf. But further. We give thee
to know that, after thou quittedst us, the Arabs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4647" id="noteref-4647" epub:type="noteref">4647</a> came out upon us
and attacked us. They were two thousand horse and we five
hundred mounted slaves and there befel a mighty sore fight
between us and them. They hindered us from the road thirty days
doing battle with them and this is the cause of our tarrying from
thee.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess
Dunya said to her sire, “My husband received a letter from his
dependents ending with:—The Arabs hindered us from the road
thirty days which is the cause of our being behind time. They
also took from us of the luggage two hundred loads of cloth and
slew of us fifty Mamelukes. When the news reached my husband,
he cried, Allah disappoint them! What ailed them to wage war
with the Arabs for the sake of two hundred loads of merchandise?
What are two hundred loads? It behoved them not to tarry on
that account, for verily the value of the two hundred loads is only
some seven thousand dinars. But needs must I go to them and
hasten them. As for that which the Arabs have taken, ’twill not
be missed from the baggage, nor doth it weigh with me a whit, for
I reckon it as if I had given it to them by way of an alms. Then
he went down from me, laughing and taking no concern for the
wastage of his wealth nor the slaughter of his slaves. As soon as
he was gone, I looked out from the lattice and saw the ten Mamelukes
who had brought him the letter, as they were moons, each
clad in a suit of clothes worth two thousand dinars, there is not
with my father a chattel to match one of them. He went forth
with them to bring up his baggage and hallowed be Allah who
hindered me from saying to him aught of that thou badest me, for
he would have made mock of me and thee, and haply he would
have eyed me with the eye of disparagement and hated me. But
the fault is all with thy Wazir,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4648" id="noteref-4648" epub:type="noteref">4648</a> who speaketh against my husband
words that besit him not.” Replied the King, “O my daughter,
thy husband’s wealth is indeed endless and he recketh not of it;
for, from the day he entered our city, he hath done naught but
give alms to the poor. Inshallah, he will speedily return with the
baggage, and good in plenty shall betide us from him.” And he
went on to appease her and menace the Wazir, being duped by
her device. So fared it with the King; but as regards Merchant
Ma’aruf he rode on into waste lands, perplexed and knowing not
to what quarter he should betake him; and for the anguish of
parting he lamented and in the pangs of passion and love-longing
he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Time falsed our Union and divided who were one in tway; ✿ And the sore tyranny of Time doth melt my heart away:</div>
      <div class="line">Mine eyes ne’er cease to drop the tear for parting with my dear; ✿ When shall Disunion come to end and dawn the Union-day?</div>

</div>

<p>And when he ended his verses, he wept with sore weeping, for
indeed the ways were walled up before his face and death seemed
to him better than dreeing life, and he walked on like a drunken
man for stress of distraction, and stayed not till noontide, when he
came to a little town and saw a plougher hard by, ploughing with
a yoke of bulls. Now hunger was sore upon him; and he went
up to the ploughman and said to him, “Peace be with thee!”;
and he returned his salam and said to him, “Welcome, O my lord!
Art thou one of the Sultan’s Mamelukes?” Quoth Ma’aruf,
“Yes;” and the other said, “Alight with me for a guest-meal.”
Whereupon Ma’aruf knew him to be of the liberal and said to him,
“O my brother, I see with thee naught with which thou mayst
feed me: how is it, then, that thou invitest me?” Answered the
husbandman, “O my lord, weal is well nigh.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4652" id="noteref-4652" epub:type="noteref">4652</a> Dismount thee
here: the town is near hand and I will go and fetch thee dinner
and fodder for thy stallion.” Rejoined Ma’aruf, “Since the town
is near at hand, I can go thither as quickly as thou canst and buy
me what I have a mind to in the bazar and eat.” The peasant
replied, “O my lord, the place is but a little village<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4653" id="noteref-4653" epub:type="noteref">4653</a> and there is
no bazar there, neither selling nor buying. So I conjure thee by
Allah, alight here with me and hearten my heart, and I will run
thither and return to thee in haste.” Accordingly he dismounted
and the Fellah left him and went off to the village, to fetch dinner
for him whilst Ma’aruf sat awaiting him. Presently he said in
himself, “I have taken this poor man away from his work; but I
will arise and plough in his stead, till he come back, to make up
for having hindered him from his work.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4654" id="noteref-4654" epub:type="noteref">4654</a>” Then he took the
plough and starting the bulls, ploughed a little, till the share
struck against something and the beasts stopped. He goaded them
on, but they could not move the plough; so he looked at the share
and finding it caught in a ring of gold, cleared away the soil and
saw that it was set centre-most a slab of alabaster, the size of the
nether millstone. He strave at the stone till he pulled it from its
place, when there appeared beneath it a souterrain with a stair.
Presently he descended the flight of steps and came to a place
like a Hammam, with four<a id="t28"></a> daïses, the first full of gold, from floor to
roof, the second full of emeralds and pearls and coral also from
ground to ceiling; the third of jacinths and rubies and turquoises
and the fourth of diamonds and all manner other preciousest
stones. At the upper end of the place stood a coffer of clearest
crystal, full of union-gems each the size of a walnut, and upon the
coffer lay a casket of gold, the bigness of a lemon. When he saw
this, he marvelled and rejoiced with joy exceeding and said to
himself, “I wonder what is in this casket?” So he opened it and
found therein a seal-ring of gold, whereon were graven names and
talismans, as they were the tracks of creeping ants. He rubbed
the ring and behold, a voice said, “Adsum! Here am I, at thy
service, O my lord! Ask and it shall be given unto thee. Wilt
thou raise a city or ruin a capital or kill a king or dig a river-channel
or aught of the kind? Whatso thou seekest, it shall
come to pass, by leave of the King of All-might, Creator of day
and night.” Ma’aruf asked, “O creature of my lord, who and
what art thou?”; and the other answered, “I am the slave of
this seal-ring standing in the service of him who possesseth it.
Whatsoever he seeketh, that I accomplish for him, and I have no
excuse in neglecting that he biddeth me do; because I am Sultan
over two-and-seventy tribes of the Jinn, each two-and-seventy
thousand in number every one of which thousand ruleth over a
thousand Marids, each Marid over a thousand Ifrits, each Ifrit
over a thousand Satans and each Satan over a thousand Jinn: and
they are all under command of me and may not gainsay me. As
for me, I am spelled to this seal-ring and may not thwart whoso
holdeth it. Lo! thou hast gotten hold of it and I am become thy
slave; so ask what thou wilt, for I hearken to thy word and
obey thy bidding; and if thou have need of me at any time, by
land or by sea rub the signet-ring and thou wilt find me with thee.
But beware of rubbing it twice in succession, or thou wilt consume
me with the fire of the names graven thereon; and thus
wouldst thou lose me and after regret me. Now I have acquainted
thee with my case and—the Peace!”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Slave of the Signet-ring acquainted Ma’aruf with his case,
the Merchant asked him, “What is thy name?” and the Jinni
answered, “My name is Abú al-Sa’ádát.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4655" id="noteref-4655" epub:type="noteref">4655</a>” Quoth Ma’aruf, “O
Abu al-Sa’adat what is this place and who enchanted thee in this
casket?”; and quoth he, “O my lord, this is a treasure called the
Hoard of Shaddád son of Ad, him who the base of ‘Many-columned
Iram laid, the like of which in the lands was never
made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4656" id="noteref-4656" epub:type="noteref">4656</a>’ I was his slave in his lifetime and this is his Seal-ring,
which he laid up in his treasure; but it hath fallen to thy lot.”
Ma’aruf enquired, “Canst thou transport that which is in this
hoard to the surface of the earth?”; and the Jinni replied, “Yes!
Nothing were easier.” Said Ma’aruf, “Bring it forth and leave
naught.” So the Jinni signed with his hand to the ground, which
clave asunder, and he sank and was absent a little while. Presently,
there came forth young boys full of grace, and fair of face bearing
golden baskets filled with gold which they emptied out and going
away, returned with more; nor did they cease to transport the
gold and jewels, till ere an hour had sped they said, “Naught is
left in the hoard.” Thereupon out came Abu al-Sa’adat and said
to Ma’aruf, “O my lord, thou seest that we have brought forth all
that was in the hoard.” Ma’aruf asked, “Who be these beautiful
boys?” and the Jinni answered, “They are my sons. This
matter merited not that I should muster for it the Marids, wherefore
my sons have done thy desire and are honoured by such
service. So ask what thou wilt beside this.” Quoth Ma’aruf,
“Canst thou bring me he-mules and chests and fill the chests with
the treasure and load them on the mules?” Quoth Abu al-Sa’adat,
“Nothing easier,” and cried a great cry; whereupon his
sons presented themselves before him, to the number of eight
hundred, and he said to them, “Let some of you take the semblance
of he-mules and others of muleteers and handsome Mamelukes, the
like of the least of whom is not found with any of the Kings; and
others of you be transmewed to muleteers, and the rest to menials.”
So seven hundred of them changed themselves into bât-mules and
other hundred took the shape of slaves. Then Abu al-Sa’adat
called upon his Marids, who presented themselves between his
hands and he commanded some of them to assume the aspect of
horses saddled with saddles of gold crusted with jewels. And
when Ma’aruf saw them do as he bade he cried, “Where be the
chests?” They brought them before him and he said, “Pack the
gold and the stones, each sort by itself.” So they packed them
and loaded three hundred he-mules with them. Then asked
Ma’aruf, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, canst thou bring me some loads of
costly stuffs?”; and the Jinni answered, “Wilt thou have Egyptian
stuffs or Syrian or Persian or Indian or Greek?” Ma’aruf said,
“Bring me an hundred loads of each kind, on five hundred mules;”
and Abu al-Sa’adat, “O my lord accord me delay that I may
dispose my Marids for this and send a company of them to each
country to fetch an hundred loads of its stuffs and then take the
form of he-mules and return, carrying the stuffs.” Ma’aruf
enquired, “What time dost thou want?”; and Abu al-Sa’adat
replied, “The time of the blackness of the night, and day shall not
dawn ere thou have all thou desirest.” Said Ma’aruf, “I grant
thee this time,” and bade them pitch him a pavilion. So they
pitched it and he sat down therein and they brought him a table
of food. Then said Abu al-Sa’adat to him, “O my lord, tarry
thou in this tent and these my sons shall guard thee: so fear
thou nothing; for I go to muster my Marids and despatch them
to do thy desire.” So saying, he departed, leaving Ma’aruf
seated in the pavilion, with the table before him and the Jinni’s
sons attending upon him, in the guise of slaves and servants and
suite. And while he sat in this state behold, up came the husbandman,
with a great porringer of lentils<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4657" id="noteref-4657" epub:type="noteref">4657</a> and a nose-bag full of
barley and seeing the pavilion pitched and the Mamelukes standing,
hands upon breasts, thought that the Sultan was come and had
halted on that stead. So he stood open-mouthed and said in
himself, “Would I had killed a couple of chickens and fried them
red with clarified cow-butter for the Sultan!” And he would
have turned back to kill the chickens as a regale for the Sultan;
but Ma’aruf saw him and cried out to him and said to the
Mamelukes, “Bring him hither.” So they brought him and his
porringer of lentils before Ma’aruf, who said to him, “What is
this?” Said the peasant, “This is thy dinner and thy horse’s
fodder! Excuse me, for I thought not that the Sultan would
come hither; and, had I known that, I would have killed a
couple of chickens and entertained him in goodly guise.” Quoth
Ma’aruf, “The Sultan is not come. I am his son-in-law and I
was vexed with him. However he hath sent his officers to
make his peace with me, and now I am minded to return to
city. But thou hast made me this guest-meal without knowing
me, and I accept it from thee, lentils though it be, and will not
eat save of thy cheer.” Accordingly he bade him set the porringer
amiddlemost the table and ate of it his sufficiency, whilst the
Fellah filled his belly with those rich meats. Then Ma’aruf washed
his hands and gave the Mamelukes leave to eat; so they fell upon
the remains of the meal and ate; and, when the porringer was
empty, he filled it with gold and gave it to the peasant, saying,
“Carry this to thy dwelling and come to me in the city, and I
will entreat thee with honour.” Thereupon the peasant took the
porringer full of gold and returned to the village, driving the bulls
before him and deeming himself akin to the King. Meanwhile,
they brought Ma’aruf girls of the Brides of the Treasure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4658" id="noteref-4658" epub:type="noteref">4658</a> who
smote on instruments of music and danced before him, and he
passed that night in joyance and delight, a night not to be
reckoned among lives. Hardly had dawned the day when there
arose a great cloud of dust which presently lifting, discovered
seven hundred mules laden with stuffs and attended by muleteers
and baggage-tenders and cresset-bearers. With them came Abu
al-Sa’adat, riding on a she-mule, in the guise of a caravan-leader,
and before him was a travelling-litter, with four corner-terminals<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4659" id="noteref-4659" epub:type="noteref">4659</a>
of glittering red gold, set with gems. When Abu al-Sa’adat came
up to the tent, he dismounted and kissing the earth, said to Ma’aruf,
“O my lord, thy desire hath been done to the uttermost and in
the litter is a treasure-suit which hath not its match among Kings’
raiment: so don it and mount the litter and bid us do what thou
wilt.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, I wish thee to go to
the city of Ikhtiyan al-Khutan and present thyself to my father-in-law
the King; and go thou not in to him but in the guise of a
mortal courier;” and quoth he, “To hear is to obey.” So Ma’aruf
wrote a letter to the Sultan and sealed it and Abu al-Sa’adat took
it and set out with it; and when he arrived, he found the King
saying, “O Wazir, indeed my heart is concerned for my son-in-law
and I fear lest the Arabs slay him. Would Heaven I wot
whither he was bound, that I might have followed him with the
troops! Would he had told me his destination!” Said the
Wazir, “Allah be merciful to thee for this thy heedlessness! As
thy head liveth, the wight saw that we were awake to him and
feared dishonour and fled, for he is nothing but an impostor, a
liar.” And behold, at this moment in came the courier and
kissing ground before the King, wished him permanent glory and
prosperity and length of life. Asked the King, “Who art thou
and what is thy business?” “I am a courier,” answered the Jinni,
“and thy son-in-law who is come with the baggage sendeth me to
thee with a letter, and here it is!” So he took the letter and read
therein these words, “After salutations galore to our uncle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4660" id="noteref-4660" epub:type="noteref">4660</a> the
glorious King! Know that I am at hand with the baggage-train:
so come thou forth to meet me with the troops.” Cried the King,
“Allah blacken thy brow, O Wazir! How often wilt thou defame
my son-in-law’s name and call him liar and impostor? Behold,
he is come with the baggage-train and thou art naught but a
traitor.” The Minister hung his head groundwards in shame and
confusion and replied, “O King of the age, I said not this save
because of the long delay of the baggage and because I feared the
loss of the wealth he hath wasted.” The King exclaimed, “O
traitor, what are my riches! Now that his baggage is come he
will give me great plenty in their stead.” Then he bade decorate
the city and going in to his daughter, said to her, “Good news for
thee! Thy husband will be here anon with his baggage; for he
hath sent me a letter to that effect and here am I now going forth
to meet him.” The Princess Dunya marvelled at this and said in
herself, “This is a wondrous thing! Was he laughing at me and
making mock of me, or had he a mind to try me, when he told me
that he was a pauper? But Alhamdolillah, Glory to God, for that
I failed not of my duty to him!” On this wise fared it in the
Palace; but as regards Merchant Ali, the Cairene, when he saw
the decoration of the city and asked the cause thereof, they said
to him, “The baggage-train of Merchant Ma’aruf, the King’s son-in-law,
is come.” Said he, “Allah is Almighty! What a calamity
is this man!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4661" id="noteref-4661" epub:type="noteref">4661</a> He came to me, fleeing from his wife, and he was
a poor man. Whence then should he get a baggage-train? But
haply this is a device which the King’s daughter hath contrived
for him, fearing his disgrace, and Kings are not unable to do anything.
May Allah the Most High veil his fame and not bring
him to public shame!”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Merchant Ali asked the cause of the decorations, they told him
the truth of the case; so he blessed Merchant Ma’aruf and cried,
“May Allah Almighty veil his fame and not bring him to public
shame!” And all the merchants rejoiced and were glad for that
they would get their monies. Then the King assembled his
troops and rode forth, whilst Abu al-Sa’adat returned to Ma’aruf
and acquainted him with the delivering of the letter. Quoth
Ma’aruf, “Bind on the loads;” and when they had done so, he
donned the treasure-suit and mounting the litter became a
thousand times greater and more majestic than the King. Then
he set forward; but, when he had gone half-way, behold, the
King met him with the troops, and seeing him riding in the
Takhtrawan and clad in the dress aforesaid, threw himself upon
him and saluted him, and giving him joy of his safety, greeted
him with the greeting of peace. Then all the Lords of the land
saluted him and it was made manifest that he had spoken the
truth and that in him there was no lie. Presently he entered the
city in such state procession as would have caused the gall-bladder
of the lion to burst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4662" id="noteref-4662" epub:type="noteref">4662</a> for envy and the traders pressed up to him
and kissed his hands, whilst Merchant Ali said to him, “Thou hast
played off this trick and it hath prospered to thy hand, O Shaykh
of Impostors! But thou deservest it and may Allah the Most
High increase thee of His bounty!”; whereupon Ma’aruf laughed.
Then he entered the palace and sitting down on the throne said,
“Carry the loads of gold into the treasury of my uncle the King
and bring me the bales of cloth.” So they brought them to him
and opened them before him, bale after bale, till they had unpacked
the seven hundred loads, whereof he chose out the best and said,
“Bear these to Princess Dunya that she may distribute them
among her slave-girls; and carry her also this coffer of jewels,
that she may divide them among her handmaids and eunuchs.”
Then he proceeded to make over to the merchants in whose debt
he was stuffs by way of payment for their arrears, giving him
whose due was a thousand, stuffs worth two thousand or more;
after which he fell to distributing to the poor and needy, whilst
the King looked on with greedy eyes and could not hinder him;
nor did he cease largesse till he had made an end of the seven
hundred loads, when he turned to the troops and proceeded to
apportion amongst them emeralds and rubies and pearls and coral
and other jewels by handsful, without count, till the King said to
him, “Enough of this giving, O my son! There is but little left
of the baggage.” But he said, “I have plenty.” Then indeed,
his good faith was become manifest and none could give him the
lie; and he had come to reck not of giving, for that the Slave of
the Seal-ring brought him whatsoever he sought. Presently, the
treasurer came in to the King and said, “O King of the age, the
treasury is full indeed and will not hold the rest of the loads.
Where shall we lay that which is left of the gold and jewels?”
And he assigned to him another place. As for the Princess
Dunya when she saw this, her joy redoubled and she marvelled
and said in herself, “Would I wot how came he by all this
wealth!” In like manner the traders rejoiced in that which he
had given them and blessed him; whilst Merchant Ali marvelled
and said to himself, “I wonder how he hath lied and swindled,
that he hath gotten him all these treasures<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4663" id="noteref-4663" epub:type="noteref">4663</a>? Had they come
from the King’s daughter, he had not wasted them on this wise!
But how excellent is his saying who said:—</p>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When the Kings’ King giveth, in reverence pause ✿ And venture not to enquire the cause:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So far concerning him; but as regards the King, he also marvelled
with passing marvel at that which he saw of Ma’aruf’s generosity
and openhandedness in the largesse of wealth. Then the Merchant
went in to his wife, who met him, smiling and laughing-lipped
and kissed his hand, saying, “Didst thou mock me or hadst
thou a mind to prove me with thy saying:—I am a poor man and
a fugitive from my wife? Praised be Allah for that I failed not of
my duty to thee! For thou art my beloved and there is none
dearer to me than thou, whether thou be rich or poor. But I
would have thee tell me what didst thou design by these words.”
Said Ma’aruf, “I wished to prove thee and see whether thy love
were sincere or for the sake of wealth and the greed of worldly
good. But now ’tis become manifest to me that thine affection is
sincere and as thou art a true woman, so welcome to thee! I know
thy worth.” Then he went apart into a place by himself and
rubbed the seal-ring, whereupon Abu al-Sa’adat presented himself
and said to him, “Adsum, at thy service! Ask what thou wilt.”
Quoth Ma’aruf, “I want a treasure-suit and treasure-trinkets for
my wife, including a necklace of forty unique jewels.” Quoth the
Jinni, “To hear is to obey,” and brought him what he sought,
whereupon Ma’aruf dismissed him and carrying the dress and
ornaments in to his wife, laid them before her and said, “Take
these and put them on and welcome!” When she saw this, her
wits fled for joy, and she found among the ornaments a pair of
anklets of gold set with jewels of the handiwork of the magicians,
and bracelets and earrings and a belt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4664" id="noteref-4664" epub:type="noteref">4664</a> such as no money could
buy. So she donned the dress and ornaments and said to Ma’aruf,
“O my lord, I will treasure these up for holidays and festivals.”
But he answered, “Wear them always, for I have others in plenty.”
And when she put them on and her women beheld her, they
rejoiced and bussed his hands. Then he left them and going
apart by himself, rubbed the seal-ring whereupon its slave appeared
and he said to him, “Bring me an hundred suits of apparel, with
their ornaments of gold.” “Hearing and obeying,” answered Abu
al Sa’adat and brought him the hundred suits, each with its ornaments
wrapped up within it. Ma’aruf took them and called aloud
to the slave-girls, who came to him and he gave them each a suit:
so they donned them and became like the black-eyed girls of
Paradise, whilst the Princess Dunya shone amongst them as the
moon among the stars. One of the handmaids told the King of
this and he came in to his daughter and saw her and her women
dazzling all who beheld them; whereat he wondered with passing
wonderment. Then he went out and calling his Wazir, said to
him, “O Wazir, such and such things have happened; what sayst
thou now of this affair?” Said he, “O King of the age, this be
no merchant’s fashion; for a merchant keepeth a piece of linen
by him for years and selleth it not but at a profit. How should
a merchant have generosity such as this generosity, and whence
should he get the like of these monies and jewels, of which but a
slight matter is found with the Kings? So how should loads
thereof be found with merchants? Needs must there be a cause
for this; but, an thou wilt hearken to me, I will make the truth of
the case manifest to thee.” Answered the King, “O Wazir, I will
do thy bidding.” Rejoined the Minister, “Do thou foregather
with thy son-in-law and make a show of affect to him and talk
with him and say:—O my son-in-law, I have a mind to go, I and
thou and the Wazir but no more, to a flower-garden that we may
take our pleasure there. When we come to the garden, we will
set on the table wine, and I will ply him therewith and compel
him to drink; for, when he shall have drunken, he will lose his
reason and his judgment will forsake him. Then we will question
him of the truth of his case and he will discover to us his secrets,
for wine is a traitor and Allah-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When we drank the wine, and it crept its way ✿ To the place of Secrets, I cried, “O stay!”</div>
      <div class="line">In my fear lest its influence stint my wits ✿ And my friends spy matters that hidden lay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he hath told us the truth we shall ken his case and may
deal with him as we will; because I fear for thee the consequences
of this his present fashion: haply he will covet the kingship and
win over the troops by generosity and lavishing money and so
depose thee and take the kingdom from thee.” “True,” answered
the King.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Wazir devised this device the King said to him, “Thou hast spoken
sooth!”; and they passed the night on this agreement. And when
morning morrowed the King went forth and sat in the guest-chamber,
when lo, and behold! the grooms and serving-men came
in to him in dismay. Quoth he, “What hath befallen you?”;
and quoth they, “O King of the age, the Syces curried the horses
and foddered them and the he-mules which brought the baggage;
but, when we arose in the morning, we found that thy son-in-law’s
Mamelukes had stolen the horses and mules. We searched the
stables, but found neither horse nor mule; so we entered the
lodging of the Mamelukes and found none there, nor know we
how they fled.” The King marvelled at this, unknowing that the
horses and Mamelukes were all Ifrits, the subjects of the Slave
of the Spell, and asked the grooms, “O accursed how could a thousand
beasts and five hundred slaves and servants flee without your
knowledge?” Answered they, “We know not how it happened,”
and he cried, “Go, and when your lord cometh forth of the Harim,
tell him the case.” So they went out from before the King and
sat down bewildered, till Ma’aruf came out and, seeing them
chagrined enquired of them, “What may be the matter?” They
told him all that had happened and he said, “What is their worth
that ye should be concerned for them? Wend your ways.” And
he sat laughing and was neither angry nor grieved concerning the
case; whereupon the King looked in the Wazir’s face and said
to him, “What manner of man is this, with whom wealth is of no
worth? Needs must there be a reason for this?” Then they
talked with him awhile and the King said to him, “O my son-in-law,
I have a mind to go, I, thou and the Wazir, to a garden,
where we may divert ourselves.” “No harm in that,” said Ma’aruf.
So they went forth to a flower-garden, wherein every sort of fruit
was of kinds twain and its waters were flowing and its trees
towering and its birds carolling. There they entered a pavilion,
whose sight did away sorrow from the soul, and sat talking, whilst
the Minister entertained them with rare tales and quoted merry
quips and mirth-provoking sayings and Ma’aruf attentively
listened, till the time of dinner came, when they set on a tray
of meats and a flagon of wine. When they had eaten and
washed hands, the Wazir filled the cup and gave it to the King,
who drank it off; then he filled a second and handed it to
Ma’aruf, saying, “Take the cup of the drink to which Reason
boweth neck in reverence.” Quoth Ma’aruf, “What is this, O
Wazir?”; and quoth he, “This is the grizzled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4665" id="noteref-4665" epub:type="noteref">4665</a> virgin and the
old maid long kept at home,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4666" id="noteref-4666" epub:type="noteref">4666</a> the giver of joy to hearts, whereof

<p>And he ceased not to egg him on to the drink, naming to him
such of the virtues of wine as he thought well and reciting to him
what occurred to him of poetry and pleasantries on the subject, till
Ma’aruf addressed himself to sucking the cup-lips and cared no
longer for aught else. The Wazir ceased not to fill for him and he
to drink and enjoy himself and make merry, till his wits wandered
and he could not distinguish right from wrong. When the Minister
saw that drunkenness had attained in him to utterest and the
bounds transgressed, he said to him, “By Allah, O Merchant
Ma’aruf, I admire whence thou gottest these jewels whose like the
Kings of the Chosroës possess not! In all our lives never saw we
a merchant that had heaped up riches like unto thine or more
generous than thou, for thy doings are the doings of Kings and
not merchants’ doings. Wherefore, Allah upon thee, do thou
acquaint me with this, that I may know thy rank and condition.”
And he went on to test him with questions and cajole him, till
Ma’aruf, being reft of reason, said to him, “I’m neither merchant
nor King,” and told him his whole story from first to last. Then
said the Wazir, “I conjure thee by Allah, O my lord Ma’aruf,
show us the ring, that we may see its make.” So, in his drunkenness,
he pulled off the ring and said, “Take it and look upon it.”
The Minister took it and turning it over, said, “If I rub it, will
its slave appear?” Replied Ma’aruf, “Yes. Rub it and he will
appear to thee, and do thou divert thyself with the sight of him.”
Thereupon the Wazir rubbed the ring and behold forthright appeared
the Jinni and said, “Adsum, at thy service, O my lord!
Ask and it shall be given to thee. Wilt thou ruin a city or raise
a capital or kill a king? Whatso thou seekest, I will do for thee,
sans fail.” The Wazir pointed to Ma’aruf and said, “Take up
yonder wretch and cast him down in the most desolate of desert
lands, where he shall find nothing to eat nor drink, so he may die
of hunger and perish miserably, and none know of him.” Accordingly,
the Jinni snatched him up and flew with him betwixt heaven
and earth, which when Ma’aruf saw, he made sure of destruction
and wept and said, “O Abu al-Sa’adat, whither goest thou with
me?” Replied the Jinni, “I go to cast thee down in the Desert
Quarter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4681" id="noteref-4681" epub:type="noteref">4681</a> O ill-bred wight of gross wits. Shall one have the like
of this talisman and give it to the folk to gaze at? Verily, thou
deservest that which hath befallen thee; and but that I fear Allah,
I would let thee fall from a<a href="#f91" class="c016"><sup>[91]</sup></a> eight of a thousand fathoms, nor
shouldst thou reach the earth, till the winds had torn thee to
shreds.” Ma’aruf was silent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4682" id="noteref-4682" epub:type="noteref">4682</a> and did not again bespeak him till
he reached the Desert Quarter and casting him down there, went
away and left him in that horrible place.——And Shahrazad perceived

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Slave
of the Seal-ring took up Ma’aruf and cast him down in the Desert
Quarter where he left him and went his ways. So much concerning
him; but returning to the Wazir who was now in possession
of the talisman, he said to the King, “How deemest thou now?
Did I not tell thee that this fellow was a liar, an impostor, but
thou wouldst not credit me?” Replied the King, “Thou wast in
the right, O my Wazir, Allah grant thee weal! But give me the
ring, that I may solace myself with the sight.” The Minister
looked at him angrily and spat in his face, saying, “O lack-wits,
how shall I give it to thee and abide thy servant, after I am
become thy master? But I will spare thee no more on life.” Then
he rubbed the seal-ring and said to the Slave, “Take up this ill-mannered
churl and cast him down by his son-in-law the swindler-man.”
So the Jinni took him up and flew off with him, whereupon
quoth the King to him, “O creature of my Lord, what is my
crime?” Abu al-Sa’adat replied, “That wot I not, but my master
hath commanded me and I cannot cross whoso hath compassed
the enchanted ring.” Then he flew on with him, till he came to
the Desert Quarter and, casting him down where he had cast
Ma’aruf left him and returned. The King hearing Ma’aruf weeping,
went up to him and acquainted him with his case; and they
sat weeping over that which had befallen them and found neither
meat nor drink. Meanwhile the Minister, after driving father-in-law
and son-in-law from the country, went forth from the garden
and summoning all the troops held a Divan, and told them what
he had done with the King and Ma’aruf and acquainted them
with the affair of the talisman, adding, “Unless ye make me Sultan
over you, I will bid the Slave of the Seal-ring take you up one and
all and cast you down in the Desert Quarter where you shall die
of hunger and thirst.” They replied, “Do us no damage, for we
accept thee as Sultan over us and will not anywise gainsay thy
bidding.” So they agreed, in their own despite, to his being
Sultan over them, and he bestowed on them robes of honour,
seeking all he had a mind to of Abu al-Sa’adat, who brought it to
him forthwith. Then he sat down on the throne and the troops
did homage to him; and he sent to Princess Dunya, the King’s
daughter, saying, “Make thee ready, for I mean to come in unto
thee this night, because I long for thee with love.” When she
heard this, she wept, for the case of her husband and father was
grievous to her, and sent to him saying, “Have patience with me
till my period of widowhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4683" id="noteref-4683" epub:type="noteref">4683</a> be ended: then draw up thy contract
of marriage with me and go in to me according to law.” But he
sent back to say to her, “I know neither period of widowhood nor
to delay have I a mood; and I need not a contract nor know I
lawful from unlawful; but needs must I go in unto thee this night.”
She answered him saying, “So be it, then, and welcome to thee!”;
but this was a trick on her part. When the answer reached the
Wazir, he rejoiced and his breast was broadened, for that he was
passionately in love with her. He bade set food before all the
folk, saying, “Eat; this is my bride-feast; for I purpose to go in
to the Princess Dunya this night.” Quoth the Shaykh al-Islam,
“It is not lawful for thee to go in unto her till her days of widowhood
be ended and thou have drawn up thy contract of marriage
with her.” But he answered, “I know neither days of widowhood
nor other period; so multiply not words on me.” The Shaykh
Al-Islam was silent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4684" id="noteref-4684" epub:type="noteref">4684</a> fearing his mischief, and said to the troops,
“Verily, this man is a Kafir, a Miscreant, and hath neither creed
nor religious conduct.” As soon as it was evenfall, he went in to
her and found her robed in her richest raiment and decked with
her goodliest adornments. When she saw him, she came to meet
him, laughing and said, “A blessed night! But hadst thou slain
my father and my husband, it had been more to my mind.” And
he said, “There is no help but I slay them.” Then she made him
sit down and began to jest with him and make show of love
caressing him and smiling in his face so that his reason fled; but
she cajoled him with her coaxing and cunning only that she might
get possession of the ring and change his joy into calamity on the
mother of his forehead:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4685" id="noteref-4685" epub:type="noteref">4685</a> nor did she deal thus with him but after
the rede of him who said<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4686" id="noteref-4686" epub:type="noteref">4686</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

  </div>
</div>

<p>When he saw her caress him and smile upon him, desire surged up
in him and he besought her of carnal knowledge; but, when he
approached her, she drew away from him and burst into tears,
saying, “O my lord, seest thou not the man looking at us? I
conjure thee by Allah, screen me from his eyes! How canst thou
know me what while he looketh on us?” When he heard this, he
was angry and asked, “Where is the man?”; and answered she,
“There he is, in the bezel of the ring! putting out his head and
staring at us.” He thought that the Jinni was looking at them
and said laughing, “Fear not; this is the Slave of the Seal-ring,
and he is subject to me.” Quoth she, “I am afraid of Ifrits; pull
it off and throw it afar from me.” So he plucked it off and laying
it on the cushion, drew near to her, but she dealt him a kick, her
foot striking him full in the stomach<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4687" id="noteref-4687" epub:type="noteref">4687</a>, and he fell over on his back
senseless; whereupon she cried out to her attendants, who came
to her in haste, and said to them, “Seize him!” So forty slave-girls
laid hold on him, whilst she hurriedly snatched up the ring
from the cushion and rubbed it; whereupon Abu al-Sa’adat presented
himself, saying, “Adsum, at thy service O my mistress.”
Cried she, “Take up yonder Infidel and clap him in jail and
shackle him heavily.” So he took him and throwing him into the
Prison of Wrath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4688" id="noteref-4688" epub:type="noteref">4688</a> returned and reported, “I have laid him in
limbo.” Quoth she, “Whither wentest thou with my father and
my husband?”; and quoth he, “I cast them down in the Desert
Quarter.” Then cried she, “I command thee to fetch them to me
forthwith.” He replied, “I hear and I obey,” and taking flight at
once, stayed not till he reached the Desert Quarter, where he
lighted down upon them and found them sitting weeping and complaining
each to other. Quoth he, “Fear not, for relief is come to
you”; and he told them what the Wazir had done, adding, “Indeed
I imprisoned him with my own hands in obedience to her, and she
hath bidden me bear you back.” And they rejoiced in his news.
Then he took them both up and flew home with them; nor was it
more than an hour before he brought them in to Princess Dunya,
who rose and saluted sire and spouse. Then she made them sit
down and brought them food and sweetmeats, and they passed the
rest of the night with her. On the next day she clad them in rich
clothing and said to the King, “O my papa, sit thou upon thy
throne and be King as before and make my husband thy Wazir of
the Right and tell thy troops that which hath happened. Then
send for the Minister out of prison and do him die, and after burn
him, for that he is a Miscreant, and would have gone in unto me
in the way of lewdness, without the rites of wedlock and he hath
testified against himself that he is an Infidel and believeth in no
religion. And do tenderly by thy son-in-law, whom thou makest
thy Wazir of the Right.” He replied, “Hearing and obeying, O
my daughter. But do thou give me the ring or give it to thy
husband.” Quoth she, “It behoveth not that either thou or he
have the ring. I will keep the ring myself, and belike I shall be
more careful of it than you. Whatso ye wish seek it of me and I
will demand it for you of the Slave of the Seal-ring. So fear no
harm so long as I live and after my death, do what ye twain will
with the ring.” Quoth the King, “This is the right rede, O my
daughter,” and taking his son-in-law went forth to the Divan.
Now the troops had passed the night in sore chagrin for Princess
Dunya and that which the Wazir had done with her, in going in to
her after the way of lewdness, without marriage-rites, and for his
ill-usage of the King and Ma’aruf, and they feared lest the law of
Al-Islam be dishonoured, because it was manifest to them that he
was a Kafir. So they assembled in the Divan and fell to reproaching
the Shaykh al-Islam, saying, “Why didst thou not forbid him
from going in to the Princess in the way of lewdness?” Said he,
“O folk, the man is a Miscreant and hath gotten possession of the
ring and I and you may not prevail against him. But Almighty
Allah will requite him his deed, and be ye silent, lest he slay you.”
And as the host was thus engaged in talk, behold the King and
Ma’aruf entered the Divan.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the troops sorely chagrined sat in the Divan talking over the ill-deeds
done by the Wazir to their Sovran, his son-in-law and his
daughter, behold, the King and Ma’aruf entered. Then the King
bade decorate the city and sent to fetch the Wazir from the place
of duresse. So they brought him, and as he passed by the troops,
they cursed him and abused him and menaced him, till he came to
the King, who commanded to do him dead by the vilest of deaths.
Accordingly, they slew him and after burned his body, and he went
to Hell after the foulest of plights; and right well quoth one of
him:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The Compassionate show no ruth to the tomb where his bones shall lie ✿ And Munkar and eke Nakír<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4689" id="noteref-4689" epub:type="noteref">4689</a> ne’er cease to abide thereby!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The King made Ma’aruf his Wazir of the Right and the times were
pleasant to them and their joys were untroubled. They abode
thus five years till, in the sixth year, the King died and Princess
Dunya made Ma’aruf Sultan in her father’s stead, but she gave
him not the seal-ring. During this time she had conceived by
him and borne him a boy of passing loveliness, excelling in beauty
and perfection, who ceased not to be reared in the laps of nurses
till he reached the age of five, when his mother fell sick of a deadly
sickness and calling her husband to her, said to him, “I am ill.”
Quoth he, “Allah preserve thee, O dearling of my heart!” But
quoth she, “Haply I shall die and thou needest not that I commend
to thy care thy son: wherefore I charge thee but be careful
of the ring, for thine own sake and for the sake of this thy boy.”
And he answered, “No harm shall befal him whom Allah preserveth!”
Then she pulled off the ring and gave it to him, and
on the morrow she was admitted to the mercy of Allah the Most
High,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4690" id="noteref-4690" epub:type="noteref">4690</a> whilst Ma’aruf abode in possession of the kingship and
applied himself to the business of governing. Now it chanced
that one day, as he shook the handkerchief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4691" id="noteref-4691" epub:type="noteref">4691</a> and the troops withdrew
to their places that he betook himself to the sitting-chamber,
where he sat till the day departed and the night advanced with
murks bedight. Then came in to him his cup-companions of the
notables according to their custom, and sat with him by way of
solace and diversion, till midnight, when they craved permission to
withdraw. He gave them leave and they retired to their houses;
after which there came in to him a slave-girl affected to the service
of his bed, who spread him the mattress and doffing his apparel,
clad him in his sleeping-gown. Then he lay down and she kneaded
his feet, till sleep overpowered him; whereupon she withdrew to
her own chamber and slept. But suddenly he felt something beside
him in the bed and awaking started up in alarm and cried, “I
seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned!” Then he opened
his eyes and seeing by his side a woman foul of favour, said to her,
“Who art thou?” Said she, “Fear not, I am thy wife Fatimah
al-Urrah.” Whereupon he looked in her face and knew her by her
loathly form and the length of her dog-teeth: so he asked her,
“Whence camest thou in to me and who brought thee to this
country?” “In what country art thou at this present?” “In the
city of Ikhtiyan al-Khutan. But thou, when didst thou leave
Cairo?” “But now.” “How can that be?” “Know,” said she,
“that, when I fell out with thee and Satan prompted me to do thee
a damage, I complained of thee to the magistrates, who sought for
thee and the Kazis enquired of thee, but found thee not. When
two days were past, repentance gat hold upon me and I knew that
the fault was with me; but penitence availed me not, and I abode
for some days weeping for thy loss, till what was in my hand
failed and I was obliged to beg my bread. So I fell to begging of
all, from the courted rich to the contemned poor, and since thou
leftest me, I have eaten of the bitterness of beggary and have been
in the sorriest of conditions. Every night I sat beweeping our
separation and that which I suffered, since thy departure, of
humiliation and ignominy, of abjection and misery.” And she
went on to tell him what had befallen her, whilst he stared at her
in amazement, till she said, “Yesterday, I went about begging all
day but none gave me aught; and as often as I accosted any one
and craved of him a crust of bread, he reviled me and gave me
naught. When night came, I went to bed supperless, and hunger
burned me and sore on me was that which I suffered: and I sat
weeping when, behold, one appeared to me and said, O woman
why weepest thou? Said I, erst I had a husband who used to
provide for me and fulfil my wishes; but he is lost to me and I
know not whither he went and have been in sore straits since he
left me. Asked he, What is thy husband’s name? and I answered,
His name is Ma’aruf. Quoth he, I ken him. Know that thy
husband is now Sultan in a certain city, and if thou wilt, I will
carry thee to him. Cried I, I am under thy protection: of thy
bounty bring me to him! So he took me up and flew with me
between heaven and earth, till he brought me to this pavilion and
said to me:—Enter yonder chamber, and thou shalt see thy
husband asleep on the couch. Accordingly I entered and found
thee in this state of lordship. Indeed I had not thought thou
wouldst forsake me, who am thy mate, and praised be Allah
who hath united thee with me!” Quoth Ma’aruf, “Did I forsake
thee or thou me? Thou complainedst of me from Kazi to
Kazi and endedst by denouncing me to the High Court and
bringing down on me Abú Tabak from the Citadel: so I fled
in mine own despite.” And he went on to tell her all that had
befallen him and how he was become Sultan and had married
the King’s daughter and how his beloved Dunya had died,
leaving him a son who was then seven years old. She
rejoined, “That which happened was fore-ordained of Allah;
but I repent me and I place myself under thy protection
beseeching thee not to abandon me, but suffer me eat bread, with
thee by way of an alms.” And she ceased not to humble herself
to him and to supplicate him till his heart relented towards her
and he said, “Repent from mischief and abide with me, and naught
shall betide thee save what shall pleasure thee: but, an thou work
any wickedness, I will slay thee nor fear any one. And fancy not
that thou canst complain of me to the High Court and that Abu
Tabak will come down on me from the Citadel; for I am become
Sultan and the folk dread me: but I fear none save Allah Almighty,
because I have a talismanic ring which when I rub, the Slave of
the Signet appeareth to me. His name is Abu al-Sa’adat, and
whatsoever I demand of him he bringeth to me. So, an thou
desire to return to thine own country, I will give thee what shall
suffice thee all thy life long and will send thee thither speedily;
but, an thou desire to abide with me, I will clear for thee a palace
and furnish it with the choicest of silks and appoint thee twenty
slave-girls to serve thee and provide thee with dainty dishes and
sumptuous suits, and thou shalt be a Queen and live in all delight
till thou die or I die. What sayest thou of this?” “I wish to
abide with thee,” she answered and kissed his hand and vowed
repentance from frowardness. Accordingly he set apart a palace
for her sole use and gave her slave-girls and eunuchs, and she
became a Queen. The young Prince used to visit her as he visited
his sire; but she hated him for that he was not her son; and
when the boy saw that she looked on him with the eye of aversion
and anger, he shunned her and took a dislike to her. As
for Ma’aruf, he occupied himself with the love of fair handmaidens
and bethought him not of his wife Fatimah the Dung,
for that she was grown a grizzled old fright, foul-favoured to the
sight, a bald-headed blight, loathlier than the snake speckled black
and white; the more that she had beyond measure evil entreated
him aforetime; and as saith the adage, “Ill-usage the root of
desire disparts and sows hate in the soil of hearts;” and God-gifted
is he who saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Beware of losing hearts of men by thine injurious deed; ✿ For when Aversion takes his place none may dear Love restore:</div>
      <div class="line">Hearts, when affection flies from them, are likest unto glass ✿ Which broken, cannot whole be made,—’tis breached for evermore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And indeed Ma’aruf had not given her shelter by reason of any
praiseworthy quality in her, but he dealt with her thus generously
only of desire for the approval of Allah Almighty.—Here Dunyazad
interrupted her sister Shahrazad, saying, “How winsome are
these words of thine which win hold of the heart more forcibly
than enchanters’ eyne; and how beautiful are these wondrous
books thou hast cited and the marvellous and singular tales thou
hast recited!” Quoth Shahrazad, “And where is all this compared
with what I shall relate to thee on the coming night, an I
live and the King deign spare my days?” So when morning
morrowed and the day brake in its sheen and shone, the King
arose from his couch with breast broadened and in high expectation
for the rest of the tale and saying, “By Allah, I will not
slay her till I hear the last of her story;” repaired to his Durbár
while the Wazir, as was his wont, presented himself at the Palace,
shroud under arm. Shahriyar tarried abroad all that day,
bidding and forbidding between man and man; after which he
returned to his Harim and, according to his custom went in to his
wife Shahrazad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4692" id="noteref-4692" epub:type="noteref">4692</a></p>

    <div>Now when it was the Thousand and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her sister, “Do thou finish for us the History of
Ma’aruf!” She replied, “With love and goodly gree, an my lord
deign permit me recount it.” Quoth the King, “I permit thee;
for that I am fain of hearing it.” So she said:—It hath reached
me, O auspicious King, that Ma’aruf would have naught to do
with his wife by way of conjugal duty. Now when she saw
that he held aloof from her bed and occupied himself with other
women, she hated him and jealousy gat the mastery of her and
Iblis prompted her to take the seal-ring from him and slay him
and make herself Queen in his stead. So she went forth one
night from her pavilion, intending for that in which was her
husband King Ma’aruf; and it chanced by decree of the Decreer
and His written destiny, that Ma’aruf lay that night with one of
his concubines; a damsel endowed with beauty and loveliness,
symmetry and a stature all grace. And it was his wont, of the
excellence of his piety, that, when he was minded to have to lie
with a woman, he would doff the enchanted seal-ring from his
finger, in reverence to the Holy Names graven thereon, and lay it
on the pillow, nor would he don it again till he had purified himself
by the Ghusl-ablution. Moreover, when he had lain with a
woman, he was used to order her go forth from him before daybreak,
of his fear for the seal-ring; and when he went to the
Hammam he locked the door of the pavilion till his return,
when he put on the ring, and after this, all were free to enter
according to custom. His wife Fatimah the Dung knew of all
this and went not forth from her place till she had certified
herself of the case. So she sallied out, when the night was
dark, purposing to go in to him, whilst he was drowned in sleep,
and steal the ring, unseen of him. Now it chanced at this time
that the King’s son had gone out, without light, to the Chapel of
Ease for an occasion, and sat down over the marble slab<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4693" id="noteref-4693" epub:type="noteref">4693</a> of the
jakes in the dark, leaving the door open. Presently, he saw
Fatimah come forth of her pavilion and make stealthily for that of
his father and said in himself, “What aileth this witch to leave her
lodging in the dead of the night and make for my father’s pavilion?
Needs must there be some reason for this:” so he went out after
her and followed in her steps unseen of her. Now he had a short
sword of watered steel, which he held so dear that he went not to
his father’s Divan, except he were girt therewith; and his father
used to laugh at him and exclaim, “Mahallah!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4694" id="noteref-4694" epub:type="noteref">4694</a> This is a mighty
fine sword of thine, O my son! But thou hast not gone down
with it to battle nor cut off a head therewith.” Whereupon the
boy would reply, “I will not fail to cut off with it some head which
deserveth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4695" id="noteref-4695" epub:type="noteref">4695</a> cutting.” And Ma’aruf would laugh at his words.
Now when treading in her track, he drew the sword from its
sheath and he followed her till she came to his father’s pavilion and
entered, whilst he stood and watched her from the door. He saw
her searching about and heard her say to herself, “Where hath he
laid the seal-ring?”; whereby he knew that she was looking for
the ring and he waited till she found it and said, “Here it is.”
Then she picked it up and turned to go out; but he hid behind
the door. As she came forth, she looked at the ring and turned it
about in her grasp. But when she was about to rub it, he raised
his hand with the sword and smote her on the neck; and she cried
a single cry and fell down dead. With this Ma’aruf awoke and
seeing his wife strown on the ground, with her blood flowing, and
his son standing with the drawn sword in his hand, said to him,
“What is this, O my son?” He replied, “O my father, how often
hast thou said to me, Thou hast a mighty fine sword; but thou
hast not gone down with it to battle nor cut off a head. And I
have answered thee, saying, I will not fail to cut off with it a head
which deserveth cutting. And now, behold, I have therewith cut
off for thee a head well worth the cutting!” And he told him
what had passed. Ma’aruf sought for the Seal-ring, but found it
not; so he searched the dead woman’s body till he saw her hand
closed upon it; whereupon he took it from her grasp and said to
the boy, “Thou art indeed my very son, without doubt or dispute;
Allah ease thee in this world and the next, even as thou hast eased
me of this vile woman! Her attempt led only to her own destruction,
and Allah-gifted is he who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When forwards Allah’s aid a man’s intent, ✿ His wish in every case shall find consent:</div>
      <div class="line">But an that aid of Allah be refused, ✿ His first attempt shall do him damagement.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then King Ma’aruf called aloud to some of his attendants, who
came in haste, and he told them what his wife Fatimah the Dung
had done and bade them to take her and lay her in a place till the
morning. They did his bidding, and next day he gave her in
charge to a number of eunuchs, who washed her and shrouded her
and made her a tomb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4696" id="noteref-4696" epub:type="noteref">4696</a> and buried her. Thus her coming from
Cairo was but to her grave, and Allah-gifted is he who said<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4697" id="noteref-4697" epub:type="noteref">4697</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">We trod the steps appointed for us: and he whose steps are appointed must tread them.</div>
      <div class="line">He whose death is decreed to take place in our land shall not die in any land but that.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And how excellent is the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I wot not, whenas to a land I fare, ✿ Good luck pursuing, what my lot shall be.</div>
      <div class="line">Whether the fortune I perforce pursue ✿ Or the misfortune which pursueth me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After this, King Ma’aruf sent for the husbandman, whose guest he
had been, when he was a fugitive, and made him his Wazir of the
Right and his Chief Counsellor.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4698" id="noteref-4698" epub:type="noteref">4698</a> Then, learning that he had a
daughter of passing beauty and loveliness, of qualities nature-ennobled
at birth and exalted of worth, he took her to wife; and
in due time he married his son. So they abode awhile in all solace
of life and its delight and their days were serene and their joys
untroubled, till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and
the Sunderer of societies, the Depopulator of populous places and
the Orphaner of sons and daughters. And glory be to the Living
who dieth not and in whose hand are the Keys of the Seen and the
Unseen!”</p>
