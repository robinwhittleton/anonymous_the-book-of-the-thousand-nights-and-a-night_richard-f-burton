			<h2 epub:type="title">Tale of Harun al-Rashid and Abu Hasan, the Merchant of Oman</h2>

<p class="c017">The Caliph Harun Al-Rashid was one night wakeful exceedingly;
so he called Masrur and said to him as soon as he came, “Fetch
me Ja’afar in haste.” Accordingly, he went out and returned
with the Wazir, to whom said the Caliph, “O Ja’afar wakefulness
hath mastered me this night and forbiddeth sleep from me, nor
wot I what shall drive it away from me.” Replied Ja’afar, “O
Commander of the Faithful, the wise say:—Looking on a mirror,
entering the Hammam-bath and hearkening unto song banish
care and chagrin.” He rejoined, “O Ja’afar I have done all this,
but it hath brought me naught of relief, and I swear by my pious
forbears unless thou contrive that which shall abate from me
this insomny, I will smite thy neck.” Quoth Ja’afar, “O Commander
of the Faithful, wilt thou do that which I shall counsel
thee?” whereupon quoth the Caliph, “And what is that thou
counselleth?” He replied, “It is that thou take boat with us
and drop down Tigris River with the tide to a place called Karn
al-Sirat, so haply we may hear what we never heard or see what
we never saw, for ’tis said:—The solace of care is in one of three
things; that a man see what he never before saw or hear what
he never yet heard or tread an earth he erst hath never trodden.
It may be this shall be the means of remedying thy restlessness,
O Commander of the Faithful, Inshallah! There, on either sides
of the river, are windows and balconies one facing other, and it
may be we shall hear or see from one of these somewhat wherewith
our hearts may be heartened.” Ja’afar’s counsel pleased
the Caliph, so he rose from his place and taking with him the
Wazir and his brother Al-Fazl and Isaac<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4311" id="noteref-4311" epub:type="noteref">4311</a> the boon-companion
and Abu Nowas and Abu Dalaf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4312" id="noteref-4312" epub:type="noteref">4312</a> and Masrur the Sworder——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Caliph arose from his seat with Ja’afar and the rest of the party,
all entered the wardrobe, where they donned merchant’s gear. Then
they went down to the Tigris and embarking in a gilded boat,
dropped down with the stream, till they came to the place they
sought, when they heard the voice of a damsel singing to the lute
and chanting these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To him when the wine cup is near I declare, ✿ While in coppice loud shrilleth and trilleth Hazár,</div>
      <div class="line">“How long this repining from joys and delight? ✿ Wake up for this life is a borrowed ware!”</div>
      <div class="line">Take the cup from the hand of the friend who is dear ✿ With languishing eyelids and languorous air.</div>
      <div class="line">I sowed on his cheek a fresh rose, which amid ✿ His side-locks the fruit of granado-tree bare.</div>
      <div class="line">Thou wouldst deem that the place where he tare his fair cheek<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4313" id="noteref-4313" epub:type="noteref">4313</a> ✿ Were ashes, while cheeks hues incendiary wear.</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth the blamer, “Forget him! But where’s my excuse ✿ When his side-face is growing the downiest hair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4314" id="noteref-4314" epub:type="noteref">4314</a>?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the Caliph heard this, he said, “O Ja’afar, how goodly is
that voice!”; and the Wazir replied, “O our lord, never smote
my hearing aught sweeter or goodlier than this singing! But,
good my lord, hearing from behind a wall is only half hearing;
how would it be an we heard it from behind a curtain?” Quoth
the Caliph, “Come, O Ja’afar, let us play the parasites with the
master of this house; and haply we shall look upon the songstress,
face to face;” and quoth Ja’afar, “I hear and I obey.” So
they landed and sought admittance; when behold, there came out
to them a young man, fair of favour, sweet of speech and fluent
of tongue, who said to them, “Well come and welcome, O lords
that honour me with your presence! Enter in all comfort and
convenience!” So they went in (and he with them) to a saloon
with four faces, whose ceiling was decorated with gold and its
walls adorned with ultramarine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4315" id="noteref-4315" epub:type="noteref">4315</a> At its upper end was a daïs,
whereon stood a goodly row of seats<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4316" id="noteref-4316" epub:type="noteref">4316</a> and thereon sat an hundred
damsels like moons. The house-master cried out to them and
they came down from their seats. Then he turned to Ja’afar and
said to him “O my lord, I know not the honourable of you from
the more honourable: Bismillah! deign he that is highest in rank
among you favour me by taking the head of the room, and let his
brethren sit each in his several stead.” So they sat down, each according
to his degree, whilst Masrur abode standing before them in
their service; and the host asked them, “O my guests, with your
leave, shall I set somewhat of food before you?” and they
answered, “Yes.” Hearing this he bade his handmaids bring
food, whereupon four damsels with girded waists placed in front
of them a table, whereon were rare meats of that which flieth
and walketh earth and swimmeth seas, sand-grouse and quails
and chickens and pigeons; and written on the raised edge of the
tray were verses such as sorted with the entertainment. So they
ate till they had enough and washed their hands, after which said
the young man, “O my lords, if you have any want, let us know
it, that we may have the honour of satisfying it.” They replied,
“’Tis well: we came not to thy dwelling save for the sake of a
voice we heard from behind the wall of thy house, and we would
fain hear it again and know her to whom it belongeth. So, an
thou deem right to vouchsafe us this favour, it will be of the
generosity of thy nature, and after we will return whence we
came.” Quoth the host, “Ye are welcome;” and, turning to a
black slave-girl, said to her, “Fetch me thy mistress such an
one.” So she went away and returning with a chair of chinaware,
cushioned with brocade, set it down: then withdrew again and
presently returned with a damsel, as she were the moon on the
night of its full, who sat down on the chair. Then the black girl
gave her a bag of satin wherefrom she brought out a lute, inlaid
with gems and jacinths and furnished with pegs of gold.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Forty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the damsel came forward, she took her seat upon the chair and
brought out from its case a lute and behold, it was inlaid with
gems and jacinths and furnished with pegs of gold. Then she
tuned its strings, even as saith the poet of her and her lute in these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She sits it in lap like a mother fond ✿ And she strikes the strings that can make it speak:</div>
      <div class="line">And ne’er smiteth her right an injurious touch ✿ But her left repairs of her right the wreak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4317" id="noteref-4317" epub:type="noteref">4317</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she strained the lute to her bosom, binding over it as mother
bendeth over babe, and swept the strings which complained as
child to mother complaineth; after which she played upon it and
began improvising these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An Time my lover restore me I’ll blame him fain, ✿ Saying, “Pass, O my dear, the bowl and in passing drain</div>
      <div class="line">The wine which hath never mixed with the heart of man ✿ But he passes to joy from annoy and to pleasure from pain.”</div>
      <div class="line">Then Zephyr arose to his task of sustaining the cup: ✿ Didst e’er see full Moon that in hand the star hath ta’en?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4318" id="noteref-4318" epub:type="noteref">4318</a></div>
      <div class="line">How oft I talked thro’ the night, when its rounded Lune ✿ Shed on darkness of Tigris ’bank a beamy rain!</div>
      <div class="line">And when Luna sank in the West ’twas as though she’d wave ✿ O’er the length of the watery waste a gilded glaive.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had made an end of her verse, she wept with sore weeping
and all who were in the place wept aloud till they were well-nigh
dead; nor was there one of them but took leave of his wits
and rent his raiment and beat his face, for the goodliness of her
singing. Then said Al-Rashid, “This damsel’s song verily denoteth
that she is a lover departed from her beloved.” Quoth her master,
“She hath lost father and mother;” but quoth the Caliph, “This
is not the weeping of one who hath lost mother and father,
but the yearning of one who hath lost him she loveth.” And he
was delighted with her singing and said to Isaac, “By Allah,
never saw I her like!”; and Isaac said, “O my lord, indeed I
marvel at her with utterest marvel and am beside myself for
delight.” Now Al-Rashid with all this stinted not to look upon
the house-master and note his charms and the daintiness of his
fashion; but he saw on his face a pallor as he would die; so he
turned to him and said, “Ho, youth!” and the other said,
“Adsum!—at thy service, O my lord,” The Caliph asked,
“Knowest thou who we are?”; and he answered, “No.” Quoth
Ja’afar, “Wilt thou that I tell thee the names of each of us?”;
and quoth the young man “Yes;” when the Wazir said, “This is
the Commander of the Faithful, descendant of the uncle of the
Prince of the Apostles,” and named to him the others of the company;
after which quoth Al-Rashid, “I wish that thou acquaint
me with the cause of the paleness of thy face, whether it be
acquired or natural from thy birth-tide.” Quoth he, “O Prince of
True Believers, my case is wondrous and my affair marvellous;
were it graven with gravers on the eye-corners it were a warner to
whoso will be warned.” Said the Caliph, “Tell it to me: haply
thy healing may be at my hand.” Said the young man, “O
Commander of the Faithful, lend me thine ears and give me thy
whole mind.” And he, “Come; tell it me, for thou makest me
long to hear it.” So the young man began:—Know then, O
Prince of True Believers, that I am a merchant of the merchants
of the sea and come from Oman city, where my sire was a trader
and a very wealthy trader having thirty ships trafficking upon the
main, whose yearly hire was thirty thousand dinars; and he was a
generous man and had taught me writing and all whereof a wight
hath need. When his last hour drew near, he called me to him
and gave me the customary charge; then Almighty Allah took
him and admitted him to His mercy and may He continue the
Commander of the Faithful on life! Now my late father had
partners trading with his coin and voyaging on the ocean. So one
day, as I sat in my house with a company of merchants, a certain
of my servants came in to me and said, “O my lord, there is at
the door a man who craveth admittance to thee!” I gave leave
and he came in, bearing on his head a something covered. He
set it down and uncovered it, and behold it was a box wherein
were fruits out of season and herbs conserved in salt and fresh,
such as are not found in our land. I thanked him and gifted him
with an hundred dinars, and he went away grateful. Then I
divided these things amongst my friends and guests who were
present and asked them whence they came. Quoth they, “They
come from Bassorah,” and praised them and went on to portray
the beauties of Bassorah and all agreed that there was naught in
the world goodlier than Baghdad and its people. Then they fell
to describing Baghdad and the fine manners of its folk and the
excellence of its air and the beauty of its ordinance, till my soul
longed for it and all my hopes clave to looking upon it. So I arose
and selling my houses and lands, ships and slaves, negroes and handmaids,
I got together my good, to wit, a thousand thousand dinars,
besides gems and jewels, wherewith I freighted a vessel and setting
out therein with the whole of the property, voyaged awhile. Then
I hired a barque and embarking therein with all my monies sailed
up the river some days till we arrived at Baghdad. I enquired
where the merchants abode and what part was pleasantest for
domicile and was answered, “The Karkh quarter.” So I went
thither and hiring a house in a thoroughfare called the Street of
Saffron, transported all my goods to it and took up my lodging
therein for some time. At last one day which was a Friday, I
sallied forth to solace myself taking with me somewhat of coin. I
went first to a cathedral-mosque, called the Mosque of Mansur,
where the Friday service was held, and when we had made an end
of congregational prayers, I fared forth with the folk to a place
hight Karn al-Sirat, where I saw a tall and goodly mansion, with
a balcony overlooking the river-bank and pierced with a lattice-window.
So I betook myself thither with a company of folk and
sighted there an old man sitting, handsomely clad and exhaling
perfumes. His beard forked upon his breast in two waves like
silver-wire, and about him were four damsels and five pages. So I
said to one of the folk, “What is the name of this old man and
what is his business?”; and the man said, “His name is Táhir
ibn al-Aláa, and he is a keeper of girls: all who go into him eat and
drink and look upon fair faces.” Quoth I, “By Allah, this long
while have I wandered about in search of something like this!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Forty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
young merchant cried, “By Allah this long while I have gone
about in search of something like this!” So I went up to the
Shaykh, O Commander of the Faithful, and saluting him said to
him, “O my lord, I need somewhat of thee!” He replied, “What
is thy need?” and I rejoined, “’Tis my desire to be thy guest to-night.”
He said, “With all my heart; but, O my son, with me are
many damsels, some whose night is ten dinars, some forty and
others more. Choose which thou wilt have.” Quoth I, “I
choose her whose night is ten dinars.” And I weighed out to him
three hundred dinars, the price of a month; whereupon he committed
me to a page, who carried me to a Hammam within the
house and served me with goodly service. When I came out of
the Bath he brought me to a chamber and knocked at the door,
whereupon out came a handmaid, to whom said he, “Take thy
guest!” She met me with welcome and cordiality, laughing and
rejoicing, and brought me into a mighty fine room decorated with
gold. I considered her and saw her like the moon on the night of
its fulness having in attendance on her two damsels as they were
constellations. She made me sit and seating herself by my side,
signed to her slave-girls who set before us a tray covered with
dishes of various kinds of meats, pullets and quails and sand-grouse
and pigeons. So we ate our sufficiency, and never in my
life ate I aught more delicious than this food. When we had eaten
she bade remove the tray and set on the service of wine and
flowers, sweetmeats and fruits; and I abode with her a month in
such case. At the end of that time, I repaired to the Bath; then,
going to the old man, I said to him, “O my lord, I want her whose
night is twenty dinars.” “Weigh down the gold,” said he. So I
fetched money and weighed out to him six hundred dinars for a
month’s hire, whereupon he called a page and said to him, “Take
thy lord here.” Accordingly he carried me to the Hammam and
thence to the door of a chamber, whereat he knocked and there
came out a handmaid, to whom quoth he, “Take thy guest!” She
received me with the goodliest reception and I found in attendance
on her four slave-girls, whom she commanded to bring food. So
they fetched a tray spread with all manner meats, and I ate.
When I had made an end of eating and the tray had been
removed, she took the lute and sang thereto these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O waftings of musk from the Babel-land! ✿ Bear a message from me which my longings have planned:</div>
      <div class="line">My troth is pledged to that place of yours, ✿ And to friends there ’biding—a noble band;</div>
      <div class="line">And wherein dwells she whom all lovers love ✿ And would hend, but she cometh to no man’s hand.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I abode with her a month, after which I returned to the Shaykh
and said to him, “I want the forty dinar one.” “Weigh out the
money,” said he. So I weighed out to him twelve hundred dinars,
the mensual hire, and abode with her one month as it were one day,
for what I saw of the comeliness of her semblance and the goodliness
of her converse. After this I went to the Shaykh one evening
and heard a great noise and loud voices; so I asked him, “What
is to do?”; and he answered, saying, “This is the night of our
remarkablest nights, when all souls embark on the river and divert
themselves by gazing one upon other. Hast thou a mind to go up
to the roof and solace thyself by looking at the folk?” “Yes,”
answered I, and went up to the terrace-roof,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4319" id="noteref-4319" epub:type="noteref">4319</a> whence I could see a
gathering of people with flambeaux and cressets, and great mirth
and merriment. Then I went up to the end of the roof and beheld
there, behind a goodly curtain, a little chamber in whose midst
stood a couch of juniper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4320" id="noteref-4320" epub:type="noteref">4320</a>-wood plated with shimmering gold and
covered with a handsome carpet. On this sat a lovely young lady,
confounding all beholders with her beauty and comeliness and
symmetry and perfect grace, and by her side a youth, whose hand
was on her neck; and he was kissing her and she kissing him.
When I saw them, O Prince of True Believers, I could not contain
myself nor knew where I was, so dazed and dazzled was I by her
beauty: but, when I came down, I questioned the damsel with
whom I was and described the young lady to her. “What wilt
thou with her?” asked she; and I, “She hath taken my wit.” “O
Abu al-Hasan, hast thou a mind to her?” “Ay, by Allah! for
she hath captivated my heart and soul.” “This is the daughter of
Tahir ibn al-Alaa; she is our mistress and we are all her handmaids;
but knowest thou, O Abu al-Hasan, what be the price of
her night and her day?” “No!” “Five hundred dinars, for she
is a regret to the heart of Kings!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4321" id="noteref-4321" epub:type="noteref">4321</a> “By Allah, I will spend all I
have on this damsel!” So saying I lay, heartsore for desire,
through the livelong night till the morning, when I repaired to the
Hammam and presently donned a suit of the richest royal raiment
and betaking myself to Ibn al-Alaa, said to him, “O my lord, I
want her whose night is five hundred dinars.” Quoth he, “Weigh
down the money.” So I weighed out to him fifteen thousand
dinars for a month’s hire and he took them and said to the page,
“Carry him to thy mistress such an one!” Accordingly he took
me and carried me to an apartment, than which my eyes never saw
a goodlier on the earth’s face and there I found the young lady
seated. When I saw her, O Commander of the Faithful, my reason
was confounded with her beauty, for she was like the full moon on
its fourteenth night,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Fiftieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
young man continued to describe before the Prince of True
Believers the young lady’s characteristics, saying:—She was like
the full moon on her fourteenth night, a model of grace and
symmetry and loveliness. Her speech shamed the tones of the
lute, and it was as it were she whom the poet meant in these
verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She cried while played in her side Desire, ✿ And Night o’er hung her with blackest blee:—</div>
      <div class="line">“O Night shall thy murk bring me ne’er a chum ✿ To tumble and futter this coynte of me?”</div>
      <div class="line">And she smote that part with her palm and sighed ✿ Sore sighs and a weeping continued she:—</div>
      <div class="line">“As the toothstick beautifies teeth e’en so ✿ Must prickle to coynte as a toothstick be.</div>
      <div class="line">O Moslems, is never a stand to your tools, ✿ To assist a woman’s necessity?”</div>
      <div class="line">Thereat rose upstanding beneath its clothes ✿ My yard, as crying, “At thee! at thee!”</div>
      <div class="line">And I loosed her trouser-string, startling her: ✿ “Who art thou?” and I said, “A reply to thy plea!”</div>
      <div class="line">And began to stroke her with wrist-thick yard, ✿ Hurting hinder cheeks by its potency:</div>
      <div class="line">And she cried as I rose after courses three ✿ “Suit thy gree the stroke!” and I—“suit thy gree!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And how excellent is the saying of another!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4322" id="noteref-4322" epub:type="noteref">4322</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A fair one, to idolaters if she her face should show, They’d leave their idols and her face for only Lord would know.</div>
      <div class="line">If in the Eastward she appeared unto a monk, for sure, He’d cease from turning to the West and to the East bend low;</div>
      <div class="line">And if into the briny sea one day she chanced to spit, Assuredly the salt sea’s floods straight fresh and sweet would grow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And that of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I looked at her one look and that dazed me ✿ Such rarest gifts of mind and form to see,</div>
      <div class="line">When doubt inspired her that I loved her, and ✿ Upon her cheeks the doubt showed showily.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>I saluted her and she said to me, “Well come and welcome, and
fair welcome!”; and taking me by the hand, O Prince of True
Believers, made me sit down by her side; whereupon, of the
excess of my desire, I fell a-weeping for fear of severance and
pouring forth the tears of the eye, recited these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I love the nights of parting though I joy not in the same ✿ Time haply may exchange them for the boons of Union-day:</div>
      <div class="line">And the days that bring Union I unlove for single thought, ✿ Seeing everything in life lacking steadfastness of stay.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she strave to solace me with soft sweet speech, but I was
drowned in the deeps of passion, fearing even in union the pangs
of disunion, for excess of longing and ecstasy of passion; and I
bethought me of the lowe of absence and estrangement and
repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>I thought of estrangement in her embrace      ✿ And my eyes rained tears red as ’Andam-wood.</div>
    <div>So I wiped the drops on that long white neck; ✿ For camphor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4323" id="noteref-4323" epub:type="noteref">4323</a> is wont to stay flow of blood.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then she bade bring food and there came four damsels, high-bosomed
girls and virginal, who set before us food and fruits and
confections and flowers and wine, such as befit none save kings.
So, O Commander of the Faithful, we ate, and sat over our wine,
compassed about with blooms and herbs of sweet savour, in a
chamber suitable only for kings. Presently, one of her maids
brought her a silken bag, which she opened and taking thereout
a lute, laid it in her lap and smote its strings, whereat it complained
as child complaineth to mother, and she sang these two
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Drink not pure wine except from hand of slender youth ✿ Like wine for daintiness and like him eke the wine:</div>
      <div class="line">For wine no joyance brings to him who drains the cup ✿ Save bring the cup-boy cheek as fair and fain and fine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So, I abode with her, O Commander of the Faithful, month after
month in similar guise, till all my money was spent; wherefore I
began to bethink me of separation as I sat with her one day and
my tears railed down upon my cheeks like rills, and I became not
knowing night from light. Quoth she, “Why dost thou weep?”;
and quoth I, “O light of mine eyes, I weep because of our
parting.” She asked, “And what shall part me and thee, O my
lord?”; and I answered, “By Allah, O my lady, from the day I
came to thee, thy father hath taken of me, for every night, five
hundred dinars, and now I have nothing left. Right soothfast is
the saw:—Penury maketh strangerhood at home and money
maketh a home in strangerhood; and indeed the poet speaks
truth when he saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Lack of good is exile to man at home; ✿ And money shall house him where’er he roam.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She replied, “Know that it is my father’s custom, whenever a
merchant abideth with him and hath spent all his capital, to
entertain him three days; then doth he put him out and he may
return to us nevermore. But keep thou thy secret and conceal
thy case and I will so contrive that thou shalt abide with me till
such time as Allah will;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4324" id="noteref-4324" epub:type="noteref">4324</a> for, indeed, there is in my heart a great
love for thee. Thou must know that all my father’s money is
under my hand and he wotteth not its full tale; so, every morning,
I will give thee a purse of five hundred dinars which do thou offer
to my sire, saying:—Henceforth, I will pay thee only day by
day. He will hand the sum to me, and I will give it to thee
again, and we will abide thus till such time as may please Allah.”<a href="#f289" class="c015"><sup>[289]</sup></a>
Thereupon I thanked her and kissed her hand; and on this wise,
O Prince of True Believers, I abode with her a whole year, till it
chanced on a certain day that she beat one of her handmaids
grievously and the slave-girl said, “By Allah, I will assuredly
torture thy heart, even as thou hast tortured me!” So she went
to the girl’s father and exposed to him all that had passed, first
and last, which when Tahir ibn Alaa heard he arose forthright and
coming in to me, as I sat with his daughter, said, “Ho, such an
one!”; and I said, “At thy service.” Quoth he, “’Tis our wont,
when a merchant grow poor with us, to give him hospitality three
days; but thou hast had a year with us, eating and drinking and
doing what thou wouldst.” Then he turned to his pages and cried
to them, “Pull off his clothes.” They did as he bade them and
gave me ten dirhams and an old suit worth five silvers; after
which he said to me, “Go forth; I will not beat thee nor abuse
thee; but wend thy ways and if thou tarry in this town, thy blood
be upon thine own head.” So I went forth, O Commander of the
Faithful, in my own despite, knowing not whither to hie, for had
fallen on my heart all the trouble in the world and I was occupied
with sad thought and doubt. Then I bethought me of the wealth
which I had brought from Oman and said in myself, “I came
hither with a thousand thousand dinars, part price of thirty ships,
and have made away with it all in the house of yonder ill-omened
man, and now I go forth from him, bare and broken-hearted! But
there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” Then I abode three days in Baghdad,
without tasting meat or drink, and on the fourth day seeing a ship
bound for Bassorah, I took passage in her of the owner, and when
we reached our port, I landed and went into the bazar, being sore
anhungered. Presently, a man saw me, a grocer, whom I had
known aforetime, and coming up to me, embraced me, for he had
been my friend and my father’s friend before me. Then he questioned
me of my case, seeing me clad in those tattered clothes;
so I told him all that had befallen me, and he said, “By Allah,
this is not the act of a sensible man! But after this that hath
befallen thee what dost thou purpose to do?” Quoth I, “I know
not what I shall do,” and quoth he, “Wilt thou abide with me
and write my outgo and income and thou shalt have two dirhams
a day, over and above thy food and drink?” I agreed to this and
abode with him, O Prince of True Believers, selling and buying,
till I had gotten an hundred dinars; when I hired me an upper
chamber by the river-side, so haply a ship should come up with
merchandise, that I might buy goods with the dinars and go back
with them to Baghdad. Now it fortuned that one day, there came
ships with merchandise, and all the merchants resorted to them to
buy, and I went with them on board, when behold, there came
two men out of the hold and setting themselves chairs on the
deck, sat down thereon. The merchants addressed themselves to
the twain with intent to buy, and the man said to one of the crew,
“Bring the carpet.” Accordingly he brought the carpet and
spread it, and another came with a pair of saddle-bags, whence
he took a budget and emptied it on the carpet; and our sights
were dazzled with that which issued therefrom of pearls and corals
and jacinths and carnelians and other jewels of all sorts and
colours.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Fifty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the young
merchant, after recounting to the Caliph the matter of the bag and
its containing jewels of all sorts, continued:—Presently, O Commander
of the Faithful, said one of the men on the chairs, “O company
of merchants, we will sell but this to-day, by way of spending-money,
for that we are weary.” So the merchants fell to bidding
one against other for the jewels and bid till the price reached four
hundred dinars. Then said to me the owner of the bag (for he
was an old acquaintance of mine, and when he saw me, he came
down to me and saluted me), “Why dost thou not speak and bid
like the rest of the merchants?” I said, “O my lord, by Allah,
the shifts of fortune have run against me and I have lost my
wealth and have only an hundred dinars left in the world.”
Quoth he, “O Ománi, after this vast wealth, can only an
hundred dinars remain to thee?” And I was abashed before
him and my eyes filled with tears; whereupon he looked
at me and indeed my case was grievous to him. So he said
to the merchants, “Bear witness against me that I have sold
all that is in this bag of various gems and precious stones to
this man for an hundred gold pieces, albeit I know them to be
worth so many thousand dinars, and this is a present from
me to him.” Then he gave me the saddle-bag and the carpet,
with all the jewels that were thereon, for which I thanked him, and
each and every of the merchants present praised him. Presently
I carried all this to the jewel-market and sat there to sell and buy.
Now among the precious stones was a round amulet of the handiwork
of the masters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4325" id="noteref-4325" epub:type="noteref">4325</a> weighing half a pound: it was red of the
brightest, a carnelian on both whose sides were graven characts
and characters, like the tracks of ants; but I knew not its worth.
I sold and bought a whole year, at the end of which I took the
amulet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4326" id="noteref-4326" epub:type="noteref">4326</a> and said, “This hath been with me some while, and I
know not what it is nor what may be its value.” So I gave it to
the broker who took it and went round with it and returned, saying,
“None of the merchants will give me more than ten dirhams for
it.” Quoth I, “I will not sell it at that price;” and he threw it in
my face and went away. Another day I again offered it for sale
and its price reached fifteen dirhams; whereupon I took it from
the broker in anger and threw it back into the tray. But a few
days after, as I sat in my shop, there came up to me a man, who
bore the traces of travel, and saluting me, said, “By thy leave, I
will turn over what thou hast of wares.” Said I, “’Tis well,” and
indeed, O Commander of the Faithful, I was still wroth by reason
of the lack of demand for the talisman. So the man fell to turning
over my wares, but took nought thereof save the amulet, which
when he saw, he kissed his hand and cried, “Praised be Allah!”
Then said he to me, “O my lord, wilt thou sell this?”; and I
replied, “Yes,” being still angry. Quoth he, “What is its price?”
And I asked, “How much wilt thou give?” He answered,
“Twenty dinars”: so I thought he was making mock of me and
exclaimed, “Wend thy ways.” But he resumed, “I will give thee
fifty dinars for it.” I made him no answer, and he continued, “A
thousand dinars.” But I was silent, declining to reply, whilst he
laughed at my silence and said, “Why dost thou not return me an
answer?” “Hie thee home,” repeated I and was like to quarrel
with him. But he bid thousand after thousand, and I still made
him no reply, till he said, “Wilt thou sell it for twenty thousand
dinars?” I still thought he was mocking me; but the people
gathered about me and all of them said, “Sell to him, and if he
buy not, we will all up and at him and drub him and thrust him
forth the city.” So quoth I to him, “Wilt thou buy or dost thou
jest?”; and quoth he, “Wilt thou sell or dost thou joke?” I said,
“I will sell if thou wilt buy;” then he said, “I will buy it for
thirty thousand dinars; take them and make the bargain;” so I
cried to the bystanders, “Bear witness against him,” adding to
him, “But on condition that thou acquaint me with the virtues and
profit of this amulet for which thou payest all this money.” He
answered, “Close the bargain, and I will tell thee this;” I rejoined,
“I sell it to thee;” and he retorted, “Allah be witness of that
which thou sayst and testimony!” Then he brought out the
gold and giving it to me took the amulet, and set it in his bosom;
after which he turned to me and asked, “Art thou content?”
Answered I, “Yes,” and he said to the people, “Bear witness
against him that he hath closed the bargain and touched the price,
thirty thousand dinars.” Then he turned to me and said, “Harkye,
my poor fellow, hadst thou held back from selling, by Allah I
would have bidden thee up to an hundred thousand dinars, nay,
even to a thousand thousand!” When I heard these words, O
Commander of the Faithful, the blood fled my face, and from that
day there overcame it this pallor thou seest. Then said I to him,
“Tell me the reason of this and what is the use of this amulet.”
And he answered, saying, “Know that the King of Hind hath
a daughter, never was seen a thing fairer than she, and she is
possessed with a falling sickness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4327" id="noteref-4327" epub:type="noteref">4327</a>” So the King summoned the
Scribes and men of science and Divines, but none of them could
relieve her of this. Now I was present in the assembly; so I said
to him, “O King, I know a man called Sa’adu’lláh the Babylonian,
than whom there is not on the face of the earth one more masterly
in these matters, and if thou see fit to send me to him, do so.”
Said he, “Go to him;” and quoth I, “Bring me a piece of
carnelian.” Accordingly he gave me a great piece of carnelian
and an hundred thousand dinars and a present, which I took, and
with which I betook myself to the land of Babel. Then I sought
out the Shaykh and when he was shown to me I delivered to him
the money and the present, which he accepted and sending for a
lapidary, bade him fashion the carnelian into this amulet. Then
he abode seven months in observation of the stars, till he chose
out an auspicious time for engraving it, when he graved upon it
these talismanic characters which thou seest, and I took it and
returned with it to the King.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Fifty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
young man said to the Commander of the Faithful:—So after the
Shaykh had spoken, I took this talisman and returned with it to
the King. Now the Princess was bound with four chains, and
every night a slave-girl lay with her and was found in the morning
with her throat cut. The King took the amulet and laid it upon
his daughter who was straightway made whole. At this he
rejoiced with exceeding joy and invested me with a vest of honour
and gave alms of much money; and he caused set the amulet in
the Princess’s necklace. It chanced, one day, that she embarked
with her women in a ship and went for a sail on the sea. Presently,
one of her maids put out her hand to her, to sport with her, and
the necklace brake asunder and fell into the waves. From that
hour the possessor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4328" id="noteref-4328" epub:type="noteref">4328</a> of the Princess returned to her, wherefore
great grief betided the King and he gave me much money, saying,
“Go thou to Shaykh Sa’adu’llah and let him make her another
amulet, in lieu of that which is lost.” I journeyed to Babel,
but found the old man dead; whereupon I returned and told the
King, who sent me and ten others to go round about in all
countries, so haply we might find a remedy for her: and now Allah
hath caused me happen on it with thee.” Saying these words, he
took from me the amulet, O Commander of the Faithful, and went
his ways. Such, then, is the cause of the wanness of my complexion.
As for me, I repaired to Baghdad, carrying all my wealth
with me, and took up my abode in the lodgings where I lived
whilome. On the morrow, as soon as it was light, I donned my
dress and betook myself to the house of Tahir ibn al-Alaa, that
haply I might see her whom I loved, for the love of her had never
ceased to increase upon my heart. But when I came to his home,
I saw the balcony broken down and the lattice builded up; so I
stood awhile, pondering my case and the shifts of Time, till there
came up a serving-man, and I questioned him, saying, “What hath
God done with Tahir ibn al-Alaa?” He answered, “O my brother,
he hath repented to Almighty Allah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4329" id="noteref-4329" epub:type="noteref">4329</a>” Quoth I, “What was the
cause of his repentance?”; and quoth he, “O my brother, in such
a year there came to him a merchant, by name Abu al-Hasan the
Omani, who abode with his daughter awhile, till his wealth was all
spent, when the old man turned him out, broken-hearted. Now
the girl loved him with exceeding love, and when she was parted
from him, she sickened of a sore sickness and came nigh upon
death. As soon as her father knew how it was with her, he sent
after and sought for Abu al-Hasan through the lands, pledging
himself to bestow upon whoso should produce him an hundred
thousand dinars; but none could find him nor come on any trace
of him; and she is now hard upon death.” Quoth I, “And how
is it with her sire?” and quoth the servant, “He hath sold all his
girls, for grief of that which hath befallen him, and hath repented
to Almighty Allah.” Then asked I, “What wouldst thou say to
him who should direct thee to Abu al-Hasan the Omani?”; and
he answered, “Allah upon thee, O my brother, that thou do this
and quicken my poverty and the poverty of my parents<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4330" id="noteref-4330" epub:type="noteref">4330</a>!” I
rejoined, “Go to her father and say to him, Thou owest me the
reward for good news, for that Abu al-Hasan the Omani standeth
at the door.” With this he set off trotting, as he were a mule
loosed from the mill, and presently came back, accompanied by
Shaykh Tahir himself, who no sooner saw me than he returned to
his house and gave the man an hundred thousand dinars which he
took and went away blessing me. Then the old man came up and
embraced me and wept, saying, “O my lord, where hast thou been
absent all this while? Indeed, my daughter hath been killed by
reason of her separation from thee; but come with me into the
house.” So we entered and he prostrated himself in gratitude to
the Almighty, saying, “Praised be Allah who hath reunited us
with thee!” Then he went in to his daughter and said to her,
“The Lord hath healed thee of this sickness;” and said she, “O
my papa, I shall never be whole of my sickness, save I look upon
the face of Abu al-Hasan.” Quoth he, “An thou wilt eat a morsel
and go to the Hammam, I will bring thee in company with him.”
Asked she, “Is it true that thou sayst?”; and he answered, “By
the Great God, ’tis true!” She rejoined, “By Allah, if I look
upon his face, I shall have no need of eating!” Then said he to
his page, “Bring in thy lord.” Thereupon I entered, and when
she saw me, O Prince of True Believers, she fell down in a swoon,
and presently coming to herself, recited this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Yea, Allah hath joinèd the parted twain, ✿ When no thought they thought e’er to meet again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she sat upright and said, “By Allah, O my lord, I had not
deemed to see thy face ever more, save it were in a dream!” So
she embraced me and wept, and said, “O Abu al-Hasan, now will
I eat and drink.” The old man her sire rejoiced to hear these
words and they brought her meat and drink and we ate and drank,
O Commander of the Faithful. After this, I abode with them
awhile, till she was restored to her former beauty, when her father
sent for the Kazi and the witnesses and bade write out the
marriage-contract between her and me and made a mighty great
bride-feast; and she is my wife to this day and this is my son by
her.” So saying he went away and returned with a boy of rare
beauty and symmetry of form and favour to whom said he, “Kiss
the ground before the Commander of the Faithful.” He kissed
ground before the Caliph, who marvelled at his beauty and glorified
his Creator; after which Al-Rashid departed, he and his company,
saying, “O Ja’afar, verily, this is none other than a marvellous thing,
never saw I nor heard I aught more wondrous.” When he was
seated in the palace of the Caliphate, he cried, “O Masrur!” who
replied, “Here am I, O my lord!” Then said he, “Bring the
year’s tribute of Bassorah and Baghdad and Khorasan, and set it
in this recess.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4331" id="noteref-4331" epub:type="noteref">4331</a>” Accordingly he laid the three tributes together
and they were a vast sum of money, whose tale none might tell
save Allah. Then the Caliph bade draw a curtain before the
recess and said to Ja’afar, “Fetch me Abu al-Hasan.” Replied
Ja’afar, “I hear and obey,” and going forth, returned presently
with the Omani, who kissed ground before the Caliph, fearing lest
he had sent for him because of some fault that he had committed
when he was with him in his house. Then said Al-Rashid,
“Harkye, O Omani!” and he replied, “Adsum, O Prince of True
Believers! May Allah ever bestow his favours upon thee!”
Quoth the Caliph, “Draw back yonder curtain.” Thereupon
Abu al-Hasan drew back the curtain from the recess and
was confounded and perplexed at the mass of money he saw
there. Said Al-Rashid, “O Abu al-Hasan, whether is the more,
this money or that thou didst lose by the amulet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4332" id="noteref-4332" epub:type="noteref">4332</a>?”; and he
answered, “This is many times the greater, O Commander of the
Faithful!” Quoth the Caliph, “Bear witness, all ye who are
present, that I give this money to this young man.” So Abu
al-Hasan kissed ground and was abashed and wept before the
Caliph for excess of joy. Now when he wept, the tears ran down
from his eyelids upon his cheeks and the blood returned to its
place and his face became like the moon on the night of its
fulness. Whereupon quoth the Caliph, “There is no god but <em>the</em>
God! Glory be to Him who decreeth change upon change and
is Himself the Everlasting who changeth not!” Saying these
words, he bade fetch a mirror and showed Abu al-Hasan his face
therein, which when he saw, he prostrated himself, in gratitude to
the Most High Lord. Then the Caliph bade transport the money
to Abu al-Hasan’s house and charged the young man not to absent
himself from him, so he might enjoy his company as a cup-companion.
Accordingly he paid him frequent visits, till Al-Rashid
departed to the mercy of Almighty Allah; and glory be to Him
who dieth not the Lord of the Seen and the Unseen! And among
tales they tell is one touching</p>
