			<p>This volume has been entitled “The New Arabian Nights,” a name now hackneyed because applied to its contents as far back as 1819 in Henry Weber’s “Tales of the East,” (Edinburgh, Ballantyne).</p>
			<p>The original <abbr>MS.</abbr> was brought to France by Al-Káhin Diyúnisiús Sháwísh, a Syrian priest of the Congregation of <abbr>St.</abbr> Basil, whose name has been Frenchified to Don Dennis (or Denys) Chavis. He was a student at the European College of Al-Kadís Ithanásiús (<abbr>St.</abbr> Athanasius) in Rúmiyah the Grand (Constantinople) and was summoned by the Minister of State, Baron de Breteuil, to Paris, where he presently became “Teacher of the Arabic Tongue at the College of the Sultán, King of Fransá in Bárís (Paris) the Great.” He undertook (probably to supply the loss of Galland’s <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> <abbr>MS.</abbr> volume) a continuation of The Nights (proper), and wrote with his own hand the last two leaves of the third tome, which ends with three instead of four couplets: thus he completed Kamar al-Zamán (Night <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CCLXXXI</span>⁠–⁠<span epub:type="z3998:roman">CCCXXIX</span>) and the following tales:⁠—</p>

			<p>In Paris, Dom Chavis forgathered with M. Cazotte, a <span xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span> of the category “light,” an <i><span xml:lang="fr">ingénieux écrivain</span></i>, distinguished for “gaiety, delicacy, wit and Attic elegance,” and favorably known for (<i><span xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) his poem “Olivier,” his “Diable Amoureux,” “The Lord Impromptu,” and a travesty of The Nights called “The Thousand and One Fopperies.” The two agreed to collaborate, the Syrian translating the Arabic into French, and the Parisian metamorphosing the manner and matter to “the style and taste of the day”; that is to say, working up an exaggerated imitation, a caricature, of Galland. The work appeared, according to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> A. G. Ellis, of the British Museum, who kindly sent me these notes, in <i><span xml:lang="fr">Le Cabinet | des Fées, | ou | Collection choisie | des Contes des Fées, | et autres contes merveilleux, | ornés de figures. | Tome trente-huitième-(quarante-unième). | À Genève, | chez Bárde, Manget et Compagnie, | Imprimeurs-Libraires. | Et se trouve à Paris | Rue et Hôtel Serpente.</span></i> | 1788⁠–⁠89, 8<sup>o</sup><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7746" id="noteref-7746" epub:type="noteref">7746</a> |.

			<p>Of these thirty-four only five (<abbr>MS.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVII</span> and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span>) have not been found in the original Arabic.</p>
			<p>Public opinion was highly favourable to the “Suite” when first issued. Orientalism was at that time new to Europe, and the general was startled by its novelties, <i><span xml:lang="la"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr></span></i> by “Women wearing drawers and trousers like their husbands, and men arrayed in loose robes like their wives, yet at the same time cherishing, as so many goats, each a venerable length of beard.” (Heron’s Preface.) They found its “phænomena so remote from the customs and manners of Europe, that, when exhibited as entering into the ordinary system of human affairs, they could not fail to confer a considerable share of amusive novelty on the characters and events with which they were connected.” (Ditto, Preface.) Jonathan Scott roundly pronounced the continuation a forgery. <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Patrick Russell (History of Aleppo, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 385) had no good opinion of it, and Caussin de Perceval (père, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 40⁠–⁠46) declared the version <i><span xml:lang="fr">éloignée du goût Orientale</span></i>; yet he re-translated the tales from the original Arabic (<i><span xml:lang="fr">Continués</span></i>, Paris, 1806), and in this he was followed by Gauttier, while Southey borrowed the idea of his beautiful romance, Thalaba the Destroyer, now in Lethe from the “History of Maughraby.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> A. G. Ellis considers these tales as good as the old “Arabian Nights,” and my friend <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. F. Kirby, (Appendix to The Nights, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> <abbr>p.</abbr> 476), quite agrees with him that Chavis and Cazotte’s Continuation is well worthy of republication in its entirety. It remained for the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, in one of those ignorant and scurrilous articles with which it periodically outrages truth and good taste (<abbr>No.</abbr> 535, July, 1886), to state, “Cazotte published his <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Suite des Mille et une Nuits</span></cite>, a barefaced forgery, in 1785.” A barefaced forgery! when the original of twenty-eight tales out of thirty-four are perfectly well known, and when sundry of these appear in <abbr>MSS.</abbr> of “The Thousand Nights and a Night.”</p>
			<p>The following is a list of the Tales (widely differing from those of Chavis and Cazotte) which appeared in the version of Caussin de Perceval.</p>

			<p>I need hardly offer any observations upon these tales, as they have been discussed in the preceding pages.</p>
			<p>By an error of the late M. Reinaud (for which see <abbr>p.</abbr> 39 Histoire d’ ’Alâ al-Dîn by M. H. Zotenberg, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">MDCCCLXXXVIII</span>) the <abbr>MS.</abbr> <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Supplément Arabe, <abbr>No.</abbr> 1716</span></cite>, in the writing of Dom Chavis has been confounded with <abbr>No.</abbr> 1723, which is not written by the Syrian priest but which contains the originals of the Cazotte Continuation as noted by M. C. de Perceval (<cite><span xml:lang="fr">Les Mille et une Nuits</span></cite>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> Préf. <abbr>p.</abbr> 17, et seqq.).

The thick quarto measures centimètres 20½ long by 16 wide; the binding is apparently Italian and the paper is European, but the filegrane or water-mark, which is of three varieties, a coronet, a lozenge-shaped bunch of circles and a nondescript, may be Venetian or French. It contains 765 pages, paginated after European fashion, but the last eleven leaves are left blank reducing the number written to 742; and the terminal note, containing the date, is on the last leaf. Each page numbers 15 lines and each leaf has its catchword (<i><span xml:lang="fr">mot de rappel</span></i>). It is not ordered by “karrás” or quires; but is written upon 48 sets of 4 double leaves. The text is in a fair Syrian hand, but not so flowing as that of <abbr>No.</abbr> 1716, by Sháwísh himself, which the well-known Arabist, Baron de Slane, described as <i><span xml:lang="fr">Bonne écriture orientale de la fin du <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span><sup>e</sup> Siècle</span></i>.

			<p>Upon these tales I would be permitted to offer a few observations. No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> begins with a Christian formula:⁠—“In the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost” (Rúhu’l-Kudus); and it is not translated, because it is a mere replica of the Ten Wazirs (Suppl. <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 55⁠–⁠151). The second, containing “The Sage Haykár,” which is famous in folk-lore throughout the East, begins with the orthodox Moslem “Bismillah,” <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> “King Sapor” is prefaced by a Christian form which to the Trinitarian formula adds, “Allah being One”: this, again, is not translated, because it repeats the “Ebony Horse” (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 1). No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, which opens with the Bismillah, is found in the Sabbágh <abbr>MS.</abbr> of The Nights (see Suppl. <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>) as the <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Haroun al-Raschid et de la descendante de Chosroès</span></cite>. <cite>Albondoqani</cite> (Nights <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXX</span>⁠–⁠<span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXVII</span>). No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, which also has the Moslem invocation, is followed by the “Caliph and the Three Kalandars,” where, after the fashion of this our <abbr>MS.</abbr>, the episodes (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, 104⁠–⁠130), are taken bodily from “The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad” (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 82), and are converted into a separate History. No. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> has no title to be translated, being a replica of the long sea-tale in <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, 264.

			<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> edit. of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">MDCCCLXXVI</span>), which omits the name of Professor Galland, one of the marking Orientalists in his own day, has not ignored Jacques Cazotte, remarkable for chequered life and noble death. Born in 1720, at Dijon, where his father was Chancellor for the Province of Burgundy, he studied with the Jesuits at home; and, having passed through the finishing process in Paris, he was introduced to public life by the <i><span xml:lang="fr">Administration de la Marine</span></i>. He showed early taste for poetry as well as prose, and composed songs, tales, and an opera⁠—the “Thousand and one Fopperies.” His physique is described as a tall figure, with regular features, expressive blue eyes, and fine hair, which he wore long. At twenty-seven he became a commissary in the office and was presently sent as Comptroller to the Windward Islands, including the French Colony Martinique, which then as now was famous for successful woman-kind. At these head quarters he became intimate with Père Lavalette, Superior of the S. J. Mission, and he passed some years of a pleasant and not unintellectual career. Returning to Paris on leave of absence he fell in with a country-woman and an old family friend, Madame La Poissonnier, who had been appointed head nurse to the Duke of Burgundy; and, as the child in her charge required lulling to sleep, Cazotte composed the favourite <em>romances (ballads)</em>, <i><span xml:lang="fr">Tout au beau milieu des Ardennes</span></i>, and <i><span xml:lang="fr">Commère Il faut chauffer le lit</span></i>. These <i><span xml:lang="it">scherzi</span></i>, however, brought him more note than profit, and soon afterwards he returned to Martinique.</p>
			<p>During his second term of service Cazotte wrote his heroic-comic poem, the Roman d’Olivier, in twelve cantos, afterwards printed in Paris (2 <abbr>vols.</abbr> 8vo, 1765); and it was held a novel and singular composition. When the English first attacked (in 1759) Saint Pierre of Martinique, afterwards captured by Rodney in 1762, the sprightly <i><span xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i> showed abundant courage and conduct, but over-exertion injured his health, and he was again driven from his post by sickness. He learned, on landing in France, that his brother, whilome Vicar-General to M. de Choiseul, Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne, had died and left him a fair estate, Pierry, near Epernay; he therefore resigned his appointment and retired with the title “Commissary-General to the Marine.” But presently he lost 50,000 écus⁠—the whole fruit of his economies⁠—by the speculations of Père Lavalette to whose hands he had entrusted his estates, negroes, and effects at Martinique. These had been sold and the cheques had been forwarded to the owner: the S. J., however, refused to honour them. Hence the scandal of a law-suit in which Cazotte showed much delicacy and regard for the feelings of his former tutors.</p>
			<p>Meanwhile Cazotte had married Elizabeth Roignon, daughter to the Chief Justice of Martinique; he returned to the Parisian world with some éclat and he became an universal favourite on account of his happy wit and humour, his bonhomie, his perfect frankness, and his hearty amiability. The vogue of “Olivier” induced him to follow it up with <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Le Diable Amoureux</span></cite>, a continuation or rather parody of Voltaire’s <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Guerre civile de Genève</span></cite>: this work was so skilfully carried out that it completely deceived the world; and it was followed by sundry minor pieces which were greedily read. Unlike the esprits forts of his age, he became after a gay youthtide an ardent Christian; he made the Gospel his rule of life; and he sturdily defended his religious opinions; he had also the moral courage to enter the lists with M. de Voltaire, then the idol-in-chief of the classes and the masses.</p>
			<p>In later life Cazotte met Dom Chavis, who was translating into a curious jargon (Arabo-Franco-Italian) certain Oriental tales; and, although he was nearing the Psalmist’s age-term of man, he agreed to “collaborate.” The Frenchman used to take the pen at midnight when returning from “social pleasures,” and work till 4⁠–⁠5 <abbr>a.m.</abbr> As he had prodigious facility and spontaneity he finished his part of the task in two winters. Some of the tales in the suite, especially that of “Maugraby,” are attributed wholly to his invention; and, as a rule, his aim and object were to diffuse his spiritual ideas and to write treatises on moral perfection under the form of <i><span xml:lang="la">novelle</span></i>.</p>
			<p>Cazotte, after a well-spent and honourable life, had reason to expect with calmness “the evening and ending of a fine day.” But this was not to be, the Great Revolution had burst like a hurricane over the land, and he was doomed to die a hero’s death. His character was too candid, and his disposition too honest, for times which suggested concealment. He had become one of the Illuminati, and La Harpe ascribed to him the celebrated prophecy which described the minutest events of the Great Revolution. A Royalist <i><span xml:lang="fr">pur sang</span></i>, he freely expressed his sentiments to his old friend Ponteau, then Secretary of the Civil List. His letters came to light shortly after the terrible day, August 10, 1792: he was summarily arrested at Pierry and brought to Paris, where he was thrown into prison. On <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 3, when violence again waxed rampant, he was attacked by the patriot-assassins, and was saved only by the devotion of his daughter Elizabeth, who threw herself upon the old man crying, “You shall not reach my father’s heart before piercing mine.” The courage of the noble pair commanded the admiration of the ruffians, and they were carried home in triumph.</p>
			<p>For a few weeks the family remained unmolested, but in those days “Providence” slept and Fortune did not favour the brave. The Municipality presently decreed a second arrest, and the venerable <span xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span>, aged seventy-two, was sent before the revolutionary tribunal appointed to deal with the pretended offences of August 10. He was subjected to an interrogatory of thirty-six hours, during which his serenity and presence of mind never abandoned him and impressed even his accusers. But he was condemned to die for the all-sufficient reason:⁠—“It is not enough to be a good son, a good husband, a good father, one must also prove oneself a good citizen.” He spent his last hours with his confessor, wrote to his wife and children, praying his family not to beweep him, not to forget him, and never to offend against their God; and this missive, with a lock of his hair for his beloved daughter, he finally entrusted to the ghostly father. Upon the scaffold he turned to the crowd and cried, “I die as I have lived, truthful and faithful to my God and my King.” His venerable head, crowned with the white honours of age, fell on <abbr>Sept.</abbr> 25, 1792.</p>
			<p>Cazotte printed many works, some of great length, as the <cite><span xml:lang="fr">Œuvres Morales</span></cite>, which filled 7 vols, 8vo. in the complete edition of 1817; and the biographers give a long list of publications, besides those above-mentioned, romantic, ethical, and spiritual, in verse and in prose. But he wrote mainly for his own pleasure, he never sought fame, and consequently his reputation never equalled his merit. His name, however, still smells sweet, passing sweet, amid the corruption and the frantic fury of his day and the memory of the witty, genial, and virtuous <span xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span> still blossoms in the dust.</p>
			<p>During my visit to Paris in early 1887, M. Hermann Zotenberg was kind enough to show me the <abbr>MS.</abbr>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 1723, containing the original tales of the “New Arabian Nights.” As my health did not allow me sufficient length of stay to complete my translation, Professor Houdas (for whom, see Appendix, <abbr>p.</abbr> 10, Suppl. <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>) kindly consented to copy the excerpts required, and to explain the words and phrases which a deficiency of dictionaries and vocabularies at an outlandish port-town rendered unintelligible to me.</p>
			<p>In translating a <abbr>MS.</abbr>, which has never been collated or corrected and which abounds in errors of omission and commission, I have been guided by one consideration only, which is, that my first and chiefest duty to the reader is to make my book readable at the same time that it lays before him the whole matter which the text offered or ought to have offered. Hence I have not hesitated when necessary to change the order of the sentences, to delete tautological words and phrases, to suppress descriptions which are needlessly re-iterated, and in places to supply the connecting links without which the chain of narrative is weakened or broken. These are liberties which must be allowed, unless the translator’s object be to produce a mutilated version of a mutilation.</p>
			<p>Here also I must express my cordial gratitude to <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Alexander J. Cotheal, Consul-General for Nicaragua, in New York. This distinguished Arabist not only sent to me across the seas his <abbr>MS.</abbr> containing, <i><span xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, “The Tale of Attaf,” he also undertook to translate it for my collection upon my distinct assurance that its many novelties of treatment deserved an especial version. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. F. Kirby has again conferred upon my readers an important service by his storiological notes. Lastly, <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Steingass has lent me, as before, his valuable aid in concluding as he did in commencing this series, and on putting the colophon to</p>
