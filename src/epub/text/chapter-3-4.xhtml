<p>It is related by truthful men, O King, that a certain bird flew high
up firmament-wards and presently lit on a rock in the midst
of water which was running. And as he sat there, behold, the
current carried to him the carcass of a man, and lodged it against
the rock, for being swollen it floated. The bird, which was a
water-fowl, drew near and examining it, found that it was the
dead body of a son of Adam and saw in it sign of spear and stroke
of sword. So he said to himself, "I presume that this man who
hath been slain was some evil-doer, and that a company banded
themselves together against him and put him to death and were
at peace from him and his evil-doing." And as he continued
marvelling at this, suddenly the vultures and kites came down
upon the carcass from all sides and gat round it; which when the
water-fowl saw, he feared with sore affright and said, "I cannot
abide here any longer." So he flew away in quest of a place where
he might wone, till that carcass should come to an end and the
birds of prey leave it; and he stayed not in his flight, till he found
a river with a tree in its midst. So he alighted on the tree, troubled
and distraught and sore grieved for departing from his birth-place,
and said to himself, "Verily sorrows cease not to follow me: I was
at my ease when I saw that carcass, and rejoiced therein with
much joy, saying, "This is a gift of daily bread which Allah hath
dealt to me: but my joy became annoy and my gladness turned
to sadness, for the ravenous birds, which are like lions, seized
upon it and tare it to pieces and came between me and my prize.
So how can I hope to be secure from misfortune in this world; or
put any trust therein? Indeed, the proverb saith:—The world
is the dwelling of him who hath no dwelling: he who hath no
wits is cozened by it and entrusteth it with his wealth and his
child and his family and his folk; and whoso is cozened ceaseth
not to rely upon it, pacing proudly upon earth until he is laid
under earth and the dust is cast over his corpse by him who of all
men was dearest to him and nearest. But naught is better for
generous youth than patience under its cares and miseries. I have
left my native place and it is abhorrent to me to quit my brethren
and friends and loved ones." Now whilst he was thus musing
lo! a male-tortoise descended into the river and, approaching the
water-fowl, saluted him, saying, "O my lord, what hath exiled
thee and driven thee so far from thy place?" Replied the water-fowl,
"The descent of enemies thereon; for the wise brooketh not
the neighbourhood of his foe; and how well saith the poet:—</p>

      <div class="line">Whenas on any land the oppressor doth alight, ✿ There's nothing left for those, that dwell therein, but flight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1382" id="noteref-1382" epub:type="noteref">1382</a></div>

<p>Quoth the tortoise, "If the matter be as thou sayest and the case
as thou describest, I will not leave thee nor cease to stand before
thee, that I may do thy need and fulfil thy service; for it is said
that there is no sorer desolation than that of him who is an exile,
cut off from friends and home; and it is also said that no calamity
equalleth that of severance from the good; but the best solace for
men of understanding is to seek companionship in strangerhood
and be patient under sorrows and adversity. Wherefore I hope
that thou wilt approve of my company, for I will be to thee a
servant and a helper." Now when the water-fowl heard the
tortoise's words he answered, "Verily, thou art right in what thou
sayest for, by my life, I have found grief and pain in separation,
what while I have been parted from my place and sundered from
my brethren and friends; seeing that in severance is an admonition
to him who will be admonished and matter of thought for him who
will take thought. If the generous youth find not a companion to
console him, weal is for ever cut off from him and ill is eternally
established with him; and there is nothing for the sage but to
solace himself in every event with brethren and be constant in
patience and endurance: indeed these two are praiseworthy qualities,
and both uphold one under calamities and vicissitudes of the
world and ward off startling sorrows and harrowing cares, come
what will." Rejoined the tortoise, "Beware of sorrow, for it will
spoil thy life and waste thy manliness." And the two gave not
over conversing till the bird said, "Never shall I cease fearing the
shifts of time and vicissitudes of events." When the tortoise heard
this, he came up to him and, kissing him between the eyes, said to
him, "Never may the company of the birds cease to be blest in
thee and through thee, and find wisdom in thy good counsel! How
shalt thou be burdened with care and harm?" And he went on
to comfort the water-fowl and soothe his terrors till he became
re-assured. Then he flew to the place where the carcass was and
found on arriving there the birds of prey gone, and they had left
nothing of the body but bones; whereupon he returned to the
tortoise and acquainted him with the fact that the foe had disappeared
from his place, saying, "Know that of a truth I long for
return homewards to enjoy the society of my friends; for the sage
cannot endure separation from his native place." So they both
went thither and found naught to affright them; whereupon the
water-fowl began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And haply whenas strait descends on lot of generous youth ✿ Right sore, with Allah only lies his issue from annoy:</div>
      <div class="line">He's straitened, but full oft when rings and meshes straitest clip, ✿ He 'scapes his strait and joyance finds, albe I see no joy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So the twain abode in that island; and while the water-fowl was
enjoying a life of peace and gladness, suddenly Fate led thither a
hungry falcon, which drove its talons into the bird's belly and
killed him, nor did caution avail him when his term of life was
ended. Now the cause of his death was that he neglected to use
the formula of praise, and it is said that his form of adoration
was as follows, "Praised be our Lord in that He ordereth and
ordaineth; and praised be our Lord in that He enricheth and impoverisheth!"
Such was the water-fowl's end and the tale of the
ravenous birds. And when it was finished quoth the Sultan, "O
Shahrazad, verily thou overwhelmest me with admonitions and
salutary instances. Hast thou any stories of beasts?" "Yes,"
answered she; and began to tell the</p>
