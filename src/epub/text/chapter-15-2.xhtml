			<h2 epub:type="title">History of the Lovers of Syria<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7117" id="noteref-7117" epub:type="noteref">7117</a></h2>

<p>It is stated that of olden times and by-gone there dwelt in the
land of Syria two men which were brothers and whereof one was
wealthy and the other was needy. Now the rich man had a lovesome
daughter and a lovely, whilst the poor man had a son who
gave his heart to his cousin as soon as his age had reached his
tenth year. But at that time his father the pauper died and he
was left an orphan without aught of the goods of this world; the
damsel his cousin, however, loved him with exceeding love and
ever and anon would send him a somewhat of dirhams and this
continued till both of them attained their fourteenth years. Then
the youth was minded to marry the daughter of his uncle, so he
sent a party of friends to her home by way of urging his claim
that the father might wed her to him, but the man rejected them
and they returned disappointed. However, when it was the second
day a body of warm men and wealthy came to ask for the maid in
marriage, and they conditioned the needful conditions and stood
agreed upon the nuptials. Presently the tidings reached the
damsel who took patience till the noon o’ night, when she arose
and sought the son of her uncle, bringing with her a sum of two
thousand dinars which she had taken of her father’s good and she
knocked softly at the door. Hereupon the youth started from
sleep and went forth and found his cousin who was leading a she-mule
and an ass, so the twain bestrode either beast and travelled
through the remnant of the night until the morning morrowed.
Then they alighted to drink and to hide themselves in fear of being
seen until the second night fell when they mounted and rode for
two successive days, at the end of which they entered a town
seated on the shore of the sea. Here they found a ship equipped
for voyage, so they repaired to the Ra’is and hired for themselves
a sitting place; after which the cousin went forth to sell the ass
and the she-mule, and disappeared for a short time. Meanwhile
the ship had sailed with the daughter of his uncle and had left
the youth upon the strand and ceased not sailing day after day for
the space of ten days, and lastly made the port she purposed and
there cast anchor.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7118" id="noteref-7118" epub:type="noteref">7118</a> Thus it befel them; but as regards the youth,
when he had sold the beasts he returned to the ship and found
her not, and when he asked tidings thereof they told him that she
had put to sea; and hearing this he was mazed as to his mind and
sore amated as to his affair, nor wot he whither he should wend.
So he turned him inland sore dismayed. Now when the vessel
anchored in that port quoth the damsel to the captain, “O Ra’is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7119" id="noteref-7119" epub:type="noteref">7119</a>
hie thee ashore and bring for us a portion of flesh and fresh bread,”
and quoth he, “Hearkening and obedience,” whereupon he betook
himself to the town. But as soon as he was far from the vessel
she arose and donning male’s dress said to the sailors, “Do ye
weigh anchor and set sail,” and she shouted at them with the
shouting of seamen. Accordingly they did as she bade them and
the wind being fair and the weather favourable, ere an hour had
sped they passed beyond sight of land.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7120" id="noteref-7120" epub:type="noteref">7120</a> Presently the captain
returned bringing bread and meat but he found ne’er a ship, so
he asked tidings of her and they answered, “Verily she is gone.”
Hereupon he was perplext and he fell to striking hand upon hand
and crying out, “O my good and the good of folk!” and he
repented whenas repentance availed him naught. Accordingly, he
returned to the town unknowing whither he should wend and he
walked about like one blind and deaf for the loss of his craft. But as
regards the vessel, she ceased not sailing with those within till she
cast anchor near a city wherein was a King; and no sooner was
she made fast than the damsel arose and donning her most
sumptuous dress and decorations fell to scattering money amongst
the crew and saying to them, “Hearten your hearts and be not
afraid on any wise!” In due time the news of a fresh arrival
reached the Ruler, and he ordered his men to bring him tidings
concerning that vessel, and when they went for her and boarded
her they found that her captain was a damsel of virginal semblance
exceeding in beauty and loveliness. So they returned and reported
this to the King who despatched messengers bidding her lodge
with him for they had heightened their praises of her and the
excess of her comeliness, and he said in his mind, “By Allah, an
she prove as they describe her, needs must I marry her.” But the
damsel sent back saying, “I am a clean maid, nor may I land
alone but do thou send to me forty girls, virgins like myself when
I will disembark together with them.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Five Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede, which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the damsel
demanded of the King forty clean maids and said, “We will land,
I and they together,” whereto he replied, “The right is with her.”
Hereupon he ordered all those about him, the Lords of his land
and the Commons, that each and every who had in the house a
virginal daughter, should bring her to him until the full tale of
forty (the daughter of the Wazir being amongst them) was told
and he sent them on board the ship where the damsel was about
sitting down to supper. But as soon as the maidens came she met
them in her finest attire, none of the number being more beauteous
than herself, and she salam’d to them and invited them into the
cuddy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7121" id="noteref-7121" epub:type="noteref">7121</a> where she bade food be served to them and they ate and
were cheered and solaced, after which they sat down to converse
till it was the middle of the night. Now when sleep prevailed
over the girls they retired to their several berths, and when they
were drowned in slumber, the damsel arose softly and arousing
the crew bade them leave their moorings and shake out their
canvas; nor did daylight dawn to them ere they had covered a far
distance. As soon as the maidens awoke they saw themselves on
board a ship amid the billows of the main, and as they asked the
Captainess she answered, “Fear not for yourselves or for the
voyage you are making;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7122" id="noteref-7122" epub:type="noteref">7122</a> and she gentled them and solaced them
until whatso was in their hearts was allayed. However, touching
the affair of the King, when morrowed the morn he sent to the ship
with an order for the damsel to land with the forty virgins, but
they found not the craft and they returned and reported the same
to their lord, who cried, “By Allah, this be the discreetest of deeds
which none other save she could have done.” So he arose without
stay or delay and taking with him the Wazir (both being in disguise),
he went down to the shore and looked around but he could
not find what had become of them. And as regards the vessel carrying
the virgins she ceased not sailing until she made port beside a
ruined city wherein was none inhabitant, and here the crew cast
anchor and furled their sails when behold, a gang of forty pirate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7123" id="noteref-7123" epub:type="noteref">7123</a>
men, ever ready to cut the highway and their friends to betray,
boarded them, crying in high glee, “Let us slay all in her and
carry off whatso we find.” When they appeared before the damsel
they would have effected their intent; but she welcomed them and
said, “Do ye return ashore: we be forty maids and ye forty men
and to each of you shall befal one and I will belong to your
Shaykh, for that I am the Captainess.” Now when they heard
this they rejoiced with excessive joy and they said, “Walláhi, our
night shall be a blessed one by virtue of your coming to us;”
whereto she asked, “Have you with you aught of sheep?” They
answered, “We have,” and quoth she, “Do ye slay of them
somewhat for supper and fetch the meat that we may cook it for
you.” So a troop of pirates went off and brought back ten lambs
which they slaughtered and flayed and brittled. Then the damsel
and those with her tucked up their sleeves and hung up their
chauldrons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7124" id="noteref-7124" epub:type="noteref">7124</a> and cooked the meat after delicatest fashion, and when
it was thoroughly done and prepared, they spread the trays and
the pirates came forward one and all, and ate and washed their
hands and they were in high spirits each and every saying, “This
night I will take to me a girl.” Lastly she brought to them coffee
which they drank, but hardly had it settled in their maws when
the Forty Thieves fell to the ground, for she had mixed up with
it flying Bhang<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7125" id="noteref-7125" epub:type="noteref">7125</a> and those who had drunk thereof became like
unto dead men. Hereupon the damsel arose without loss of time
and taking in her hand a sharp-grided sword fell to cutting off
their heads and casting them into the sea until she came to the
Shaykh of the Pirates and in his case she was satisfied with
shaving his beard and tearing out his eye-teeth and bidding the
crew cast him ashore. They did as she commanded, after which
she conveyed the property of all the caitiffs and having distributed
the booty amongst the sailors, bade them weigh anchor and shake
out their canvas. On this wise they left that ruined city until they
had made the middle of the main and they fared for a number of
days athwart the billowy deep nor could they hit upon their course
amongst the courses of the sea until Destiny cast them beside a
city. They made fast to the anchorage-ground, and the damsel
arose and donning Mameluke’s dress and arraying the Forty
Virgins in the same attire all walked together and paced about the
shore and they were like garden blooms. When they entered the
streets they found all the folk a-sorrowing, so they asked one of
them and he answered, “The Sultan who over-reigneth this city is
dead and the reign lacketh rule.” Now in that stead and under
the hand of the Wazir, was a Bird which they let loose at certain
times, and whenever he skimmed round and perched upon the head
of any man to him they would give the Sultanate.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7126" id="noteref-7126" epub:type="noteref">7126</a> By the decree
of the Decreer they cast the fowl high in air at the very hour
when the damsel was landing and he hovered above her and
settled upon her head (she being in slave’s attire), and the city
folk and the lords of the land cried out, “Strange! passing
strange!” So they flushed the bird from the place where he had
alighted and on the next day they freed him again at a time when
the damsel had left the ship, and once more he came and settled
upon her head. They drove him away, crying, “Oh rare! oh
rare!” but as often as they started him from off her head he
returned to it and alighted there again. “Marvellous!” cried the
Wazir, “but Allah Almighty hath done this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7127" id="noteref-7127" epub:type="noteref">7127</a> and none shall object
to what He doeth nor shall any reject what He decreeth.” Accordingly,
they gave her the Sultanate together with the signet-ring of
governance and the turband of commandment and they seated her
upon the throne of the reign. Hereupon she fell to ordering the
Forty Virgins who were still habited as Mamelukes and they served
the Sultan for a while of time, till one day of the days when the
Wazir came to the presence and said, “O King of the Age, I have
a daughter, a model of beauty and loveliness and I am desirous
of wedding her with the Sovran because one such as thou should
not remain in single blessedness.”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent, and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
Wazir to the Sultan, “I have a daughter, a model of beauty and
loveliness, and I am desirous of wedding her with the Sultan,
because one such as thou should not remain in single blessedness.”
“Do whatso thou wishest,” quoth the King, “and Allah prosper
thy doing.” Hereupon the Wazir fell to preparing the marriage-portion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7128" id="noteref-7128" epub:type="noteref">7128</a>
of his daughter, and of forwarding her affair with the
Sultan, until her wedding appointments<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7129" id="noteref-7129" epub:type="noteref">7129</a> and other matters were
completed. After this he caused the marriage-tie be tied, and
he brought her to the supposed Sultan where she lay for the first
night, but the damsel having performed the Wuzú ablution did
naught but pray through the hours of darkness. When dawned
the day the Wazir’s wife which was the mother of the maiden
came to look upon her daughter and asked her of her case, and
the bride answered, “All the livelong night hath he passed in
orisons, nor came he near me even once.” Quoth the mother,
“O my daughter, this be the first night, and assuredly he was
ashamed, for he is young in years, and he knoweth not what to
do; haply also his heart hangeth not upon thee; and he is but a
raw lad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7130" id="noteref-7130" epub:type="noteref">7130</a> However, on the coming night ye shall both enjoy your
desire.” But as soon as it was the evening of the next day the
Sultan went in to his Harim and made the minor ablution, and
abode in prayer through the night until the morrow morrowed,
when again the mother came to see how matters stood, and
she asked her daughter, who answered, “All the dark hours
he hath passed in devotion, and he never approached me.” Now
on the third night it happened after like fashion, so the mother
said, “O my daughter, whenever thou shalt see thy husband sitting
by thy side, do thou throw thyself upon his bosom.” The bride
did as she was bidden, and casting herself upon his breast cried,
“O King of the Age, haply I please thee not at all;” whereat said
the other, “O light of mine eyes, thou art a joy to me for ever;
but I am about to confide to thee somewhat and say me canst thou
keep a secret?” Quoth she, “Who is there like me for hiding
things in my heart?” and quoth the other, “I am a clean maid,
and my like is thy like, but the reason for my being in man’s habit
is that the son of my uncle, who is my betrothed, hath been lost
from me and I have been lost from him, but when Allah shall
decree the reunion of our lots he shall marry thee first and he shall
not pay the bridegroom’s visit save unto thee, and after that to
myself.” The Wazir’s daughter accepted the excuse, and then
arising went forth and brought a pigeon whose weazand she split
and whose blood she daubed upon the snow-white sheet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7131" id="noteref-7131" epub:type="noteref">7131</a> And
when it was morning and her mother again visited her, the bride
showed her this proof of her pucelage, and she rejoiced thereat and
her father rejoiced also. After this the Sultan ruled for a while of
time, but she was ever in deep thought concerning what device
could be devised in order to obtain tidings of her father and her
cousin and what had wrought with them the changes of times and
tides. So she bade edify a magnificent Hammám and by its side
a coffee house,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7132" id="noteref-7132" epub:type="noteref">7132</a> both nearhand to the palace, and forthwith she
summoned architects and masons and plasterers and painters, and
when all came between her hands she said to them, “Do ye take
a long look at my semblance and mark well my features for I desire
that you make me a carven image<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7133" id="noteref-7133" epub:type="noteref">7133</a> which shall resemble me in all
points, and that you fashion it according to my form and figure,
and you adorn it aright and render it to represent my very self in
all proportions, and then bring it to me.” They obeyed her order
and brought her a statue which was herself to a nail, so she looked
upon it and was pleased therewith. Then she ordered them set the
image over the Hammam-door, so they placed it there, and after
she issued a firman and caused it to be cried through the city that
whoso should enter that Bath to bathe and drink coffee, should do
so free and gratis and for naught. When this was done the tongues
of the folk were loosed with benison, and they fell to praying for
the Sultan and the endurance of his glory, and the permanence of
his governance till such time as the bruit was spread abroad by the
caravans and travellers, and the folk of all regions had heard of the
Hammam and the coffee-house. Meanwhile the Sultan had summoned
two eunuchs and ordered them and repeatedly enjoined them
that whoso might approach the statue and consider it straitly him
should they seize and bring before the presence. Accordingly, the
slaves fared forth and took their seats before the doors of the
baths. After a while of time the father of the damsel who
had become Sultan wandered forth to seek her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7134" id="noteref-7134" epub:type="noteref">7134</a> and arrived at
that city, where he heard that whoso entered the Hammam
to bathe and afterwards drank coffee did this without cost;
so he said in his mind, “Let me go thither and enjoy myself.”
Then he repaired to the building and designed to enter, when
behold, he looked at the statue over the gateway, and he stood
still and considered it with the tears flowing adown his cheeks, and
he cried, “Indeed this figure be like her!” But when the eunuchs
saw him they seized him and carried him away until they had led
him to the Sultan his daughter, who, seeing him, recognised him
forthright, and bade set apart for him an apartment and appointed
to him rations for the time being. The next that appeared was
the son of her uncle, who also had wandered as far as that city
seeking his cousin, and he also having heard the folk speaking
anent a free entrance to the Baths, said in himself, “Do thou get
thee like others to that Hammam and solace thyself.” But when
he arrived there he also cast a look at that image and stood before
it and wept for an hour or so as he devoured it with his eyes, when
the eunuchry beholding him seized and carried him off to the Sultan,
who knew him at first sight. So she bade prepare a place for him
and appointed to him rations for the time being. Then also came
the Ra’is of the ship, who had reached that city seeking his lost
vessel, and when the fame of the free Hammam came to his ears,
he said in his mind, “Go thou to the Baths and solace thyself.”
And when he arrived there and looked upon the statue and fixed
his glance upon it he cried out, “Walláhi! ’tis her very self.”
Hereupon the eunuchry seized him and carried him to the Sultan
who seeing him recognized him and placed him in a place apart
for a while of time. Anon the King and the Wazir, who were
responsible for the Forty Virgins came to that city.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent, and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night?” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that the King accompanied
by the Wazir came to that city seeking the lost Forty
Virgins and when the twain had settled there and were stablisht
at ease their souls longed for the Baths and they said each to
other, “Hie we to the Hammam that we may wash away the dirt
which be the result of travel.” So they repaired to the place and
as they entered the gateway they looked up and fixed their eyes
upon the statue; and, as they continued to gaze thereupon, the
eunuchs who sighted them seized them and carried them off to
the Sultan.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7135" id="noteref-7135" epub:type="noteref">7135</a> When they stood between her hands and they
beheld the Forty Mamelukes who were also before her, the Wazir’s
glance happened to fall upon his daughter who was on similar wise
in slave’s habit, and he looked at her with the tears flowing adown
his cheeks and he said in his mind, “Walláhi! Verily this Mameluke
is like my child as like can be.” Hereupon the Sultan considered
the twain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7136" id="noteref-7136" epub:type="noteref">7136</a> and asked them of their case<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7137" id="noteref-7137" epub:type="noteref">7137</a> and they answered,
“We be Such-and-such and we are wandering about to seek our
daughter and her nine-and-thirty maidens.” Hereupon she
assigned to them also lodgings and rations for the present. Lastly
appeared the Pirate which had been Shaykh and comrade of the
Forty Thieves also seeking that city, and albeit he was aweary and
perplext yet he ceased not to wander that he might come upon
the damsel who had slain his associates and who had shaved his
beard and had torn out his eye teeth. He also when he heard of
the Hammam without charge and the free coffee-house said in
himself, “Hie thee to that place!” and as he was entering the
gateway he beheld the image and stood still and fell to speaking
fulsome speech and crying aloud and saying, “By Allah, this
statue is likest to her in stature and size and, by the Almighty, if
I can only lay my hand upon her and seize her I will slaughter
her even as one cutteth a mutton’s throat. Ah! Ah! an I could
but catch hold of her.” As he spake these words the eunuchry
heard him; so they seized him and dragged him along and
carried him before the Sultan who no sooner saw him and knew
him than she ordered him to jail. And they imprisoned him for
he had not come to that city save for the shortening of his days
and the lavishing of his life-blood and he knew not what was
predestined to him and in very sooth he deserved all that befel
him. Hereupon the damsel bade bring before her, her father and
her cousin and the Ra’is and the King and the Wazir and the
Pirate (while she still bore herself as one who administered the
Sultanate), and when it became night time all began to converse
one with other and presently quoth she to them, “O folk, let each
and every who hath a tale solace us with telling it.” Hereat
quoth one and all of them, “We wist not a recital nor can we
recount one;” and she rejoined, “I will relate unto you an
adventure.” They cried, “O King of the Age, pardon us! for
how shalt thou rehearse us an history and we sit listening
thereto?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7138" id="noteref-7138" epub:type="noteref">7138</a> and she replied, “Forasmuch as you have no say to
say, I will speak in your stead that we may shorten this our night.”
Then she continued, “There was a merchant man and a wealthy
with a brother which was needy, and the richard had a daughter
while the pauper had a son. But when the poor man died he left
only the boy who sought to marry the girl his cousin: his paternal
uncle, however, refused him maugre that she loved him and she
was beloved of him. Presently there came a party of substantial
merchants who demanded her in wedlock and obtained her and
agreed upon the conditions; when her sire was minded to marry
her to their man. This was hard upon the damsel and sore
grievous to her so she said:—By Allah, I will mate with none
save with my uncle’s son. Then she came to him at midnight
leading a she-mule and an ass and bringing somewhat of her
father’s moneys and she knocked at the youth’s door and he came
out to her and both went forth, he and she, in the outer darkness
of that murky night and the Veiler veiled her way.” Now when
the father and the cousin heard this adventure they threw themselves
on her neck,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7139" id="noteref-7139" epub:type="noteref">7139</a> and rejoiced in her until the turn came for
her recounting the tale of the merchant-captain and he also
approved her and was solaced by her words. Then, as she related
the history concerning the King and the Wazir, they said, “By
Allah, this indeed is a sweet story and full of light and leading
and our lord the Sultan deserveth for this recital whatso he may
require.” But when she came to the Pirate he cried, “Walláhi,
O our lord the Sultan, this adventure is a grievous, and Allah
upon thee, tell us some other tale;” whereat all the hearers
rejoined, “By Allah, in very sooth the recital is a pleasing.” She
continued to acquaint them with the adventure of the Bird which
invested her with the monarchy and she ended with relating the
matter of the Hammam, at all whereof the audience wondered
and said, “By Allah, this is a delectable matter and a dainty;”
but the Pirate cried aloud, “Such story pleaseth me not in any
way for ’tis heavy upon my heart!”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that the Pirate cried
out, “This tale is heavy upon my heart!” Presently the damsel
resumed her speech and said:—Walláhi! if my mother and my
father say sooth this be my sire and that be my cousin and here
standeth the King and there the Wazir and yonder are the Ra’is
and the Pirate, the comrade of the Forty Thieves whose only will
and wish was to dishonour us maidens all. Then she resumed,
addressing the King and his Minister, “These forty Mamelukes
whom you see standing between your hands are the virgin girls
belonging to you.” After which she presented the twain with
sumptuous gifts and they took their maidens and with them went
their ways. Next she restored to the Ra’is his ship and freighted
it with her good and he set forth in it on his return voyage. But
as regards the Pirate she commanded her attendants to kindle for
him a furious fire and they lit it till it roared and the sparks flew
high in air, after which they pinioned him and cast him into the
flames, where his flesh was melted before his bones.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7140" id="noteref-7140" epub:type="noteref">7140</a> But as concerned
her cousin she caused the marriage tie to be tied between
him and the Wazir’s daughter and he paid her his first visit on
that same night and then she ordered her father to knit the
wedding knot with the youth on the next night and when this was
done forthwith he went in unto her. After this she committed to
him the Sultanate and he became a Sovran and Sultan in her
stead, and she bade fetch her mother to that city where her cousin
governed and where her father-in-law the Wazir was chief
Councillor of the realm. On this wise it endured for the length of
their lives, and fair to them were the term and the tide and the
age and the time, and they led of lives the joyfullest and a livelihood
of the perfectest until they were consumed by the world
and died out generation of the generation.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7141" id="noteref-7141" epub:type="noteref">7141</a></p>
