			<h2 epub:type="title">Tale of Mohsin and Musa<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7534" id="noteref-7534" epub:type="noteref">7534</a></h2>

<p>It fortuned once upon a time that two men went forth from the
same place, one foregoing the other, and they forgathered by the
way. Now each had a bag full of flour and a flask<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7535" id="noteref-7535" epub:type="noteref">7535</a> containing somewhat
of water; and when they made acquaintance on the road the
first of them said to his companion, “O my brother, what may be thy
name?” and said the Second, “I am hight Mohsin, the Beneficent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7536" id="noteref-7536" epub:type="noteref">7536</a>
and thou what art thou called?” Quoth the other, “Músà the
Malignant.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7537" id="noteref-7537" epub:type="noteref">7537</a> So the two fared on in converse and whenever mealtime
came round, each would bring out a portion of meal and knead
it and make of it a scone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7538" id="noteref-7538" epub:type="noteref">7538</a> and light a fire and bake it thereon:
after which they would satisfy their hunger. But Mohsin knew not
that had been doomed for him by his companion Musa the Misdoer,
so the twain would fare together and feed together. On
the following day quoth Musa to Mohsin, “O my brother, I have
with me a bag of flour and a flask of water and thou hast the same,
and whenever eating-time cometh round each one bringeth out
somewhat of his vivers. Now this is not right; ’twere the better
way that we first eat that is with thee and when ’tis ended we use
my provaunt.” “’Tis well, O my brother,” quoth Mohsin. They
agreed upon this condition and whenever moved by appetite they
ate of Mohsin’s viaticum until his bag of flour and his flask of
water were clean emptied. But when the meal-hour came, Musa
arose and made for him a single scone and no more, and baked
it and ate it by himself, while Mohsin sat-by looking on. This
befel time after time for the first day and the second day until
Mohsin waxed anhungered and famine wrung his vitals, so quoth
he to Musa, “O my brother, give me somewhat of thy food that
I may nourish myself therewith, for indeed I am empty exceedingly.”
But Musa made reply, “By Allah, I will not give it to
thee; no, not a single mouthful.” Rejoined Mohsin, “O my
brother, we two made covenant that we should become brethren,
and first eat of my provaunt and then of thine; now, however,
thou art not pleased to grant me or bite or sup. This is not
the act of an honest man.” He answered, “Be brief! an thou be
hungry I will give thee half of my scone on condition that I
pluck out thine eye.” “How so, O my brother?” rejoined
Mohsin, “Wilt thou blind me of one eye for the sake of half
a scone? better leave me to die with my sight as it is.” Said
Musa, “At thy pleasure!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7539" id="noteref-7539" epub:type="noteref">7539</a> But on the third day Mohsin was
like to sink for extreme hunger, and he cried, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great. Do thou, O Musa, give the half-scone and pluck out one
of mine eyes.” Musa did as he was bidden, and thrusting forth
his finger gouged<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7540" id="noteref-7540" epub:type="noteref">7540</a> out the right eye, whereby Mohsin remained
purblind, withal was he not filled by the half-scone. Now on the
fourth day Mohsin waxed yet more ravenous and famine was
right sore upon him, and he cried, “There is no Majesty! by
Allah, O Musa, my brother, I am a-famished, so pity me and the
Lord shall pity thee.” Replied the other, “I will give thee
nothing until I shall have gouged out thine other eye.” Quoth
Mohsin, “Verily we are Allah’s and unto him we shall return!
but, by the Almighty, famishing is bitter; so do thou with me,
O Musa, what the Omniscient hath predestined as to the plucking
out of my two eyes.” Accordingly the man gave him the half
scone and plucked out his other eye; and on such wise made
him stone blind. Hereupon Musa left his companion darkly
tramping<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7541" id="noteref-7541" epub:type="noteref">7541</a> about the roads. Now in the neighbourhood of that
place was a well full of water;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7542" id="noteref-7542" epub:type="noteref">7542</a> so when Mohsin drew near
knowing nothing thereof, Musa came up and pushed him thereinto;
and while falling into the pit Mohsin said to himself, “O
Lord, thou hast doomed me to blinding and at last Thou hast
condemned me to drowning.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Musa
had thrust Mohsin into the well with intent to drown him, the
blinded man cried, “O Lord thou hast doomed me to blinding, and
at last Thou hast condemned me to drowning.” Then he struck
out with hands and feet till he felt the walls of the well wherein
he found two niches; so he set toes into one of them and there
stood awaiting the salvation of Allah which was nearhand; and
his heart was satisfied and he drank of the water. When the first
night fell behold, two of the Jinns came to the pit and sat down in
converse each with other, when quoth the first to the second,
“Walláhi! O certain person, there is now to be found nor sage
nor leach, and all of them are preposterous pretenders and balkers
of man’s intent.” Quoth the other, “What may be these words?”
and the former resumed, “By Allah, I have possessed the daughter
of the Sultan and she is the dearling of my heart whom I love
with dearest love; yet can none avail to unsorcel her of me.”
Quoth his companion, “And what would expel thee?” And quoth
he, “Naught will oust me save a black cock or a sable chicken;
and whenas one shall bring such and cut his throat under her feet
of a Saturday,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7543" id="noteref-7543" epub:type="noteref">7543</a> I shall not have power to approach the city wherein
she dwelleth.” “By Allah, O my brother,” said the other, “thou
hast spoken sooth: there is in this land nor wizard nor mediciner
who knoweth aught, and all of them are liars and contradictors
who lay claim to science without aught of intelligence; indeed
there is not one of them who knoweth of this tree (which adjoineth
our well) that whoso shall take the leaves thereof and plaster them
upon his eyes, even though he be born blind he will be gifted with
sight and wax sound after two or three days by the kind permission
of Allah Almighty. Yet are the folk all heedless of such virtue in
the tree.” Now Mohsin remained listening to these words and
pondering them as he stood supported by the side-wall of the well,
and when it was the last third of the night, the Jinns which were
conversing at the mouth took leave each of other. And as soon as
the day brake and the time waxed bright behold there came a Kafilah
which passed by the pit seeking drink for themselves and water for
their cattle. Presently they let down a bucket by a cord and when
Mohsin felt the rope he caught hold thereof, whereat the caravan
people cried, “We take refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned,”
and said one to other, “Verily in this well is a Satan!” Mohsin
heard their words and answered them and said, “Yá’llah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7544" id="noteref-7544" epub:type="noteref">7544</a> Ho
you, draw me out hence, for verily I am of mankind and not of
Jinn-kind and being blind I fell yesterday into this hole.” Cried
they, “Catch tight hold of the cord,” and when he did so they
drew him out and finding him weak from famine they gave him
a somewhat of food and he ate and drank. The caravan-folk on
like guise drank from the well and watered their beasts; after
which they would have led Mohsin away with them but he said,
“O my brethren (whose weal Allah increase<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7545" id="noteref-7545" epub:type="noteref">7545</a> and whose grace
may He reward!), I have a single want wherewith I fain ye would
favour me!” Asked they, “And what may that be?” and he
answered, “That ye direct me to the tree which adjoineth this well
and lead me close thereto and God shall gar your good to grow!”
Hereupon one hent him by the hand and after doing as he desired
and setting him beside the tree returned to his own folk and the
caravan loaded and left the place. Presently Mohsin swarmed up
the trunk; and, taking seat upon a branch of its branches, fell to
cropping the leaves and patching them upon either eye as he had
heard the Jinni prescribe; and hardly had two days gone by when
he felt healed of his hurt and opened his eyelids and saw what
was around him. Then, after taking somewhat of its foliage, he
came down from the tree and went on his wayfare until he entered
a city and found him a lodging. When this was done he fell to
threading the streets and ways crying aloud the while, “I am
the Leach, the Healer!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7546" id="noteref-7546" epub:type="noteref">7546</a> I am the Mediciner who can cure the
blind!” whereat all the one-eyed and the sightless would summon
him with outcries and he would apply to them somewhat of his
leaves; and after two or three days (he superintending the while)
they would open their eyes and see. On this wise went by a term
of time until at last the King of that city heard rumour of a new
leach; so he sent to him and summoned him and said to him,
“Art thou a clever Medicine-man even as they have informed me
concerning thee? I have a daughter ridden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7547" id="noteref-7547" epub:type="noteref">7547</a> by a Jinni of the
Jánn and we desire of thee that thou unsorcel her.” “And if I
avail not to free her?” asked Mohsin, and the King answered,
“Then will I kill thee even as I have slain a many before thee
who have looked upon the face of the Princess.” “And if I prove
able to deliver her and fend her from further offence?” “I will
give thee what thou askest of coin and hoards.” “No, O King of
the Age; this condition I will not accept: if I free her I must
take her to wife, for an I fail therein thou wilt slay me; and
unless thou agree with me after I shall have saved her that thou
e’en wed her to me.”——<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7548" id="noteref-7548" epub:type="noteref">7548</a> “’Tis well, O Shaykh; and for releasing
her I give thee a delay of three months for visiting and
healing her.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
covenanted with the Mediciner that the unsorcelling of the Princess
should be within three months; after which he set apart an apartment
for him with all the furniture and appurtenances thereof and
appointed to him rations of meat and drink. So Mohsin abode
with him the appointed time and he in the extreme of comfort
and enjoyment; but when the three months were ended the Sultan
sent for him and summoned him between his hands and said, “O
Shaykh, the term is gone-by.” Hereupon Shaykh Mohsin went
forth and bought him a black cock and when Sabbath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7549" id="noteref-7549" epub:type="noteref">7549</a> came round
the Sultan presented him to his daughter whom he found in sore
and sorrowful state, unknowing aught concerning herself or how
the mishap had occurred to her. Now when he went in and
looked upon her in such case, he drew near to her and fell to
reciting Koranic versets which avert evil (the Sultan sitting beside
them the while); and at the last he slaughtered the cock between
her feet. Hereat the Princess recovered her senses and rose up
and sat down<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7550" id="noteref-7550" epub:type="noteref">7550</a> forthright and called for meat and drink which were
brought to her; then she ate and drank and besought for herself
the guidance of God and said, “Alhamdolillah”—laud to the
Lord—and presently she kissed the hand of her sire and of
Shaykh Mohsin. Quoth the King, “O my daughter, art thou
indeed well?” and quoth she, “At this present I feel naught of
pain in my person nor do I sense anything of what hath been
with me; and all this is by blessing of yonder Shaykh thou hast
brought to me. But say me, O my father, what hast thou made
over to him of money as a reward for unsorcelling me?” “O my
daughter,” replied he, “I have offered him all he shall ask.” But
when the Princess recovered from her malady and returned to self,
she changed from mode to mode and she became as one cast in
the mould of beauty and loveliness and Shaykh Mohsin looking
upon her was dazed and amazed in his wits by cause of her
exceeding comeliness and seemlihead. Presently the Princess
addressed him, “O Shaykh Mohsin, what thing dost thou ask of
the King’s Majesty?” for indeed her heart was fulfilled of the love
to him which had mastered her. Now the Wazir had a son and it
was his aim that his heir should marry the King’s daughter, but
this his wish was in vain; for when she was certified that her salvation
was at the hand of Shaykh Mohsin, she said to her sire, “Do
thou, O my father, largesse what is dearest to thee upon my
healer.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7551" id="noteref-7551" epub:type="noteref">7551</a> Her design in these words was that the Sultan might
bestow her to wife upon her deliverer, and she added, “Indeed our
joyance hath been at his hands and he is deserving of munificence
full and abundant.” But again the object of her speech was that
her parent might espouse her to the Shaykh for the love to Mohsin
which had mastered her heart. Quoth her father, “O my daughter
we will give him a sumptuous robe of honour and ten purses;”
but quoth she, “No, O my sire, this be not gift sufficient for the
like of such service.” Now she was the sole prop of her parents
who had no child save herself, so the King replied, “O my
daughter, I will give him whatso thou shalt say.” Thereupon she
asked him, “How many of the folk came in to me and uncovered
my shame<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7552" id="noteref-7552" epub:type="noteref">7552</a> and were slain therefor?” and he answered, “Some
fifty.” Then cried she, “Had not Shaykh Mohsin been able to
exorcise me what hadst thou done with him?” “Indeed I had
slain him.” “Then Alhamdolillah—Glory be to God—for that my
deliverance was at his hand: so do thou bestow upon him thy
best,” and so she spake for that she was ashamed to say her sire,
“Wed me to him.” The King not understanding the hint she
had hinted said to her, “All thou wishest I will largesse to him;”
and she, “I have spoken to thee but thou hast not comprehended
my words! All who have looked upon my shame and proved
unable to deliver me thou wast wont to slay and this man hath
been my salvation after seeing me unveiled: how then wilt thou
gift him with money and means or condition with him when thou
art unable to carry out thy compact?” Hereupon the King
became ware of what was in his daughter’s mind and forthwith
sending to summon the Kazi and witnesses he bade bind the
marriage-bond between her and Shaykh Mohsin and in due time
let them lead him to her in procession and suffer him go in unto
her. So he cohabited with the Princess a while of time, after
which the life-term of the Sultan drew near, and he fell sick of a
sickness whereof he died. And when they had committed his
remains to earth the Lords of the land and the Grandees of command
forgathered and agreed in council that none should overrule
them save the Shaykh Mohsin. So they invested him with the
signet-ring of Sovranty and seated him upon the throne of
Kingship and he became Sovereign and Sultan. Moreover Allah
Almighty enlightened his heart in governance with justice and
equity; and all the subjects with the Notables of the realm and
the Rulers of high rank blessed him and prayed for him. Now
one day of the days Sultan Mohsin felt desirous of solacing
himself in the gardens; so he rode forth, he and his suite, when
he suddenly sighted his whilome comrade, the same who had
plucked out one eye for half a scone and had gouged out the other
eye for the other half. He bade them bring the man to the
presence and when they set him between his hands he asked him
saying, “O Shaykh, what may be thy name?” and he answered,
“I am hight Shaykh Mohammed.” So he carried him with his
suite to the gardens where they abode until day ended, after which
the Sultan rode back and entering his palace, bade bring Shaykh
Mohammed whom he despatched to the House of Hospitality.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7553" id="noteref-7553" epub:type="noteref">7553</a>
On the third day he bade summon his guest after supper-tide
and taking him by the hand led him into a cabinet and said, “O
Shaykh Mohammed, do thou tell us a tale.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
King entered the closet leading Mohammed by the hand he said
to him, “Do thou, O Shaykh, tell us a tale.” “By Allah, O our
lord,” quoth the other, “I know naught of stories.” Whereupon
the Sultan rejoined, “If so it be, I will relate to thee, O Shaykh
Mohammed, an adventure of my own and ’tis as follows:—Once
upon a time a man went forth his town and he made companionship
with another upon the way, and each one of them bore with
him a bag of meal and a flask of water.” On this wise the Sultan
continued recounting to him the real history of Mohsin and Musa
the Malignant, till at the end of the tale he said, “And Musa, after
gouging out both eyes of Mohsin for the sake of a single scone
thrust him into a well designing to drown him therein, but Allah
Almighty preserved his life and brought him forth the pit and our
Lord favoured him and restored to him his two eyes and empowered
him over the kingdom and thus did he become Sovran
and Sultan. Now the prosperity of that Shaykh Mohsin was from
the well whereinto Musa had thrust him.” Presently he added, “An
this tale be soothfast, then am I Mohsin and thou art Musa the
Malignant. I am able at this moment to slay thee but I will spare
thee and moreover counsel thee as follows:—Do thou go to the
well and haply Almighty Allah shall thereby grant to thee some
good, for that the root of my fair fortune was from that same
pit.” Now when the first third of the night had sped, Musa arose
and repaired to the pit and descended therein when behold, the
same two Jinnis had forgathered beside the well-mouth at that
same hour and were seated together conversing each with other.
Quoth the first, “What is thy case this day?” and quoth the
second, “By Allah, O my brother, my condition is ill-conditioned
ever since a certain night when we met in this place and talked
together. And so it hath continued until the present time, for that
I have been unable to approach the city wherein dwelleth the
Sultan’s daughter: and someone that was in the well must have
overheard us whilst we knew naught of him and he must have
acted according to our words and slaughtered the black cock;
after which I have been unable to near her abode.” Quoth the
other, “By Allah, O my brother, thou has spoken sooth; but our
ill-constraint is from this well.” Hereupon the Jinni put forth his
hand about the pit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7554" id="noteref-7554" epub:type="noteref">7554</a> and finding Musa the Misdoer snatched him
up and seizing him between his palms tore his body into four
pieces and cast away the quarters in some desert stead. And
this (said Shahrazad) is the award of whoso betrayeth his fellow
man. And they also relate the adventure of</p>
