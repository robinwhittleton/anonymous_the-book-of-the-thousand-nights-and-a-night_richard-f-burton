<p>Whilome there was, men say, a Khwajah, a merchant man who
was lord of money and means and estates and endowments and
appanages, withal he had no seed, or son or daughter, and therefore
he sued Almighty Allah that he might be blessed with even
a girl-child to inherit his good and keep it together. Suddenly
he heard a Voice bespeak him in dreamery saying, “Ho Such-an-one,
Predestination overcometh Prudence and resignation to
the trials sent by Allah is foremost and fairest.” Hearing this
he arose without stay or delay and casually<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7598" id="noteref-7598" epub:type="noteref">7598</a> slept with his wife
who, by decree of the Decreer and by allowance of Allah
Almighty, conceived that very night. When she became pregnant
and the signs of gestation showed in her, the merchant
rejoiced and distributed and doled and did alms-deeds; and, as
soon as her tale of days was fulfilled, there befel her what befalleth
womankind of labour-pangs, and parturition came with its madding
pains and the dolours of delivery, after which she brought forth
a girl-babe moulded in mould of beauty and loveliness and showing
promise of brilliance and stature and symmetric grace. Now
on the night after the birth and when it was the middle thereof,
the Merchant was sitting at converse beside his wife and suddenly
he again heard the Voice announcing to him that his daughter was
fated to become a mother in illicit guise by the son of a King who
reigned in the region Al-Irak. He turned him towards the sound
but could see no man at such time, and presently he reflected that
between his city and the capital of the King’s son in Al-Irak was
a distance of six months and a moiety. Now the night wherein the
Merchant’s wife became a mother was the same when the King’s wife
of Al-Irak bare a boy-heir, and the Merchant, albe he wist naught
thereof, was seized with trembling and terror at the words of the
Voice and said in himself, “How shall my daughter forgather with
the King’s son in question when between us and him is a travel of
six months and a half? What can be such case? But haply this
Voice is of a Satan!” As soon as it was morning-tide the father
summoned astrologers and men who compute horoscopes and scribes
who cast lots,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7599" id="noteref-7599" epub:type="noteref">7599</a> and when they presented themselves he informed
them that a daughter had been added to his household and his aim
was to see what the prognostic<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7600" id="noteref-7600" epub:type="noteref">7600</a> might be. Hereupon all and
every wrought at his art and mystery, and it was shown that the
Merchant’s daughter would become a mother by the son of a King
and this would be in the way of unright: but so far from informing
him of this or suffering him to learn concerning of her circumstance
they said, “The future none wotteth it save Allah Almighty and
our craft at times proveth soothfast and at times falsifieth us.”
However the Khwajah’s heart was on no wise satisfied and he
ceased not to suffer patiently nor did rest repose him nor were meat
and sleep to him sweet for the space of two years, during which his
daughter was suckled and in due time was weaned. The father
never ceased pondering how he should act towards his child and
at sundry times he would say, “Let us slay her and rest from
her,” and at other times he would exclaim, “Let us remove her to a
stead where none shall approach her or of man-kind or of Jinn-kind.”
Withal did none point out a path to pursue nor did any
guide him to any course of the courses he might adopt. Now one
day of the days he fared forth his house unknowing whither he
should wend and he stinted not wending until he found himself
without the town,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Khwajah
stinted not wending until he found himself without the town,
where he was expectedly met by a wight in Darwaysh-garb to
whom he salam’d and by whom he was saluted. Presently the
holy man turned to the merchant and seeing him changed of
colour and conduct asked him, “What is with thee to do, and what
ill hast thou to rue that thy case and complexion are so changed
to view?” “O Fakir,” answered the other, “verily a matter of
marvel hath betided me and I know not how to act therein.”
Quoth the ghostly man, “And what may that be?” whereupon
the Merchant related to him all his affair first and last, and how
he had heard a Voice saying to him, “In very deed thy daughter
shall conceive after unlawful fashion by the King’s son of Al-Irak.”
The Darwaysh was surprised on hearing these words
from him and said in his thought, “There is no averting of
adversity foredoomed and Allah will do whatso he will;” presently
adding, “O Khwajah, in yonder direction riseth a mountain
Jabal al-Saháb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7601" id="noteref-7601" epub:type="noteref">7601</a> hight, which is impenetrable or to mankind or to
Jinn-kind; but given thou avail to reach it thou wilt find therein
and about the middle combe thereof a vast cavern two miles in
breadth by an hundred long. Here, an thou have in thee force
and thou attain thereto and lodge thy daughter, haply shall Allah
Almighty conserve and preserve the maid from what evils thou
heardest the Voice declare to thee for her destiny: however, thou
shalt on no wise reach those highlands until thou shalt have
expended thereon a matter of much money. Moreover at the
head and front of that cave<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7602" id="noteref-7602" epub:type="noteref">7602</a> is an inner crevice which, extending
to the mountain-top, admitteth daylight into its depths and displayeth
a small pavilion by whose side be five-fold pleasaunce-gardens
with flowers and fruits and rills and trees besprent and
birds hymning Allah, the One, the Omnipotent. Now an thou
avail to convey thy daughter to that place, she shall dwell there
secure, safe-guarded.” As soon as the Khwajah heard those
words from the Fakir, there faded from his heart whatso there
was of thought and forethought and cark and care and he took
the hand of the Religious whom he led to his home and honoured
him and robed him, for that he had indicated such place of protection.
When the maiden reached the age of five and had waxed
killing in beauty, her father brought her a learned Divine with
whom she began reading and who taught her the Koran and
writing and the art of caligraphy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7603" id="noteref-7603" epub:type="noteref">7603</a> and when she had seen the
first decade, she fell to studying astrology and astronomy and the
aspect of the Heavens. Such was her case; but as regards that
of her sire the Merchant, from the hour he forgathered with the
Darwaysh he ceased not to hold him in his heart and presently he
proposed to take him and travel with him to the mountain aforementioned.
So they set out together and when they reached it
they found it a site right strong as though fortified, and entering
the antre they fell to considering it right and left till they
reached its head where they came upon the little pavilion. After
all this quoth the Fakir, “Indeed such stead shall safe-guard thy
daughter from the shifts of the Nights and the Days;” withal
was he unknowing that the Decreed be determined and must perforce
be done, albeit Doom be depending from the skirts of the
clouds.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7604" id="noteref-7604" epub:type="noteref">7604</a> And the Religious ceased not showing the site until he
caused his companion enter the parterres, which he found as they
had been described to him with flowers and fruits and streams and
trees besprent and birds hymning the One, the Omnipotent. As
soon as they had finished solacing themselves with the sights, they
fared back to their town where, during their absence-term, the
damsel’s mother had made ready for them viaticum and presents,
and by the time the twain returned they found ready to hand
everything of travel-gear and all the wants of wayfare. So they
equipped themselves and set forth, taking with them the maiden
together with five white slave-girls and ten negresses and as many
sturdy black chattels who loaded the packs upon the mules’ and
the camels’ backs. Then they fell to cutting across the wilds and
wolds, each and everyone intent upon ministering to the maiden,
and they ceased not faring until they drew near the mountain, and
they took station by the cavern-door. Here they unloaded the
bales and burthens and transported them to the pavilion within
the cave, after which the Merchant’s daughter went in and as she
walked forwards fell to gazing, rightwards and leftwards, until such
time as she had reached the pavilion. Presently she found it
poikilate of corners and columns, and she was assured that the
distance of that mountain from her father’s town measured the
march of a full-told month. And whenas she had taken seat and
had settled in that pavilion, her father considered the unapproachable
nature of the place and waxed contented of heart and his
mind became right of rede, because he was certified of his daughter
that she was safe from the tricks of Time and every trickster.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7605" id="noteref-7605" epub:type="noteref">7605</a> So
he tarried beside her for a decade of days, after which he farewelled
her and wended him home, leaving the damsel in the mountain-cave.
Thus fared it with these; but as regards the case of the
Prince of Al-Irak, his father who owned no issue, or man-child or
girl-child, lay sleeping one night of the nights when, lo and behold!
he heard the words, “All things befal by Fate and Fortune.” Hereat
he arose from slumber being sore startled and cried, “Laud to the
Lord whom I have heard say<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7606" id="noteref-7606" epub:type="noteref">7606</a> that all things depend upon Doom
and Destiny.” On the next night he slept with his spouse who by
leave of Almighty Allah forthright conceived. When her pregnancy
became manifest the Sovran rejoiced and he scattered and largessed
and doled alms-deeds to the widows and paupers and the mean
and miserable; and he sued the Creator on high saying, “O Lord
vouchsafe to me a man-boy which may succeed me in the reign,
and deign Thou make him a child of life.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7607" id="noteref-7607" epub:type="noteref">7607</a> But when the Queen’s
time had sped she was seized by labour-pangs and delivery-pains,
after which she bare a babe—Glory be to God who created him
and confirmed what He had wrought in the creation of that child
who was like unto a slice of the moon! They committed him to
the wet-nurses who fell to suckling him and tending him and
fondling him till the milk-term was completed, and when his age
had reached the sixth year, his father brought for him a Divine
perfect in knowledge of all the sciences, spiritual and temporal,
and the craft of penmanship and what not. Accordingly, the boy
began to read and study under his learner until he had excelled
him in every line of lore, and he became a writer deft, doughty in
all the arts and sciences: withal his sire knew not that was doomed
to him of dule and dolours.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
became a penman doughty in all knowledge, withal he wist not
that was written for him of dule and dolours. This lasted until
his tenth year, and the old King rejoiced in him and caused him
to back steeds until he had mastered all of horsemanship, and he
waxed accomplished in hunting and birding and he had attained
the bourne of <i><span xml:lang="la">omnis res scibilis</span></i>. Every morning he would superintend
the governance of his sire in the office of Commandments
and direct him to affairs wherein lay rede that was right until,
one day of the days, his parent said to him “O my son, do thou
rule for a day and I will govern on the next.” “O my father,”
said he, “I am young of years nor is it meet that I meddle with
public matters or sit in thy Divan.” Now when he reached the
age of fourteen and had entered upon man’s estate and had waxed
perfect in the words of ordinance and had become complete and
sanspareil in beauty and loveliness, the King resolved upon
marrying him, but he consented not, nor did his heart incline to
womankind for the being in the All-Knowledge of Almighty
Allah all that was foredoomed to him from Time beginningless.
Presently on a chance day his nature longed for the hunt and
chase, and he asked leave of his sire who consented not, fearing
for his safety; but he said in himself, “An I go not I will slay
myself;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7608" id="noteref-7608" epub:type="noteref">7608</a> and so he privily apprized of his intent a party of
his dependents who, all and every, prepared to ride forth with
him into the Desert. Now the King had in his stables a stallion,
known as Abú Hamámah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7609" id="noteref-7609" epub:type="noteref">7609</a> which was kept alone in a smaller
stall, and he was chained by four chains to a like number of
posts<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7610" id="noteref-7610" epub:type="noteref">7610</a> and was served by two grooms who never could draw
nigh to him or let him loose; nor could any, save only his lord,
approach him with bridle or saddle or aught of horse-gear. But
when the Prince had designed to fare forth a-hunting and
a-birding, he went in to his father’s steed Abu Hamamah by hest
of Allah Almighty’s might over him and for what was hidden to
him in the Future, and found him chained and tethered; and, as the
horse pleased him and affected his fancy, he approached him and
gentled him with caressing hands. The stallion also at that time
under decree of Destiny was influenced by the Lord and directed
towards the Prince for the sake of that which was hidden from
him in the World of Secrets. So he continued to gentle the
animal and to caress him and to make much of him, and he was
ever the more pleased with him, and said to himself, “Verily my
riding forth to the hunt and chase shall not be save upon this
stallion;” and he ceased not pacing and pressing around him,
soothing him the while, until the steed showed subjection and
neither started nor lashed-out nor indeed moved a limb, but stood
like a man obedient and dependent. And when the youth’s
glance wandered around he saw beside the stallion a closet, and
as he neared it and opened it he found therein all manner harness
and equipments, such as a saddle complete with its girths and
shovel-stirrups and bit and bridle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7611" id="noteref-7611" epub:type="noteref">7611</a> whilst on every side was gear
of warfare enfolded in the furniture, such as scymitar and dagger;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7612" id="noteref-7612" epub:type="noteref">7612</a>
and a pair of pistols. So he wondered at this circumstance of
the horse how that none could draw near him or place upon him
that harness, and he likewise marvelled at the subjection of the
steed to himself. Hereupon he carried the furniture from the
closet and going forth with it walked up to the Father of a
Pigeon, which was somewhat fearful of him and affrighted, and he
uplifted the saddle and threw it upon his back, and girthed him
tight and bridled him with the bit, when the horse became
adorned as a bride who is displayed upon her throne. Now the
King’s son at times enquired of himself saying, “An I loose this
horse from his chains he will start away from me;” and at other
times quoth he, “At this hour the stallion will not think of bolting
from me,” and on this wise he abode between belief and unbelief
in his affair. And he stinted not asking of himself until his suite
was a-weary of waiting and of looking at him, so they sent to him
praying that he would hurry, and he said in his thought, “I place
my trust in Allah, for the Forewritten hath no flight therefrom.”
Anon he loosed the stallion’s chains after harnessing and girthing
him straitly; then, throwing his right leg over his back<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7613" id="noteref-7613" epub:type="noteref">7613</a> mounted
thereupon with a spring and settled himself in selle and came forth.
And all who looked at that steed were unable to stand upon
the road until the Prince had ridden forwards and had overtaken
the rest of his suite without the town, whence they sought the
hunting-grounds. But when they were amiddlemost the waste
lands and beyond sight of the city, the courser glanced right and
left and tossed his crest and neighed and snorted and ran away;
then shaking his head and buck-jumping under the son of
the Sultan bolted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7614" id="noteref-7614" epub:type="noteref">7614</a> with him until he became like a bird
whereof is seen no trace nor will trick avail to track.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7615" id="noteref-7615" epub:type="noteref">7615</a> When his
folk beheld him they were impotent to govern their horses until
their lord had vanisht from their view, nor had anyone the muscle
or the manhood to keep up pursuit. So waxing perplext and
wildered in their wits they sought counsel one of other saying,
“Let each and every of us ride by a separate road until such a
day when haply we shall meet him.” Hereupon the whole party
dispersed and all took their own directions seeking the Prince; and
they stinted not search, anon putting out to speed and anon retracing
their steps<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7616" id="noteref-7616" epub:type="noteref">7616</a> and then returning by the same road. This
endured for five days when not a soul came upon their liege lord,
so they waxed distraught nor could they find right guidance to
aught they should do. However when the trysting-day came, all
gathered together and said, “Fare we to the Sultan and acquaint
we him with this and let him devise a device for the matter of his
son; because this youth is his father’s prop and stay, nor owneth
he any other than this one.” Hereupon they set out citywards
and ceased not riding until they drew near the capital where they
found a marquee pitched without the walls, and having considered
it they knew it to be the King’s own. So they drew near it and
there found the Chamberlains and Nabobs and officers of high commandment
standing round about it, and when they asked saying,
“What is the cause for setting up yonder tent in such place?” they
were answered, “Verily, whenas his son fared from him designing
to hunt and bird, on the next day his heart was straitened for the
Youth and he wist not what had befallen him. On the first night
when the Prince fared forth from him and disappeared, all went
well, but on the second his breast was straitened and in his vitals
he sensed a change and ’twas at the hour when the stallion began
buck-jumping with his child and running away. Anon he lost all
patience and was unable to endure session within his Palace so he
commanded pitch his pavilion without the walls and here we have
been sitting for a space of six days, awaiting the escort to return.”
As the party drew near the marquee the bruit of them went abroad
until it came to the King’s ears.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
feeling his breast a-straitened bade pitch his pavilion without the
walls and tarried therein for a space of six days and on the seventh
appeared his son’s suite which had been left behind when the horse
ran away with the Prince, nor did any know what direction the
beast had taken. As soon as the bruit went abroad and came to
the ears of the bereaved father, he cried out with a single outcry
and fell to the ground aswoon, and the fainting fit lasted for two
days. But when he came to himself and asked after his son, the
suite reported all that had befallen the youth from the stallion and
at that moment the King recalled to mind the Voice which had
spoken saying, “All things befal by Fate and Fortune;” and had
declared, “Resignation to the trials sent by Allah is first and best
till such time as Destiny shall win to her end.” “If” (he mused)
“my lot be forgathering with him anywheres then needs must it
be; and, if otherwise, we will be patient under the All-might of
Allah Most Highest.” Such was the case with these; but as
concerns the young Prince,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7617" id="noteref-7617" epub:type="noteref">7617</a> when the stallion started off with him
and bolted and became like a bird flying between the firmament
and terra firma, he suffered nor fatigue nor emotion, nay, he sat
contented upon the beast’s back, for that had he hent in hand a
cup full of coffee naught thereof would have been spilt. And the
stallion ceased not galloping at speed with him through the livelong
day until night came on when, seeing a lake, he halted by the
side of it. The Prince thereupon dismounted and withdrawing
the bridle offered him water which he drank; then he foddered
him with forage which he ate, for our Lord had subjected to him
that steed till it became between his hands like one familiar from
the first and, as the youth had somewhat of provaunt in his
budget he drew forth of it and took food. But the Prince knew
not whither the horse was minded to bear him and the Fiat of
Fate drove him to the matter foredoomed to him from Eternity.
So after that time as often as he mounted and let loose the bridle
thongs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7618" id="noteref-7618" epub:type="noteref">7618</a> the horse paced unguided on those wilds and wastes
and hills and dales and stony leas, and whenever they drew near
a city or a town the son of the Sultan dismounted from his steed;
and, leaving him where he was, went into the streets in order to
bring provaunt and forage, after which he could return to his beast
and feed him in the same place. And he ceased not wayfaring
until he drew near a city where he designed to dismount as was
his wont and lay in somewhat of vivers and fodder, so he alighted
and leaving his horse outside the houses he went in to satisfy his
need. Now by the decree of the Decreer the King of that Capital
had left it on an excursion to hunt and bird, and he chanced return
at that moment and as he drew near the walls behold, he found
the steed standing alone and harnessed with trappings fit for the
Kings. The Sultan was astounded when he looked upon this
and being on horseback himself he designed to draw near and
catch the animal, and when he came close he put forth his hand.
But the steed was scared with the scaring of a camel, and the King
bade his followers form ring around him and seize him; so they
gat about him and designed to catch him and lead him away, when
suddenly the steed screamed a scream which resounded throughout
the city and when the horses heard the cry of that stallion they
turned with their riders in headlong flight and dispersed one from
other. And amongst them was the Sultan, who, when his courser
ran away with him, strove hard to pull him up and control him,
but he lost all power and whilst the rest of the horses were
trembling under their riders he swooned and fell to the ground.
Presently the followers came to his aid and found him in fainting
condition, so they propped him up and sprinkled somewhat of
water upon him, when he recovered and asked them, “Where is
the horse?” Answered they, “He is still standing in the same
place;” and quoth he, “Walláhi, needs must this affair have a
cause, and do ye lie awaiting him and see whither he will wend,
for this beast God wots must be of the Jinns.” On this wise it
befel them; but as regards the horse’s owner, the son of the
Sultan, when he entered the city seeking to buy somewhat of
victual and fodder, he heard the scream of the steed and recognised
it, but of the city-folk all who had hearkened to that outcry felt
their hearts fluttering with extreme affright; so each one rose and
padlocked his shop and hardly believed that he could reach his
house in safety and this continued until the capital (even within its
bazars) became empty like a waste, a ruin. Hereupon quoth the
youth, “By Allah, needs must some matter of the matters have
befallen the horse,” and so saying he went forth the city and
walked on till he neared the site where he had left the steed when,
behold, he came suddenly upon a party of people in the middlemost
whereof appeared one sitting and trembling in all his limbs,
and he saw the attendants standing about him and each one
holding in hand a horse. So he drew near him and asked him
what was to do and they acquainted him with the affair of the
stallion and his scream and the cause of the man being seated;
and this was none other than the Sultan who had been seized with
affright and had fainted at the outcry of the Father of a Pigeon.
Hereupon he fell to conversing with them and they knew not that
he was the owner of the steed until such time as he asked them,
“And doth not any of you avail to draw near him?” Answered
they, “O Youth, indeed there is none who can approach him.”
Quoth he, “This is a matter which is easy to us and therein is no
hindrance;” and so saying he left them and turned towards the
courser who no sooner saw him than he shook his head at him;
and he approached the beast and fell to stroking his coat and
kissing him upon the brow. After this he strewed somewhat of
fodder before him and offered him water and the stallion ate and
drank until he was satisfied. All this and the suite of the Sultan
was looking on at the Prince and presently informed their lord,
saying, “O King of the Age, a Youth hath come to us and asked
as for information touching this steed and when we told him what
had happened he approached him and gentled him and bussed
him on the brow; and after that he strewed before him somewhat
of forage which he ate and gave him water to drink and still he
standeth hard by him.” When the Sultan heard these words he
marvelled and cried, “By Allah, indeed this is a wondrous matter,
but do ye fare to him and bring him to me, him and his horse;
and, if he make aught delay with you, seize and pinion him and
drag him before me debased and degraded and in other than plight
pleasurable!”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine,

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King sent
to his suite bidding them bring the owner of that stallion adding,
“If he make aught delay with you drag him before me debased
and degraded, and in other than pleasurable plight.” Accordingly,
they went to him and accosting him said, “O Youth, thou owest
hearing and obeying to His Highness the King; and, if thou come
not to him with good gree we will bear thee maugre thyself.” But
the Prince, hearing these their words, set his left foot in stirrup and
throwing his right leg over the saddle mounted till he was firm of
seat upon his stallion’s back and had power over his monture.
Then he asked saying, “Who amongst you shall come near me
or carry me to yonder Sultan of yours?” Whenas they saw this
from him they kept away from his arm-reach, but inasmuch as
they could not return to their King and report saying, “We availed
not to bring him,” they exclaimed, “Allah upon thee, O Youth,
that thou draw nigh with us to the Sovran and bespeak him from
the back of thy steed: so shall we be clear and bear nor rebuke
nor reproach.” Hearing this much the Prince understood what
was in their thoughts and that their design was to win free of the
King and the avoidance of blame; accordingly he said to them;
“Fare ye before me and I will follow you.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7619" id="noteref-7619" epub:type="noteref">7619</a> But when they
returned with the youth behind them to within a short distance of
the King where either of the twain could hear the other’s words,
the Prince asked, “O King of the Age, what dost thou require of
me and what is it thou wantest?” “Do thou dismount,” answered
the Sultan, “and draw near me when I will tell thee and question
thee of a certain matter:” but quoth the youth, “I will not alight
from the back of my steed and let whoso hath a claim upon me
demand satisfaction,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7620" id="noteref-7620" epub:type="noteref">7620</a> for here be the Maydán—the field of fight.”
So saying he wheeled his steed and would have made for the open
country, when the Sultan cried aloud to his followers, “Seize him
and bring him hither.” So they took horse all of them, a matter
of one hundred and fifty riders, and followed him at full speed
(he still riding) and overtook him and formed a ring around him,
and he seeing this shortened the bridle-reins and gored flanks with
stirrup-irons when the beast sprang from under him like the wafting
of the wind. Then he cried out to them, “Another day, O ye
dogs;” and no sooner had they heard his outcry than they turned
from him flying and to safety hieing. When the Sultan beheld
his followers, some hundred and fifty riders, returning to the
presence in headlong flight and taking station before him, he
enquired the cause of their running, and they replied that none
could approach that horseman, adding, “Verily he cried a warcry
which caused each and every of us to turn and flee, for that we
deemed him one of the Jánn.” “Woe to you!” exclaimed the
King: “an hundred and fifty riders and not avail to prevail over
a single horseman!” presently adding, “By Allah, his say was
sooth who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And how many an one in the tribe they count ✿ When to one a thousand shall ne’er amount?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Verily this youth could not be confronted by a thousand, nor
indeed could a whole tribe oppose him, and by Allah, I have been
deficient in knightly devoir for not doing him honour; however, it
was not to be save on such wise.” But the youth ceased not faring
through days and nights for the whole of four months, unknowing
the while when he should reach a place wherein to take repose.
And as soon as this long wayfare ended, suddenly a mountain
towering high to the heights of heaven arose before him; so he
set his face thither, and after a further term of three days<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7621" id="noteref-7621" epub:type="noteref">7621</a> (and
he ever wayfaring) he reached it and beheld upon its flanks fair
leasows with grasses and rills and trees and fruits besprent, and
birds hymning Allah the One, the Omnipotent. Anon he alighted
therein for that his heart had somewhat to say anent that mountain,
and he also marvelled thereat by cause that during his wayfare he
had never seen aught like it at all, nor anything resembling that
herbage and those streams. And after dismounting he unbridled
his steed and suffered him browse and pasture upon the greenery
and drink of the water, while he on like wise fell to eating of the
fruits which hung from the trees and taking his ease and repose.
But the more he shifted from place to place the fairer he found it
than the first, so he was delighted with the site, and as he looked
upon it he improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O who fearest the world do thou feel right safe; ✿ Trust all to Him did mankind create:</div>
      <div class="line">Fate aye, O my lord, shall come to pass ✿ While safe thou art from th’ undoomed by Fate.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The Sultan’s son ceased not straying from stead to stead for a
term of ten days, during which he wandered round about the
Mountain and solaced himself by gazing upon the trees and
waters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7622" id="noteref-7622" epub:type="noteref">7622</a> and he was gladdened by the warbling of the birds till at
length the Doom of Destiny and the Fiat of Fate cast him over
against the door of the cave which contained the Khwajah’s
daughter with her handmaids and her negro slaves. He looked
at the entrance and marvelled and was perplexed at——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
King’s son took place before the Cavern-door he marvelled at its
strength intended to protect those within, but he knew not if it
had any inmate or an it were void of inhabitants, seeing that the
mountain was far distant and divided from towns and cities nor
could any avail to reach it. So he said in his mind, “Sit thee
down here over against the entrance amid these grasses and trees
and fruits, for an thou quit this site thou shalt find none like it in
charms and eke it shall console thee for parting from thy people.
Moreover, haply shall someone of this place pass by me and from
him I may ask tidings concerning this region and peradventure
Almighty Allah shall guide me back to my own country and I
shall forgather with my father and my folk and my friends.
Indeed possibly there may be someone within this place who
when he issueth forth shall become my familiar.” So he ceased
not sitting at the door of the cave for a term of twenty days
eating of the fruits of the trees and drinking of the water of the
rain pools as likewise did his steed; but when it was the twenty
and first day, behold, the door of the antre was thrown open and
there came forth it two black slave-girls and a negro chattel,
followed five white hand-maidens, all seeking diversion and
disport among those meadows which lay on the mountain-flank
and beyond. But as they paced along their eyes fell on the son of
the Sultan who was still sitting there with his steed before him
and they found him cast in the mould of beauty and loveliness,
for he had now rested in that place from his wayfare and the
perfection of charms was manifest upon him. When the slave-girls
looked at him they were overwhelmed by the marvels of
his comeliness and shapeliness and they returned in haste and
hurry to their mistress and said to her, “O our lady, verily at
the cavern-door is a Youth, never saw we a fairer than he or a
seemlier of semblance, and in very deed he resembleth thee in
grace and elegance of face and form, and before him standeth a
steed even as a bride.” Now when the Merchant’s daughter heard
these words from her handmaidens, she arose and in haste and
hurry made for the cave-door and her heart was filled with
gladness and she ceased not walking till she reached it. Then
she looked upon the Prince and came forward and embraced him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7623" id="noteref-7623" epub:type="noteref">7623</a>
and gave him the salam and she continued to gaze upon and
consider his beauty and comeliness, until love to him settled in her
heart and likewise the Prince’s love to her increased. Hereupon
she hent him by the hand and led him into the cavern where he
fell to looking rightwards and leftwards about the sides thereof
and wondering at what he saw therein of pleasaunces and trees
and streams and birds, until at last they reached the pavilion.
But before entering thither the Prince had led his horse and loosed
him in the leasows which lay in the cavern; and, when at last the
twain ended at the palace and went within, the attendants brought
meat for him; so he ate his sufficiency and they washed his hands
and then the couple fell to conversing together whilst all were
delighted with the son of the King. And they continued in such
case until night drew nigh when each of the handmaidens went to
her chamber and lay her down and on like wise did the black
slaves until there remained none save the Prince and the
Merchant’s daughter. Then began she to excite him and incite
him and disport with him until his heart inclined towards her by
reason of her toyings and her allurements, so he drew near to her
and clasped her to his breast and at last he threw her upon her
back and did away her maidenhead. Now by hest of Allah
Almighty’s All-might she conceived of him that very night and
they ceased not to be in sport and laughter until the Creator
brought on the dawn which showed its sheen and shone and the
sun arose over lowland and lawn. Then did the twain, she and
he, sit communing together, when the girl began to improvise
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Loving maid in obedience doth come ✿ Trailing skirt with her pride all astir;</div>
      <div class="line">And she’s meet for no man save for him ✿ And he’s meet for no maid save for her.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7624" id="noteref-7624" epub:type="noteref">7624</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After this the Khwajah’s daughter tarried with the King’s son for
a term of six months; but, from the night when he had abated her
pucelage, he never approached her at all, and she also on like wise
felt no lust of the flesh for him in any way nor did she solicit him
to love-liesse.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7625" id="noteref-7625" epub:type="noteref">7625</a> But when it was the seventh month, the youth
remembered his family and native land and he sought leave of her
to travel but she said to him, “Why dost thou not tarry beside
us?” Said he, “If in our life there be due length needs must we
forgather.” Then asked she, “O my lord, who mayest thou be?”
so he declared to her his pedigree and degree and the name of his
native country and she also informed him of her rank and lineage
and her patrial stead. Presently he farewelled her and mounting
his horse fared forth from her in early morning,——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive.”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King’s son
farewelled the Merchant’s daughter and fared forth from her in
early morning, seeking his folk and his natal land, and he drove
amiddlemost the wilds and the wolds. On this wise it was
with him; but as regards the merchant, the father of the damsel,
he and the Darwaysh after consigning her to the cavern returned
to his town and there spent six months in business as was his
wont; but on the seventh he called to mind his child and was
desolated by her absence because he had none other. So quoth
he to her mother, “I have an intent to visit the girl and look upon
her and see what may be her condition, for my heart is in sore
doubt on her account and I cannot but fancy that some unforeseen
casualty hath brought calamity or that some wayfarer may have
visited her; and my thoughts are occupied with her, so ’tis my
will to fare forth and see her.” “Such act were advisable,” quoth
the wife; and so saying she fell to making him somewhat of provaunt
amounting to some ten camel-loads.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7626" id="noteref-7626" epub:type="noteref">7626</a> Presently he led forth
with him a few of his negro slaves and set out to see his daughter
on the Jabal al-Saháb. So he dove into the depths of the desert
and cut across the dales and the hills and conjoined the
journeyings of night with day for a space of three months, and
about sunset-tide on the first of the fourth behold, a rider appeared
to him coming from the breast of the waste, nor had he with him
anyone. When the stranger drew near, the Khwajah saluted him
and his salam was returned by the horseman who happened to be
the Prince returning from the Merchant’s daughter. Quoth the
Khwajah, “O Youth, dismount with us in this place and let us
twain, I and thou, night together and solace ourselves with converse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7627" id="noteref-7627" epub:type="noteref">7627</a>
then, when it shall be morning, each of us shall depart seeking
his own stead.” Quoth the Prince, “No harm in that,” and so
saying he sprang from the back of his steed and unbridled him and
suffered him to browse upon the grasses and greenery together
with the Khwajah’s cattle. Hereat the two sat down together in
talk while the slaves slaughtered a lamb and flayed it, then, having
lighted a fire, they set the meat thereupon in a chauldron and
when it was cooked they fished it out with a flesh-hook and scored
it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7628" id="noteref-7628" epub:type="noteref">7628</a> and placed it in a mighty platter which they served up to their
lord and the King’s son. Both ate of it after the measure of their
sufficiency and the remnants were borne off by the slaves for their
suppers. And when the time for night-prayers came, the two
having made the Wuzú ablution performed the orisons obligatory
upon them, and anon sat down for evening converse, overtalking
the tidings of the world and its affairs, until quoth the Merchant
to the Prince, “O Youth, whence comest thou and whither art
thou wending?” Quoth the other, “Walláhi, O Khwajah, I have
a wondrous tale, nay a marvel of marvels which, were it graved
with needle-gravers upon the eye-corners were a warning to whoso
would be warned. And this it is, I am the King’s son of Al-Irak
and my sire’s prop and stay in the House of the World, and he
reared me with the fairest of rearing; but when I had grown to
man’s estate and had learnt the mysteries of venerie I longed one
chance day of the days to ride forth hunting and birding. So I
went for a horse (as was my wont) to the stables, where I found
yon stallion which is with me chained to four posts; whereupon of
my ignorance, unknowing that none could approach him save
myself nor any avail to mount him, I went up to him and girthed
him, and he neither started nor moved at my gentling of him, for
this was existing in the purpose of Almighty Allah. Then I
mounted him and sought my suite without informing my sire and
rode forth the city with all my many, when suddenly the horse
snorted with his nostrils and neighed through his throttle and
buckjumped in air and bolted for the wilderness swift as bird in
firmament-plain, nor wist I whither he was intending.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7629" id="noteref-7629" epub:type="noteref">7629</a> He ceased
not running away with me the whole day till eventide when we
reached a lake in a grassy mead.” (Now when the Khwajah
heard the words of the Prince his heart was heartened and
presently the other pursued), “So I took seat and ate somewhat
of my vivers, my horse also feeding upon his fodder, and we
nighted in that spot and next morning I set out and stinted not
riding for a march of four months. But on the first of the fifth
I neared a towering mountain whose length and whose breadth
had no bounds, and on its flanks I found leasows manifold with
trees and fruits and streams besprent and birds hymning the One,
the Omnipotent. So I was gladdened by the sight and dismounted
and unbridled my steed whom I allowed to browse the while I ate
of the fruits, and presently I fell to roaming about from site to site.
And when some time had passed I came to the mouth of a cavern
whence after a short delay on my part fared forth slave-girls under
the escort of a negro chattel. When they beheld me they rejoiced
in me, then going in they disappeared for an hour and anon
returned bringing a young lady as she was the moon of the fourteenth
night, who salam’d to me, and invited me to become her
guest and led me into the cave”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Eight Hundred and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
continued to the Merchant saying:—The slave-girls invited me and
led me into the cave until I reached a Pavilion that was there. I
tarried beside them for a matter of some six months when I felt
desolate for my folk and my native land, so I craved leave to depart
from them and farewelled them and went forth, they sending me
away with highmost honour. But when bidding them good-bye,
I covenanted with them saying, “an there be in life any length
needs must we forgather; and with these words I left them, and
now ’tis some time since I journeyed thence when thou mettest me
in this place.” Now the Merchant hearing his tale knew from the
beginning what had occurred there, and was certified of the saying
of the Voice, and judging from the tenor of the information said
in his mind, “There is no doubt or hesitation but that this be the
youth to whom was appointed my daughter, that of him she should
conceive in the way of unright and the Written<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7630" id="noteref-7630" epub:type="noteref">7630</a> is now fulfilled.”
So quoth the Merchant, “O Youth, where is thy town?” and he
informed him thereof. Now the Prince knew not that he had come
upon the damsel’s father by the road, whereas the Khwajah wotted
right well that this man had had to do with his daughter. As
soon as it was morning the twain farewelled each other and either
of them went his own way; but, the Khwajah fell into cark and
care such as cannot be conceived, and he fasted from food nor was
meat to him sweet nor was sleep. However, he ceased not travelling
till he arrived at the Jabal al-Sahab, when he approached the door
of the cave and rapped thereat. The handmaidens opened to him
and as soon as they saw his face they recognised him, and returning
to their lady informed her thereof: so she arose to seek him,
and presently met him and salam’d to him and kissed his hands
and walked by his side until she reached the Pavilion, where the
twain, he and she, went up, and she seated him and stood before
him in his suit and service. Hereat her father looked at her and
considered her and found her colour changed and her belly
grown big, and asked her, “What is to do with thee and what is’t
hath altered thy complexion, for to-day I see thee heavy of body,
and no doubt some man has mixed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7631" id="noteref-7631" epub:type="noteref">7631</a> with thee?” Now when she
heard the words of her father she understood and was certified
that he had compassed full knowledge concerning what had befallen
her, so she returned him nor answer nor address, and she was overwhelmed
with shame and confusion, and waxed changed and was
well nigh falling upon the floor. Presently she sat down in abashment
before her sire by reason of the bigness of her belly, but he
bowed in obedience before the power of Almighty Allah; and
they two ceased not conversing until fall of night, when each and
every of the handmaids had sought her own chamber that she
might sleep therein. As soon as the Khwajah remained alone
with his daughter and without other being present he said to her,
“O my child, verily this matter was foredoomed to thee from the
Lord of the Heavens, and there is no Averter of whatso is fated;
but do thou relate to me what befel between thee and the youth
who owneth the steed, and who is the King’s son of Al-Irak.”
Hereupon the girl was consterned and she could return no reply,
and presently when she recovered she said to her sire, “How shall
I relate to one who is already informed of all, first and last, and
thou declarest that the foredoomed must come to pass, nor can I
say thereanent a single word?” And presently she resumed, “O
my father, verily the Youth promised me that an his life have
length he would certainly forgather with me, and I desire of thee
that when thou shalt return to thy country thou take me and carry
me in thy company to him, and reunite me with him and let me
meet his sire and ask him to keep his word, for I require none else
nor shall anyone ever unveil me in privacy. And in fine do thou
marry me to him. Now whatso hath betided me thou hast heard
it from the Voice, and thou hast wearied thy soul in transporting
me to this place, fearing for me the shifts of the days, and thou
hast contraried the power of Allah, nor hath this profited thee
aught, because the Destinies which be writ upon mankind from
infinity and eternity must needs be carried out. All this was
determined by Allah, for that prosperity and adversity and benefaction
and interdiction all be from the Almighty. Do thou
whatso I have said and that which is inscribed upon my forehead
shall be the quickening of me (Inshallah—an so please God!),
since patience and longsuffering are better than restless thought.”
When her father heard from her such words, he agreed with her in
all she had spoken to him, and as soon as it was morning he fell to
preparing for wayfare, he and his daughter and his handmaidens
and his negro-slaves; and on the third day they loaded their loads
and set forth on return to their country and city. Then they conjoined
the travel of night and day and pushed forward on their
journey without stay or delay for a term of five months, until they
reached their home and settled them down therein. Such was
their case; but as regards the King’s son of Al-’Irak, after he had
met the girl’s father on the road and had parted from him, without
recognising him withal, he strave for return to his own land and
behold, he wandered from the way and was confronted by a sea
dashing with clashing billows. So he was perplext as to his affair
and his judgment left him and his right wits, and he knew not
what he should do or whither he should wend, or what direction
he should take or what Allah had decreed for him——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Third Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Prince came upon that sea he was perplext and wist not what to
do, so he leapt from the back of the Father of the Pigeon and set
his steed standing beside him that he might lean against his quarter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7632" id="noteref-7632" epub:type="noteref">7632</a>
when, of the excess of his night watching, he fell asleep and
was drowned in slumber. Then, by doom of Destiny the beast
shook his head and snorted and set off at full speed making for the
wild and the wold and was presently amiddlemost the waste. Now
when some two-told hours of time had passed, the Prince shook
off his drowsihead and opened his eyes, but of his steed he could
see nor sign nor aught of visible trace. So he smote hand upon
hand and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great,” after which he took seat by the
side of the sea and sued comfort of Almighty Allah. On the next
day a ship suddenly sailed in and made fast to the shore, after which
a posse of Jews landed from her and as soon as they saw him they
fell upon him and seized him and pinioned him; then, carrying
him perforce aboard, loaded his legs with irons. So quoth he to
himself, “Whenas Fate is so minded our eyes are blinded; however,
patience is fairest and of Allah must we ask aidance.” Hereupon
the Jews again disembarked and filled their kegs with the water
of an adjoining rain-pool, after which they trooped aboard and
making sail voyaged over the billows of the ocean before them.
This lasted for a month, after which time they cast anchor
beside a harbour-town, and presently swarmed out to sell and to
buy, and there they delayed for a term of two months until they
had finished their business and they had purchased them what
sufficed of provaunt. All this while the Prince lay bound in the
black hole deep down in the ship’s hold, nor did anyone go near
him save a Jew, a man of a certain age.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7633" id="noteref-7633" epub:type="noteref">7633</a> And whenever he
entered that dismal place he heard the youth reciting from the
Koran and he would stand to hearken until his heart was softened
to the speaker and he would favour him in the matter of meat and
drink. When they cast anchor beside the second place, the King’s
son asked the man, “What may be this port-city and what is her
name and the name of her ruler? Would Heaven I wot an her
lord be a King or a Governor under a royal hand?” “Wherefore
askest thou?” quoth the Jew, and quoth the other, “For nothing:
my only want is the city’s name<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7634" id="noteref-7634" epub:type="noteref">7634</a> and I would learn whether it
belong to Moslems or Jews or Nazarenes.” “This be peopled by
Moslem folk,” replied the Jew, “natheless can none carry tidings
of thee to her inhabitants. However, O Moslem, I feel a fondness
for thee and ’tis my intent when we reach the city of Andalús<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7635" id="noteref-7635" epub:type="noteref">7635</a> to
give tidings of thee, but it must be on condition that thou accept
of me to thy company whenas Allah Almighty shall have delivered
thee.” Said the Prince, “And what hindereth thee from Al-Islam
at this hour?” and said the other, “I am forbidden by fear of the
ship’s Captain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7636" id="noteref-7636" epub:type="noteref">7636</a>” Replied the Prince, “Become a Moslem in
secret and wash and pray in privacy beside me here.” So he
became of the True Believers at the hand of the King’s son,
who presently asked him, “Say me, be there in this vessel any
Moslems save myself?” “There are some twenty here,” answered
he, “and ’tis the design of the Captain to offer them up on
arrival at his own country and he shall devote them as victims
in the Greater Synagogue.” Rejoined the other, “Thou art now a
Moslem even as I am a Moslem, and it besitteth thou apprise me
of all and whatsoever befalleth in the ship, but first art thou
able to gar me forgather with the other True Believers?” And
the man answered in the affirmative. Now after the ship had
sailed with them for ten days, the whilome Jew contrived to
bring him and the Moslem prisoners together and they were found
to number twenty, each and every in irons. But when it was the
Sabbath about undurn hour, all the Jews including the Captain fell
to wine-bibbing and therein exceeded until the whole of them
waxed drunken; whereat the Prince and his convert arose, and
going to the armoury<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7637" id="noteref-7637" epub:type="noteref">7637</a> and opening it found therein all manner war-gear,
even habergeons. So the Youth returned to the captives and
unbinding their bonds, led them to the cabin of weapons and said
to them, “Do each and every of you who shall find aught befitting
take it and let such as avail to wear coat of mail seize one of them
and don it.” On this wise he heartened their hearts and cried to
them, “Unless ye do the deeds of men you will be slaughtered with
the slaughtering of sheep, for at this moment ’tis their design on
reaching their own land to offer you up as corbans in their Greater
Synagogue. So be you on your guard and, if ye fall in this affair,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7638" id="noteref-7638" epub:type="noteref">7638</a>
’tis fairer for you than to die with split weasands.” So each of
them snatched up whatso of war gear suited him and one equipped
other and they heartened their hearts and all waxed eager for the
fray. Then sallied they forth, one and twenty in number, at a
single word, with the Takbír and the Tahlíl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7639" id="noteref-7639" epub:type="noteref">7639</a> whilst the Jews who
formed the ship’s crew were some one hundred and five. But
these were all drunken with wine and giddy of head, nor did
they recover until the weapons began to play upon their necks and
their backs, whereat they shook off their crapulence and learned
that the Moslems had gotten about them with their war-gear.
So they cried out to one another and became ware and the
liquor-fumes left their brains. Then they rushed for the armoury
but found that most of the weapons were with the Moslems, whom
the Prince was urging to derring-do of cut and thrust. Thus
were they departed into two portions and hardly had passed an
hour, an hour which would grey the hair of a little child, in fight
and fray and onset and retreat——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
urged on his party and fortified their hearts to fight, nor had an
hour passed in battle and slaughter (and he smiting rightwards
and leftwards) when behold, he was encountered by the Captain
who sprang at him with his scymitar and designed to cut him
down. But he forestalled him with sway of sabre and smote him
a swashing stroke and an all-sufficient which share through his
joints and tare through his limbs; and when the ship’s crew saw
their Chief fall dead they gave in their submission<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7640" id="noteref-7640" epub:type="noteref">7640</a> and throwing
down their weapons would have saved their lives. The Prince,
however, went forward to them and fell to pinioning them, one
after other, until he had bound them all, after which he counted
them and found them to number about forty head while the slain
were three score and five. These he threw into the sea,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7641" id="noteref-7641" epub:type="noteref">7641</a> but the
captives he placed in prison after chaining them with iron chains
and they padlocked the doors upon them; and the Moslems
worked the ship’s sails while the man who had newly islamised
directed them upon their course until they moored at a holm hard
by the mainland. Here they landed and found the place abounding
in blooms and trees and streams, and the Prince left the ship to
reconnoitre the continent when suddenly a dust cloud drew nigh
and a sand-pillar soared awhile in air high; then it uncovered
some fifty horsemen, and they were pursuing in the hottest of
haste,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7642" id="noteref-7642" epub:type="noteref">7642</a> a stallion which was saddled and bridled and which they
intended to secure. Now for ten days they had galloped after
him but none availed to catch him. When the King’s son looked
upon that case he uttered a loud cry and the courser, hearing the
sound of his master’s voice, made for him and fell to rubbing his
cheeks upon his back and shoulders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7643" id="noteref-7643" epub:type="noteref">7643</a> until they came up with him
as he was standing beside his lord. Hereat all the riders dismounted
with intent to seize him, but the Prince opposed them
saying, “This is my horse and he was lost from me in such a place
upon the margin of the main.” Replied they, “’Tis well, but this
is our booty nor will we ever leave him to thee, for that during the
last ten days we have galloped after him until we are melted, and
our horses are melted as well as ourselves. Moreover, our King
awaiteth us and if we return without the steed our heads will be
cut off.” Quoth the Prince, “Nor ye nor that Sovran of yours can
have any command over him, albeit you may have pursued him at
speed for ten days or fifteen days or twenty days; nor shall you
make him a quarry or for yourselves or for the King of you. By
Allah, one Sultan was unable to take even a hair from him and,
by the Almighty! were you to pursue him for a full-told year not
one of you could come up with him or make him your own.”
Hereupon talk increased between them and one drew weapon
upon other and there befel between them contest and enmity and
rage of bad blood and each clapt hand to sword and drew it from
sheath. When the King’s son saw this from them, he sprang upon
the steed’s back swiftlier than the blinding leven; and, having
settled himself firmly in selle, he put forth his hand and seized a
sword which hung by the saddle bow. As soon as the folk saw
that he had mounted the horse, they charged upon him with their
scymitars and would have cut him down, but he made his steed
curvet and withdrew from them saying, “An you design battle I
am not fain of fight, and do ye all go about your business and
covet not the horse lest your greed deceive you and you ask more
than enough and thereby fall into harm. This much we know
and if you require aught else let the strongest and doughtiest of
you do his best.” Then they charged upon him a second time
and a third time and he warded them off and cried, “Allah draw
the line between me and you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7644" id="noteref-7644" epub:type="noteref">7644</a> O folk, and do ye gang your gait
for you be fifty riders and I be alone and singlehanded and how
shall one contend in fight with half an hundred?” Cried they,
“Naught shall save thee from us except thou dismount from the
steed and suffer us to take him and return home with him;”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the fifty
horsemen said to the King’s son, “There is no help but that we
take from thee the horse,” and said he, “I have given you good
advice, and well I wot and am certified that were you two hundred
riders ye could never prevail over me whilst I am mounted on my
courser’s back and indeed I have no fear of fight; but let any of
you who hath claim to knightlihood come forwards and take him
and mount him.” So saying he alighted forthright and left his
horse and went to some distance from him, when one of the
fifty riders pushed forwards and designed to seize the steed by
the reins and bestride him, when suddenly the stallion raged like
fire at him and attacked him and smote him with his forehand and
drove the entrails out of his belly and the man at once fell to the
ground slain. As his party saw this they bared their brands and
assaulted the horse designing to cut him in pieces when behold, a
dust-cloud high in lift upflew and walled the view; and all extended
their glances in that direction for an hour of time until it opened
and showed some two hundred knights headed by a King mighty
of degree and majesty and over his head were flags a-flying. The
fifty horsemen, seeing him advance with his troops, drew off and
stood still to look and see whom he might be, and when the
horse sighted these banners he sniffed with nostrils opened wide to
the air, and made for them at full speed, as if gladdened by the
sight, and approached them and returned to them a second time
in like guise and at the third time he drew up hard beside them and
nearing the King fell to rubbing his cheeks upon the stirrups whilst
the ruler put forth his hand and gentled the steed by smoothing
his head and forehead. As soon as the fifty riders saw this, they
marvelled thereat, but the King’s son who had kept his ground
was astounded and said to himself, “The horse fled me and when
this host drew nigh he sought me again.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7645" id="noteref-7645" epub:type="noteref">7645</a> Presently the Prince
fixed his glance upon the latest comers and behold, the King was
his father, so he sprang to him and when the sire saw him he
knew his son and footed it and the twain embraced and fell fainting
to the ground for awhile. When they recovered the suite of
the Sultan came forward and salam’d to the Prince who presently
asked his sire, “What may be the cause of thy coming to this
plain?” and the ruler informed him by way of answer that after
his child’s departure slumber to him brought no rest nor was
there in food aught of zest and with him longing overflowed for
the sake of his son, so that after a while of time he and the
grandees of his realm had marched forth, and he ended by saying,
“O my son, our leaving home was for the sake of thee, but do thou
tell me what befel thee after mounting the Father of a Pigeon, and
what was the cause of thy coming to this spot.” Accordingly the
Prince told all that had betided him, first and last, of his durance
vile amongst the Jews and how he had devised the killing of the
Captain and the capture of the craft; and how the steed, after being
lost in the waste,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7646" id="noteref-7646" epub:type="noteref">7646</a> had returned to him in this place; also of the
fifty riders who encountered him on landing and would fain have
seized him but failed and of the death of the horseman who was
slain by the horse. Hereat they pitched the pavilions upon that
spot and set up a throne for the King who after taking seat thereon
placed his son by his side and bade summon the fifty riders who
were brought into the presence——And Shahrazad was surprised

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting, and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Sultan took seat upon the throne and set his son by his side he
summoned the fifty riders, who were brought into the presence
and placed between his hands. Then he questioned them of their
case and their country and the cause of their coming to that stead
and they notified to him their native land and their Sovran and
the reason of their wandering; to wit, their headlong pursuit of
the stallion which had lasted for a term of ten days. Now when
the Sultan understood their words and knew and was certified
concerning their King and their country, he robed them with
honourable robes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7647" id="noteref-7647" epub:type="noteref">7647</a> and said to them, “Walláhi! had I known that
the stallion would have submitted to you and would have obeyed
you I should have delivered him up to you, but I feared for any
that durst approach him, barring his master. Now, however, do ye
depart and salam to your Sovran and say him:—By Allah, if the
stallion thou sawest wandering the waste befitted the use of thee
I had sent him in free gift.” With this fair message the men
farewelled him and fared from him and they ceased not faring until
they returned to their liege lord and reported to him all that had
betided them; that is, how the owner of the stallion had appeared
and proved to be a King who (they added) “hath sent his salam
to thee saying it was his desire to despatch the horse but none
availed to manage him save himself and his son.” And when the
Ruler heard these words, he returned thanks to the Sovran for the
grace of his goodness, and returned forthright to his own land.
Meanwhile the Sultan who was owner of the stallion presented the
captured ship to those who had captured her, and taking his son
turned towards his capital, and they marched without stay or
delay until they reached it. Hereupon the Chamberlains and the
Nabobs and the high Officers and the townsfolk came forth to
meet and greet their Ruler and rejoiced in his safety and that of
his son, and they adorned the city for three days and all were in
high mirth and merriment until what time the Sultan had settled
down at home. Such was his case; but as regards the Khwajah
and his daughter, when they had let load their loads they quitted
the cavern and set forth, making for their country and patrial
stead, and they ceased not forcing their marches for a term of ten
days. But on the eleventh they encountered fiery heat beginning
from mid-forenoon; and, as the place was grassy ground and overgrown
with greenery, they alighted from their beasts and bade pitch
two pavilions, one for the daughter and the other for her father and
his folk, that it might shade them and shelter them from the excessive
sultriness. Now when it was mid-afternoon behold, the damsel
was seized with the birth-pains and the pangs of child-bearing, but
Allah Almighty made delivery right easy to her and presently she
became the mother of a man-child—Glory be to God who
fashioned him and perfected what He had fashioned in the
creation of that babe!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7648" id="noteref-7648" epub:type="noteref">7648</a> So his mother cut his navel-string and,
rolling it up in one of her shifts, kept careful guard over it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7649" id="noteref-7649" epub:type="noteref">7649</a> And
presently her father entered to look upon her, and finding that she
had been delivered was grieved with exceeding grief and the
world was straitened before his face, and unknowing what to do
he said to himself, “Had we reached our homes and that babe
appeared with the damsel, our honour had been smirched and men
had blamed us saying:—The Khwajah’s daughter hath brought
forth in sin. So we cannot confront the world, and if we bear
with us this infant they will ask where is its father?” He
remained perplext and distraught, seeing no way of action, and
now he would say, “Let us slay the child,” and anon, “Let us
hide it;” and the while he was in that place his nature bespake
him with such promptings. But when morning came he had
determined upon abandoning the new-born and not carrying it
further, so quoth he to his daughter, “Hearken unto whatso I shall
say thee.” Quoth she, “’Tis well!” and he continued, “If we
travel with this infant the tidings of us will spread through the
city and men will say, The Khwajah’s daughter hath been
debauched and hath borne a babe in bastardy; and our right way
(according to me) is that we leave it in this tent under charge of the
Lord and whoso shall come up to the little one shall take it with
the tent; moreover I will place under its head two hundred dinars
and any whose lot it is shall carry off the whole.” When the
damsel heard these words she found the matter grievous, but she
could return no reply. “What sayest thou?” asked he, and she
answered, “Whatso is right that do thou.” Hereupon he took a
purse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7650" id="noteref-7650" epub:type="noteref">7650</a> of two hundred gold pieces which he set under the child’s
head and left it in the tent. Then he loaded his loads and fared
forth, he and his daughter and his pages, and they ceased not
pushing their marches until they reached their own land and native
country and entered their home, where they were met by sundry
of their familiars coming forth to greet them. They settled down
in their quarters when the damsel forgathered with her mother
who threw her arms round her neck for exceeding affection to her
and asked her of her news; so she informed her concerning the
matter of the cavern and what was therein and how great was its
distance, but she told her naught of what had befallen her nor of
her pregnancy by the Prince nor of the babe she had abandoned.
The mother still supposed that she was a clean maid, yet she
noted the change in her state and complexion. Then the damsel
sought privacy in one of the chambers and wept until her gallbladder
was like to burst and said to herself, “Would Heaven I
knew whether Allah will re-unite me with the child and its father
the Prince!” and in this condition she remained for a while of
time. On such wise it befel the Merchant and his daughter; but
as regards the son of the Sultan, when he had settled down in the
city of his sire he remembered the Khwajah’s daughter, and quoth
he to his father, “O my papa, my desire is to hunting and birding
and diversion.” Quoth the King, the better that Destiny might
be fulfilled, “’Tis well, O my son, but take with thee a suite.”
“I desire no more than five men in all,” said the other, and gat
himself ready for travel and, having farewelled his father, set forth
from the city——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince went forth
from his father with a train of five attendants and made for the
wilderness, and he conjoined the journeys of night and day;
withal he knew not whither he was going, and he chanced travel
over the same wilds and wolds and dales and stony leas. But as
regards the Merchant and his daughter, he went in to her one day of
the days and found her weeping and wailing, so he said to her,
“What causeth thee to shed tears, O my child?” and said she,
“How shall I not weep? indeed I must wail over my lot, and over the
promise wherewith Allah promised me.” Hereupon he exclaimed,
“O my daughter, be silent and Inshallah—God willing—I will
equip me for travel and will fare to the son of the King; and look
to it, for haply Allah Almighty our Lord may direct me to a
somewhat shall conduct me to the Prince’s city.” So saying he bade
his handmaidens and eunuchs make ready forthright a viaticum
sufficing for a full-told year himself and his following of pages
and eunuchs, and they did his bidding. After a few days they
prepared all he had required and he purposed to set out; then, he
loaded his loads and, farewelling his wife and daughter, went forth
seeking the city of the King’s son. He ceased not travelling for
a space of three months, when he found a meadow wide of sides
on the margin of a sweet-water lake, so he said to his slaves,
“Alight we here in this very place that we may take our rest.”
Accordingly, they dismounted and pitched a tent and furnisht
it for him, and he passed that night by the water-side, and all
enjoyed their repose. But as soon as morn ’gan show and shone
with sheeny glow, and the sun arose o’er the lands lying low, the
Khwajah designed to order a march for his slaves when suddenly
espying a dust-cloud towering in rear of them, they waited to see
what it might be, and after some two hours of the day it cleared
off and disclosed beneath it six riders and with them a bât-beast
carrying a load of provisions. These drew near the meadow where
the Khwajah sat looking at them, and fear hereat entered into his
heart, and trembling fell upon his limbs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7651" id="noteref-7651" epub:type="noteref">7651</a> until he was assured that
they were but six men. So his mind was calmed. But when the
party drew near him he fixed his glance and made certain that the
men were headed by the King’s son whom he had met on his first
journey, and he marvelled indeed at the youth making for the
same place, and he strove to guess the cause of his coming with
only five followers and no more. Then he arose and accosted him
and salam’d and sat down in converse with him, being assured the
while that it was the same who had had doings with his daughter,
and that the child which she had borne in the tent and which they
abandoned was the son of this Prince, while the youth knew not
that the Khwajah was father to the damsel with whom he had
tarried in the cavern. So they fell to communing together for a
while until the Prince asked the Trader, “What is the cause of thy
coming hither?” and answered the other, “I have come seeking
thee and thy country, for I have a want which thou must fulfil
me;” presently adding, “And thou, whither art thou intending?”
Quoth the King’s son, “I am making for the cavern wherein the
handmaidens showed me much honour, for indeed I gave my word
that I would return to them after I had revisited my country and
had met my folk and my friends; and here I am coming back
to keep what plight and promise were between us.” Hereupon
the Merchant arose, and taking the Prince, retired with him to a
place of privacy where none could wot of them twain save Allah
Almighty. “Would Heaven I knew what may be in the thoughts of
this Khwájah!” said the Prince in his mind; but when both had
seated themselves at ease, the Merchant addressed the King’s son
in these words, “O my son, all things are foredoomed in the World
of Secrets, and from fated lot is no flight. Now the end and aim
whereto thou designest in the cavern, verily they<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7652" id="noteref-7652" epub:type="noteref">7652</a> left it for their
own land.” When the King’s son heard these words informing
him that his beloved had quitted her abode, he cried out with a
loud outcry for stress of what had betided him, and fell a-swoon
by cause that love of the damsel had mastered his heart and his
vitals hung to her. After a while he recovered and asked the
Khwajah, “Say me, be these words of thine soothfast or false?”
“Soothfast indeed,” answered the father, “but, O my child, be of
good cheer and eyes clear, for that thy wish is won”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
goodwill? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director, the
right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the Khwajah
to the King’s son after he had revived, “O my child, be of good
cheer and eyes clear for that thy want is won and for thee the way
hath been short done and if thy heart be firm-fixed upon thy
beloved the heart of her is still firmer than thine and I am a
messenger from her who seek thee that I may unite you twain
Inshallah—an Allah please.” Asked the Prince, “And who
mayest thou be to her, O my lord?” and answered the other
“I am her father and she is my daughter and hers is a marvel-tale,
I swear by the All-might of Him who made the Heavens and the
Earth.” Then he fell to recounting anent the Voice which came
to him on the night of her being conceived in her mother’s womb
and all that had since befallen her, keeping concealed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7653" id="noteref-7653" epub:type="noteref">7653</a> only the
matter of the babe which she had borne in the tent. But when
the Prince knew that the wayfarer was her sire who was travelling
to seek him, he rejoiced in the glad tidings of forgathering with the
damsel and on the morning of the second day all marched off
together and made for the Merchant’s city. And they stinted not
wayfaring and forcing their marches until they drew near it, and as
soon as they entered it, the Merchant, before going to his home,
led the Prince with him and sought the Kazi by whose aid the
marriage-tie, after due settlement of the dowry, might be tied
between him and the damsel. This done, he conducted him to a
place of concealment and presently went in to his daughter and her
mother who saluted him and asked him the news. Hereupon he
gave them to know that he had brought the King’s son and had
made ready to knot the knot of wedlock between him and her.
As soon as the damsel heard these tidings she fainted for excess of
her happiness, and when she revived her mother arose and prepared
her person and adorned her and made her don her most sumptuous
of dresses. And when night fell they led the bridegroom in
procession to her and the couple embraced and each threw arms
round the neck of other for exceeding desire and their embraces
lasted till dawn-tide.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7654" id="noteref-7654" epub:type="noteref">7654</a> After that the times waxed clear to them
and the days were serene until one chance night of the nights when
the Prince was sitting beside his bride and conversing with her
concerning various matters when suddenly she fell to weeping and
wailing. He was consterned thereat and cried, “What causeth
thee cry, O dearling of my heart and light of mine eyes?” and
she, “How shall I not cry when they have parted me from my
boy, the life-blood of my liver!” “And thou, hast thou a babe?”
asked he and she answered, “Yes indeed, my child and thy child,
whom I conceived by thee while we abode in the cavern. But
when my father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7655" id="noteref-7655" epub:type="noteref">7655</a> took me therefrom and was leading me home
we encountered about midway a burning heat, so we halted and
pitched two tents for myself and my sire; then, as I sat within
mine the labour-pangs came upon me and I bare a babe as the
moon. But my parent feared to carry it with us lest our honour be
smirched by tittle-tattle, so we left the little one in the tent with
two hundred gold pieces under its head, that whoso might come
upon it and take it and tend it might therewith be repaid.” In
fine, she told her spouse the whole tale concerning her infant
and declared that she had no longer patience to be parted from
it. Her bridegroom consoled her and promised her with the
fairest promises that he would certainly set out and travel and
make search for the lost one amongst the lands, even though his
absence might endure through a whole year in the wilderness.
And lastly he said to her, “We will ask news and seek tidings of
him from all the wayfarers who wend by that same valley, and
certify ourselves of the information, nor will we return to thee save
with assured knowledge; for this child is the fruit of my loins and
I will never neglect him; no, never. Needs must I set forth and
fare to those parts and search for my son.” Such was their case;
but as regards the babe which had been abandoned (as we have
noticed), he lay alone for the first day and yet another when a
caravan appeared passing along that same road; and, as soon as they
sighted the pavilion yet they saw none within, they drew near to
it and behold, they found a babe lying prostrate with his fingers
in his mouth and sucking thereat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7656" id="noteref-7656" epub:type="noteref">7656</a> and he was even as a slice of
the moon. So they approached him and took him up and found
under his head the purse, whereupon they carried him, not forgetting
the gold, and showed him to the Shaykh of the Cafilah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7657" id="noteref-7657" epub:type="noteref">7657</a> who
cried, “Walláhi, our way is a blessed for that we have discovered
this child; and, inasmuch as I have no offspring, I will take him
and tend him and adopt him to son.” Now this caravan was from
the land of Al-Yaman and they had halted on that spot for a
night’s rest, so when it was morning they loaded and left it and
fared forwards and they ceased not wayfaring until they reached
their homes safe and sound. After returning all the Cafilah folk
dispersed, each to his own stead, but the Shaykh, who was employed
by government under the King of Al-Yaman, repaired to
his own house accompanied by the child which he had carefully
tended and salam’d to his wife. As soon as she saw the babe she
marvelled at his fashion and, sending for a wet-nurse, committed
him for suckling to her and set apart for her a place; and the
woman fell to tending him and cleaning him, and the house
prospered for the master and dame had charge of it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7658" id="noteref-7658" epub:type="noteref">7658</a> during the days
of suckling. And when the boy was weaned they fed him fairly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7659" id="noteref-7659" epub:type="noteref">7659</a>
and took sedulous charge of him, so he became accustomed to
bespeak the man with, “O my papa,” and the woman with, “O
my mamma,” believing the twain to be truly his parents. This
endured for some seven years when they brought him a Divine
to teach him at home, fearing lest he should fare forth the house;
nor would they at any time send him to school. So the tutor<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7660" id="noteref-7660" epub:type="noteref">7660</a>
took him in hand and taught him polite letters and he became a
reader and a writer and well versed in all knowledge before he
reached his tenth year. Then his adopted father appointed for
him a horse that he might learn cavalarice and the shooting of
shafts and firing of bullets at the butt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7661" id="noteref-7661" epub:type="noteref">7661</a> and then brought for him a
complete rider that he might teach him all his art and when he
came to the age of fourteen he became a doughty knight and a
prow. Now one chance day of the days the youth purposed
going to the wild that he might hunt,——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth proposed going
forth to the wild that he might hunt, but his guardians feared for
him so that he availed not to fare forth. Grievous to him was it
that he could not obtain his liberty to set out a-chasing, and there
befel him much concern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7662" id="noteref-7662" epub:type="noteref">7662</a> and a burning thirst; so he lay him
down sore sick and troubled. Hereupon his father and mother
went in to him and, finding that he had taken to his pillow, they
mourned over him, and fearing lest he be afflicted by some disease
they asked him, “What is to do with thee and what calamity hath
befallen thee?” Answered he, “There is no help but that I go
forth a-hunting in the wilderness.” Quoth they, “O our son, we
fear for thee,” and quoth he, “Fear not, for that all things be foredoomed
from Eternity and, if aught be written for me, ’twill come
to pass even although I were beside you; and the bye-word saith:—Profiteth
not Prudence against Predestination.” Hereat they
gave him permission, and upon the second day he rode forth to
the chase, but the wold and the wilds swallowed him up, and
when he would have returned he knew not the road, so he said to
himself, “Folk declare that affects are affected and footsteps are
sped to a life that is vile and divided daily bread.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7663" id="noteref-7663" epub:type="noteref">7663</a> If aught be
written to me fain must I fulfil it.” And whenever he hunted
down a gazelle, he cut its throat and broiled the meat over a fire
and nourished himself for a while of days and nights; but he was
lost in those wastes until he drew in sight of a city. This he
entered, but he had no money for food or for foraging his horse,
so he sold it willy nilly and, hiring a room in a Wakálah, lived by
expending its price till the money was spent. Then he cried,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great! The wise man doth even as the fool, but
All-might is to Allah.” So he went forth to solace himself in the
highways of the city, looking rightwards and leftwards, until he came
to the gateway of the King’s Palace, and when he glanced around
he saw written over it, “Dive not into the depths unless thou greed
for thyself and thy wants.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7664" id="noteref-7664" epub:type="noteref">7664</a> So he said in his mind, “What is
the meaning of these words I see here inscribed?” Presently he
repaired for aid to a man in a shop and salam’d to him, and when
his salutation was returned enquired of him, “O my lord, what is
the meaning of this writ which is written over the Sultan’s gateway?”
The other replied, “O my son, whereof dost thou ask?
Verily the Sultan and all the Lords of his land are in sore cark
and care for the affair of his daughter the Princess.” The youth
rejoined, “What is the matter with her and what hath befallen
her?” and the man retorted, “O my son, verily the Sultan hath a
daughter so fair that she seemeth cast in the very mould of beauty
and none in her day can excel her, but whoso is betrothed to her
and marrieth her and goeth in unto her the dawn never cometh
without his becoming a heap of poison, and no one wotteth
the business what it may be.” Hearing these words the youth
said to himself, “By Allah, the death of me were better than
this the life of me, but I have no dower to offer her.” Then he
asked the man, “O my uncle, whoso lacketh money and wisheth
to marry her, how shall he act?” “O my son,” answered the
other, “verily the Sultan demandeth nothing; nay, he expendeth
of his own wealth upon her.” The youth arose from beside the
man at that moment and, going in to the King, found him seated
on his throne; so he salam’d to him and prayed for him and
deprecated and kissed ground before him, and when the King
returned his salutation and welcomed him he cried, “O King of
the Age, ’tis my intent and design to be connected with thee
through the lady safe-guarded, thy daughter.” “By Allah, O
Youth,” said the Sultan, “I consent not for thine own sake that
thou wed her by cause that thou wilt be going wilfully to thy
death;” and hereupon he related to him all that befel each and
every who had married her and had gone in unto her. Quoth the
youth, “O King of the Age, indeed I rely upon the Lord, and if
I die I shall fare to Allah and His ruth and, if I live, ’tis well,
for that all things are from the Almighty.” Quoth the Sultan,
“O Youth, counsel appertaineth to Allah, for thou art her equal
in beauty;” and the other rejoined, “All things are by Fate and
man’s lot.” Hereupon the King summoned the Kazi and bade
tie the marriage-tie between the youth and his daughter; then he
went in to his Harem and apprised thereof her mother that she
might prepare the girl’s person for the coming night. But the
youth departed from the Sultan’s presence perplext of heart and
distraught, unknowing what to do; and, as he walked about,
suddenly he met a man in years, clean of raiment and with signs
of probity evident; so he accosted him and said, “O my lord, ask
a blessing for me.” Said the Shaykh, “O my son, may our Lord
suffice thee against all would work thee woe and may He ever
forefend thee from thy foe.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7665" id="noteref-7665" epub:type="noteref">7665</a> And the youth was gladdened by
the good omen of the Shaykh’s words. But when the Sultan had
sought his Harem he said, “By Allah, he who hath wedded the
damsel is a beautiful youth: oh the pity of it that he should die!
Indeed I dissuaded him, saying so-and-so shall befal thee, but
I could not deter him. Now by the rights of Him who raised the
firmament without basement, an  our Lord deign preserve this
Youth and he see the morn in safety, I will assuredly gift him and
share with him all my good, for that I have no male issue to
succeed me in the sovranty; and this one, if Allah Almighty
vouchsafe prolong his days, shall become my heir apparent and
inherit after me. Indeed I deem him to be a son of the Kings
who disguiseth himself, or some Youth of high degree who is
troubled about worldly goods and who sayeth in himself:—I will
take this damsel to wife that I may not die of want, for verily
I am ruined. I diverted him from wedding her, but it could not
be, and the more I deterred him with words manifold only the
more grew his desire and he cried:—I am content; thus speaking
after the fashion of one who longeth to perish. However, let him
meet his lot—either death-doom or deliverance from evil.” Now
when it was eventide the Sultan sent to summon his son-in-law
and, seating him beside the throne, fell to talking with him and
asking after his case; but he concealed his condition and said,
“Thy servant is such whereof ’tis spoken:—I fell from Heaven
and was received by Earth. Ask me not, O King of the Age, or
of the root or of the branch, for one of the wise and ware hath
said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To tell my root and my name refrain; ✿ The root of the youth is what good he gain:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7666" id="noteref-7666" epub:type="noteref">7666</a></div>
      <div class="line">A wight without father full oft shall win ✿ And melting shall purify drossy strain.”</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>And folk are equal but in different degrees.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7667" id="noteref-7667" epub:type="noteref">7667</a> Now when the Sultan
heard these words, he wondered at his eloquence and sweetness of
speech; withal he marvelled that his son-in-law would not explain to
him from what land or from what folk he came. And the two ceased
not their converse until after the hour of night prayers, when the
Lords of the land had been dismissed; whereupon the Sultan bade
an eunuch take the youth and introduce him to the Princess. So he
arose from him and went with the slave, the King exclaiming the
while, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great: verily yonder young man wendeth wilfully
to his death.” Now when the bridegroom reached the apartment
of the Sultan’s daughter and entered to her——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth, when
entering to the Sultan’s daughter, exclaimed “Bismillah—in the
name of Allah—I place my trust upon Allah, and I have committed
mine affair unto Allah!” Then he went forwards and
found his bride seated upon her bedstead, and she was as a Hoard
newly loosed from its Talisman; while she on her part rose and
met him, and looked upon him and considered him until she was
certified of his being cast in beauty’s mould, nor had she ever seen
any like unto him. So she wept till the tears trickled adown her
cheeks and she said to herself, “Oh the pity of it! Never shall
my joy be fulfilled with this beautiful youth, than whom mine eyes
never fell upon one fairer.” Quoth he, “What causeth thee cry,
O my lady?” and quoth she, “I cry for the loss of my joys with
thee seeing that thou art to perish this very night; and I sue of
the Almighty and supplicate Him that my life may be thy ransom,
for by Allah ’tis a pity!” When he heard these words he presently
looked around and suddenly he sighted a magical Sword<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7668" id="noteref-7668" epub:type="noteref">7668</a> hanging by
the belt against the wall: so he arose and hent it and threw it across
his shoulders; then, returning he took seat upon the couch beside
the Sultan’s daughter, withal his heart and his tongue never
neglected to recite the Names of Allah or to sue aidance from
the Prince of the Hallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7669" id="noteref-7669" epub:type="noteref">7669</a> who alone can reconcile with the
Almighty fiat the fates and affairs of God’s servants. This lasted
for an hour until the first third of the night, when suddenly were
heard the bellowings as of wind and rumblings of thunder, and the
bride, perceiving all the portents which had occurred to others,
increased in weeping and wailing. Then lo and behold! a wall
amiddlemost the chamber clave asunder, and there issued forth the
cleft a Basilisk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7670" id="noteref-7670" epub:type="noteref">7670</a> resembling a log of palm-tree, and he was blowing
like the storm-blast and his eyes were as cressets and he came on
wriggling and waving. But when the youth saw the monster he
sprang up forthright with stout heart that knew naught of startling
or affright, and cried out, “Protect me, O Chief and Lode-star of
the Hallows, for I have thrown myself upon thine honour and am
under thy safe-guard.” So saying and setting hand on brand he
advanced and confronted the portent swiftlier than an eye-glance,
raising his elbow till the blackness of the armpit appeared; and
he cried out with a loud outcry whereto the whole city re-echoed,
and which was audible even to the Sultan. Then he smote the
monster upon his neck<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7671" id="noteref-7671" epub:type="noteref">7671</a> and caused head to fly from body for a
measure of some two spans. Hereupon the Basilisk fell dead, but
the youth was seized by a fainting-fit for the mighty stress of his
stroke, and the bride arose for the excess of her joy and threw
herself upon him and swooned away for a full-told hour. When
the couple recovered, the Princess fell to kissing his hands and feet
and wiping with her kerchief the sweat from his brow and saying
to him, “O my lord, and light of mine eyes, may none thy hand
ever foreslow nor exult over thee any foe,” till he had recovered
his right senses and had regained his strength. Anon he arose,
and taking the Basilisk set it upon a large tray;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7672" id="noteref-7672" epub:type="noteref">7672</a> then, letting
bring a skinful of water he cleaned away the blood. After this
the youth and the King’s daughter sat down and gave each other
joy of their safety and straightway disappeared from them all traces
of distress. Presently the Bridegroom looked at his Bride and found
her like a pearl, so he caused her to laugh and disported with her and
excited her and she did on like wise and at last he threw her upon her
back and did away her maidenhead, whenas their gladness grew
and their pleasures were perfected and their joyance was enhanced
by the monster’s death. They ceased not, the twain of them
toying and enjoying themselves until it was well nigh dawn and
sleep overcame them and they slumbered. But the Sultan during
that night could relish nor lying down nor sitting up, and as soon
as he heard the shout he cried, “The Youth is indeed dead and
this world hath fled! There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.” About morning-tide he
prepared for him a shroud and mortuary perfumes, and all things
required, and despatched a party to dig a tomb for him who had
been slain by the side of his daughter, and he let make an iron
bier, after which he sent for the washers of the dead and summoned
them to his presence and lastly he awaited for his wife to seek her
daughter and bring him the tidings——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sat until morning-tide expecting his wife to bring him tidings of
the youth that he might take him and bury him. But the Queenmother
repaired to her daughter’s apartment where she found the
door locked and bolted upon the couple; so she knocked for them
whilst her eyes were tear-stained and she was wailing over the
loss of her daughter’s love-liesse. Hereat the Princess awoke
and she arose and opened the door when behold, she found her
mother weeping so she asked her, “What caused thee shed tears,
O Mother mine, whilst my enjoyment hath been the completest?”
Asked she, “And what hath joyed you?” So the daughter led
her to the middlemost of the apartment where she found the
Basilisk (which was like the section of a palm-trunk) lying dead
upon a huge tray and she saw her son-in-law sleeping upon the
bedstead<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7673" id="noteref-7673" epub:type="noteref">7673</a> and he was like a fragment of the moon on the
fourteenth night. The mother bowed head towards him and
kissed him upon the brow saying, “Verily and indeed thou
deservest safety!” Then she went forth from him lullilooing
aloud and bade all the handmaids raise the cry of joy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7674" id="noteref-7674" epub:type="noteref">7674</a> and the
Palace was turned topsy-turvy with gladness and delight. When
the Sultan heard this he arose and asked “What may be the
news? Are we in grief or in gladness;” and so saying he went
forth when suddenly he was met by his wife in the highest delight
who took him and led him to the apartment of her daughter.
There he also espied the Basilisk stretched dead upon the tray
and the youth his son-in-law lying asleep upon the bedstead,
whereat from the stress of his joyance he fell to the floor in a
fainting-fit which lasted an hour or so. But when he revived he
cried, “Is this wake or rather is’t sleep?” after which he arose
and bade the musicians of his band beat the kettledrums and
blow the shawms and the trumps and he commanded adorn the
city; and the citizens did all his bidding. The decorations
remained during seven days in honour of the safety of the
Sultan’s son-in-law, and increased were their joys and fell from
them all annoys, and the Sultan took to distributing and giving
alms and largessing and making presents to the Fakirs and the
miserable and he robed his nobles with honourable robes and
fed the captives and the prisoners one and all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7675" id="noteref-7675" epub:type="noteref">7675</a>; and the naked
he clothed, and those anhungered he feasted in honour of his
daughter. Then said the Sultan, “By Allah, this youth deserveth
naught save that I make him my partner and share with him my
good, for he hath banished from us our dule and our dolours and
eke on account of himself and his own sake.” After this he made
over to him half of his realm and his riches and the Sultan would
rule one day and his son-in-law the other and their joys endured
for the space of a full-told year. Then the Sovran was seized
of a sickness, so he bequeathed to his son-in-law all he had and
everything he owned; and but a little time elapsed before his
malady increased day by day until he fared to the ruth of
Almighty Allah and the youth sat in his stead as Sovran and
Sultan. Such was his case; but as regards the matter of his
sire, the King’s son of Al-’Irak, when he promised his wife that
he would certainly go forth and travel and search for their son,
he ceased not wending through the regions for a length of nights
and days until Destiny threw him into such-and-such a city; and
from the excess of what he had suffered of toil and travail he
tarried therein a time. Now the Shaykh of the Caravans (who had
found the babe in the tent and had taken him and had tended
and adopted him, and from whom the youth when grown to
man’s estate had disappeared on the hunting excursion and
returned not to his parents) also set out a-seeking him and fell
diligently to searching for tidings of him and roaming from place
to place. Presently he was cast by doom of Destiny into the
same city; and, as he found none to company with, he was
suddenly met on one of the highways by the youth’s true father
and the twain made acquaintance and became intimate until they
nighted and morning’d in the same stead; withal neither knew
what was his companion. But one night of the nights the two
sat down in talk and the true sire asked the adoptive father, “O
my brother, tell us the cause of thy going forth from thy country
and of thy coming hither?” Answered his comrade, “By Allah,
O my brother, my tale is a wondrous and mine adventure is a
marvellous.” Quoth he, “And how?” and quoth the other, “I
was Shaykh of the Cafilahs on various trading journeys, and
during one of them I passed by a way of the ways where I found
a pavilion pitched at a forking of the roads. So I made for it and
dismounted my party in that place and I glanced at the tent but
we found none therein, whereupon I went forwards and entered it
and saw a babe new-born strown upon his back and sucking his
fingers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7676" id="noteref-7676" epub:type="noteref">7676</a> So I raised him between my hands and came upon a
purse of two hundred dinars set under his head; and I took the
gold and carried it off together with the child.” But when his
comrade, the true father, heard this tale from him he said to
himself, “This matter must have been after such fashion,” and
he was certified that the foundling was his son, for that he had
heard the history told by the mother of the babe with the same
details essential and accidental. So he firmly believed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7677" id="noteref-7677" epub:type="noteref">7677</a> in these
words and rejoiced thereat, when his comrade continued, “And
after that, O my brother, I bore off that babe and having no
offspring I gave him to my wife who rejoiced therein and brought
him a wet-nurse to suckle him for the usual term. When he had
reached his sixth year I hired a Divine to read with him and teach
him writing and the art of penmanship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7678" id="noteref-7678" epub:type="noteref">7678</a>; and, as soon as he saw
ten years, I bought him a horse of the purest blood, whereon he
learnt cavalarice and the shooting of shafts and the firing of bullets
until he attained his fifteenth year. Presently one day of the days
he asked to go a-hunting in the wilderness, but we his parents (for
he still held me to be his father and my wife his mother) forbade
him in fear of accidents; whereupon he waxed sore sorrowful
and we allowed him leave to fare forth.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the adoptive
father pursued to his comrade, “So we permitted him to
hie a-hunting, and he farewelled us and went forth from us and
left us, whereat we fell to beweeping him; and inasmuch as until
this present he hath not returned to us, I have set out to seek
him and here am I in this place searching for traces of him.
Peradventure may Allah Almighty deign unite me with him and
gar me forgather with him; for, Walláhi! from the hour he
went from us sleep hath done us no good nor have we found
relish in food.” And when the speech was ended, quoth his
comrade, “O my brother, whenas he is not the son of thy loins
and he could prove himself perverse to thee, what must be the
condition in his regard of the father who begat him and the
mother who enwombed him?” He replied, “Theirs must be
cark and care and misery beyond even mine;” and the other
rejoined, “By Allah, O my brother, verily the relation thou hast
related anent this child proveth that he is, by God, my child and
of mine own seed, for in sooth his mother gave birth to him in that
stead where she left him being unable to carry him with her,
but now she beweepeth the loss of him through the nights and
the days.” “O my brother,” quoth the adoptive father, “we
twain, I and thou, will indeed make public search and open
inquiry for him through the lands, and Allah Almighty shall
guide us himwards.” When morning came the pair went forth
together intending to journey from that city, but by doom of the
Decreer the Sultan on that very day set out to visit the gardens;
and, when the travellers heard tidings thereof, one said to the
other, “Let us stay and solace ourselves with a sight of the royal
suite and after we will wend our ways.” Said his comrade, “’Tis
well.” So they took their station to await the issuing forth of the
Sultan, who suddenly rode out amid his suite as the two stood
leaning beside the road and looking at the Sultan, when behold,
his glance fell upon the two men. He at once recognised the
father who had reared him, and when he gazed at the other
standing beside him his heart was opened to the love of him
albeit he weeted naught of their tie of blood nor believed that
any was his sire save the Shaykh who had adopted him. Accordingly,
after considering them he bade carry them both to the House
of Hospitality, so they led them thither and did his bidding.
Hereupon the twain said to themselves, “Wherefore hath the
Sultan made us his guests? Nor he knoweth us nor we know
him and needs must this have a cause.” But after leaving them
the King rode to the gardens where he tarried the whole day,
and when it was sunset he returned to his Palace, and at supper-tide
commanded the men be brought before him. They salam’d
to him and blessed him and he returned their salutations, and
bade them take seat at the trays whereat none other was present.
They obeyed his order much wondering thereat the while and
musing in their minds, “What condition is this?” They ate till
they were satisfied, after which the food-trays were removed and
they washed their hands and drank coffee and sherbets; then,
by command of the King, they sat down to converse when the
Sultan addressed them instead of the others, whereat they marvelled
self-communing and saying, “What can be the cause?”
But as soon as all the attendants had been dismissed to their
quarters and no one remained save the Sultan and his guests
(three in all and no more), and it was the first third of the
night, the King asked them, “Which of you availeth to tell a tale
which shall be a joyance to our hearts?” The first to answer
him was the true father, who said:—Walláhi; O King of the Age,
there befel me an adventure which is one of the wonders of the
world, and ’tis this. I am son to a King of the Kings of the
earth who was wealthy of money and means, and who had the
goods of life beyond measure. He feared for my safety because
he had none other save myself, and one day of the days, when
I craved leave to go a-hunting in the wilderness, he refused me
in his anxiety for my safety. (Hereat, quoth the Sultan in himself,
“By Allah, the story of this man is like my history!”) So
quoth I:—O King, unless I fare forth to sport, verily I will slay
myself, and quoth my sire:—O my son, do thou go ride to the
chase, but leave us not long for the hearts of us two, I and thy
mother, will be engrossed by thee. Said I, “Hearing and obeying,”
and I went down to the stable to take a steed; and finding
a smaller stall wherein was a horse chained to four posts and, on
guard beside him two slaves who could never draw near him, I
approached him and fell to smoothing his coat. He remained
silent and still whilst I took his furniture and set it upon his
back, and girthed his saddle right tight and bridled him and
loosed him from the four posts, and during all this he never
started nor shied at me by reason of the Fate and Fortune writ
upon my forehead from the Secret World. Then I got him ready
and mounted him and went forth——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would
relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the man who
was bespeaking the Sultan pursued to him, “Then I mounted him
and rode him over the gravelly ground without the city when
behold, he snorted and snarked and shook his crest and started at
speed and galloped with me and bolted, swiftly as though he were
a bird in the firmament of heaven.” On this wise he fell to
recounting all that had befallen in the cave between him and the
Merchant’s daughter and what had betided him by decree of Allah;
how he had left her for his own land and how had her sire come
and carried her away; also in what manner she had been delivered
of a son by him on the road and had left her babe-child in the tent
hoping that someone might find him and take him and tend him;
and, lastly, how he had married the child’s mother and what was
the cause of his going forth and his coming to that place that he
might seek his son. Hereupon the Sultan turned to his adoptive
father whom hitherto he had believed to be his real parent saying,
“And thou, the other, dost thou know any tale like that told to us
by thy comrade?” So the Shaykh recounted to him the whole
history as hath before been set forth from incept to conclusion, nor
hid from him aught thereof. Then the Sultan declared himself to
his true sire, saying, “Thou art my father and there befel such
things and such,” after which said his adoptive parent, “Walláhi,
O my son, verily none is thy father save this one from whose loins
thou art sprung, for I only found thee in the pavilion and took
thee and tended thee in my home. But this is thy very parent in
very deed.” Hereat all the three fell upon one another’s necks
and kissed one another and the Sultan cried, “Praise to Him who
hath united us after disunion!” and the others related to him
anent his maternal grandfather how he was a Merchant, and
concerning his paternal grandsire how he was a Monarch. Anon
each of the two was ordered to revisit his own country and convey
his consort and his children; and the twain disappeared for the
space of a year and a month and at length returned to the young
King. Hereupon he set apart for them palaces and settled them
therein and they tarried with him until such time as there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies.</p>
