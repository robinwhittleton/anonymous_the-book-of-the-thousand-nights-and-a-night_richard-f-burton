<p>It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that in times of yore and
in years and ages long gone before, there lived in Damascus a
merchant among the merchants, a wealthy man who had a son like
the moon on the night of his fullness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-779" id="noteref-779" epub:type="noteref">779</a> and withal sweet of speech,
who was named Ghanim bin 'Ayyúb surnamed the Distraught, the
Thrall o' Love. He had also a daughter, own sister to Ghanim,
who was called Fitnah, a damsel unique in beauty and loveliness.
Their father died and left them abundant wealth,—And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Thirty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant
left his two children abundant wealth and amongst other things an
hundred loads<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-780" id="noteref-780" epub:type="noteref">780</a> of silks and brocades, musk-pods and mother
o' pearl; and there was written on every bale, "This is of the
packages intended for Baghdad," it having been his purpose to
make the journey thither, when Almighty Allah took him to
Himself, which was in the time of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.
After a while his son took the loads and, bidding farewell to his
mother and kindred and townsfolk, went forth with a company
of merchants, putting his trust in Allah Almighty, who decreed him
safety, so that he arrived without let or stay at Baghdad. There
he hired for himself a fair dwelling house which he furnished with
carpets and cushions, curtains and hangings; and therein stored
his bales and stabled his mules and camels, after which he abode
a while resting. Presently the merchants and notables of Baghdad
came and saluted him, after which he took a bundle containing
ten pieces of costly stuffs, with the prices written on them, and
carried it to the merchants' bazar, where they welcomed and
saluted him and showed him all honour; and, making him dismount
from his beast, seated him in the shop of the Syndic of the market,
to whom he delivered the package. He opened it and drawing out
the pieces of stuff, sold them for him at a profit of two dinars on
every dinar of prime cost. At this Ghanim rejoiced and kept
selling his silks and stuffs one after another, and ceased not to
do on this wise for a full year. On the first day of the following
year he went, as was his wont, to the Exchange which was
in the bazar, but found the gate shut; and enquiring the reason
was told, "One of the merchants is dead and all the others have
gone to follow his bier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-781" id="noteref-781" epub:type="noteref">781</a> and why shouldst thou not win the
meed of good deeds by walking with them?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-782" id="noteref-782" epub:type="noteref">782</a> He replied "Yes,"
and asked for the quarter where the funeral was taking place, and
one directed him thereto. So he purified himself by the Wuzu-ablution<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-783" id="noteref-783" epub:type="noteref">783</a>
and repaired with the other merchants to the oratory,
where they prayed over the dead, then walked before the bier to
the burial-place, and Ghanim, who was a bashful man, followed
them being ashamed to leave them. They presently issued from the
city, and passed through the tombs until they reached the grave
where they found that the deceased's kith and kin had pitched a
tent over the tomb and had brought thither lamps and wax-candles.
So they buried the body and sat down while the readers
read out and recited the Koran over the grave; and Ghanim sat
with them, being overcome with bashfulness and saying to himself
"I cannot well go away till they do." They tarried listening to
the Koranic perlection till nightfall, when the servants set supper
and sweetmeats<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-784" id="noteref-784" epub:type="noteref">784</a> before them and they ate till they were satisfied;
then they washed their hands and again took their places. But
Ghanim's mind was preoccupied with his house and goods, being
in fear of robbers, and he said to himself, "I am a stranger here and
supposed to have money: if I pass the night abroad the thieves
will steal my money-bags and my bales to boot." So when he
could no longer control his fear he arose and left the assembly,
having first asked leave to go about some urgent business; and
following the signs of the road he soon came to the city-gate. But
it was midnight and he found the doors locked and saw none going
or coming nor heard aught but the hounds baying and the wolves
howling. At this he exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah! I was in fear for my property and
came back on its account, but now I find the gate shut and
I am in mortal fear for my life!" Then he turned back and,
looking out for a place where he could sleep till morning, presently
found a Santon's tomb, a square of four walls with a date-tree
in the central court and a granite gateway. The door was
wide open; so he entered and would fain have slept, but sleep came
not to him; and terror and a sense of desolation oppressed him,
for that he was alone amidst the tombs. So he rose to his feet
and, opening the door, looked out and lo! he was ware of a light
afar off in the direction of the city-gate; then walking a little way
towards it, he saw that it was on the road whereby he had reached
the tomb. This made him fear for his life, so he hastily shut
the door and climbed to the top of the date-tree where he hid
himself in the heart of the fronds. The light came nearer and
nearer till it was close to the tomb; then it stopped and he saw
three slaves, two bearing a chest and one with a lanthorn, an adze
and a basket containing some mortar. When they reached the
tomb, one of those who were carrying the case said, "What aileth
thee O Sawab?"; and said the other, "What is the matter O
Kafur?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-785" id="noteref-785" epub:type="noteref">785</a> Quoth he, "Were we not here at supper-tide and did
we not leave the door open?" "Yes," replied the other, "that is
true." "See," said Kafur, "now it is shut and barred." "How
weak are your wits!" cried the third who bore the adze and his
name was Bukhayt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-786" id="noteref-786" epub:type="noteref">786</a> "know ye not that the owners of the gardens
use to come out from Baghdad and tend them and, when evening
closes upon them, they enter this place and shut the door, for fear
lest the wicked blackmen, like ourselves, should catch them and
roast 'em and eat 'em."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-787" id="noteref-787" epub:type="noteref">787</a> "Thou sayest sooth," said the two others,
"but by Allah, however that may be, none amongst us is weaker
of wits than thou." "If ye do not believe me," said Bukhayt, "let
us enter the tomb and I will rouse the rat for you; for I doubt
not but that, when he saw the light and us making for the place,
he ran up the date-tree and hid there for fear of us." When
Ghanim heard this, he said in himself, "O curstest of slaves! May
Allah not have thee in His holy keeping for this thy craft and
keenness of wit! There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! How shall I win free of these
blackamoors?" Then said the two who bore the box to him of
the adze, "Swarm up the wall and open the gate for us, O
Bukhayt, for we are tired of carrying the chest on our necks;
and when thou hast opened the gate thou shalt have one of those
we catch inside, a fine fat rat which we will fry for thee after such
excellent fashion that not a speck of his fat shall be lost." But
Bukhayt answered, "I am afraid of somewhat which my weak
wits have suggested to me: we should do better to throw the chest
over the gateway; for it is our treasure." "If we throw it 'twill
break," replied they; and he said, "I fear lest there be robbers
within who murder folk and plunder their goods, for evening is
their time of entering such places and dividing their spoil." "O
thou weak o' wits," said both the bearers of the box, "how could
they ever get in here!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-788" id="noteref-788" epub:type="noteref">788</a> Then they set down the chest and climbing
over the wall dropped inside and opened the gate, whilst the
third slave (he that was called Bukhayt) stood by them holding
the adze, the lanthorn and the hand-basket containing the mortar.
After this they locked the gate and sat down; and presently one of
them said, "O my brethren, we are wearied with walking and with
lifting up and setting down the chest, and with unlocking and
locking the gate; and now 'tis midnight, and we have no breath
left to open, a tomb and bury the box: so let us rest here two or
three hours, then rise and do the job. Meanwhile each of us shall
tell how he came to be castrated and all that befel him from first
to last, the better to pass away our time while we take our rest."
Thereupon the first, he of the lanthorn and whose name was
Bukhayt, said, "I'll tell you my tale." "Say on," replied they;
so he began as follows the</p>

<h3 class="c014"><em>TALE OF THE FIRST EUNUCH BUKHAYT.</em></h3>

<p class="c015">Know, O my brothers, that when I was a little one, some five
years old, I was taken home from my native country by a slave-driver
who sold me to a certain Apparitor.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-789" id="noteref-789" epub:type="noteref">789</a> My purchaser had a
daughter three years old, with whom I was brought up, and they
used to make mock of me, letting me play with her and dance for
her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-790" id="noteref-790" epub:type="noteref">790</a> and sing to her, till I reached the age of twelve and she that
of ten; and even then they did not forbid me seeing her. One day
I went in to her and found her sitting in an inner room, and she
looked as if she had just come out of the bath which was in the
house; for she was scented with essences and reek of aromatic
woods, and her face shone like the circle of the moon on the fourteenth
night. She began to sport with me, and I with her. Now
I had just reached the age of puberty; so my prickle stood at
point, as it were a huge key. Then she threw me on my back
and, mounting astraddle on my breast, fell a-wriggling and
a-bucking upon me till she had uncovered my yard. When she
saw it standing with head erect, she hent it in hand and began
rubbing it upon the lips of her little slit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-791" id="noteref-791" epub:type="noteref">791</a> outside her petticoat-trousers.
Thereat hot lust stirred in me and I threw my arms
round her, while she wound hers about my neck and hugged me to
her with all her might, till, before I knew what I did, my pizzle
split up her trousers and entered her slit and did away her maidenhead.
When I saw this, I ran off and took refuge with one of my
comrades. Presently her mother came in to her; and, seeing her
in this case, fainted clean away. However she managed the matter
advisedly and hid it from the girl's father out of good will to me;
nor did they cease to call to me and coax me, till they took me
from where I was. After two months had passed by, her mother
married her to a young man, a barber who used to shave her papa,
and portioned and fitted her out of her own monies; whilst the
father knew nothing of what had passed. On the night of consummation
they cut the throat of a pigeon-poult and sprinkled the
blood on her shift.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-792" id="noteref-792" epub:type="noteref">792</a> After a while they seized me unawares and
gelded me; and, when they brought her to her bridegroom, they
made me her Agha,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-793" id="noteref-793" epub:type="noteref">793</a> her eunuch, to walk before her wheresoever
she went, whether to the bath or to her father's house. I abode
with her a long time enjoying her beauty and loveliness by way of
kissing and clipping and coupling with her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-794" id="noteref-794" epub:type="noteref">794</a> till she died, and her
husband and mother and father died also; when they seized me
for the Royal Treasury as being the property of an intestate, and
I found my way hither, where I became your comrade. This,
then, O my brethren, is the cause of my cullions being cut off; and
peace be with you! He ceased and his fellow began in these
words the</p>

  <h3 class="c014"><em>TALE OF THE SECOND EUNUCH, KAFUR.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c015">Know, O my brothers that, when beginning service as a boy of
eight, I used to tell the slave-dealers regularly and exactly one lie
every year, so that they fell out with one another, till at last my
master lost patience with me and, carrying me down to the market,
ordered the brokers to cry, "Who will buy this slave, knowing his
blemish and making allowance for it?" He did so and they asked
him, "Pray, what may be his blemish?" and he answered, "He
telleth me one single lie every year." Now a man that was a
merchant came up and said to the broker, "How much do they
allow for him with his blemish?" "They allow six hundred
dirhams," he replied; and said the other, "Thou shalt have
twenty dirhams for thyself." So he arranged between him and
the slave-dealer who took the coin from him and the broker
carried me to the merchant's house and departed, after receiving
his brokerage. The trader clothed me with suitable dress, and
I stayed in his service the rest of my twelvemonth, until the new
year began happily. It was a blessed season, plenteous in the
produce of the earth, and the merchants used to feast every day
at the house of some one among them, till it was my master's turn
to entertain them in a flower-garden without the city. So he and
the other merchants went to the garden, taking with them all that
they required of provaunt and else beside, and sat eating and
carousing and drinking till mid-day, when my master, having need
of some matter from his home, said to me, "O slave, mount the
she-mule and hie thee to the house and bring from thy mistress
such and such a thing and return quickly." I obeyed his bidding
and started for the house but, as I drew near it, I began to cry out
and shed tears, whereupon all the people of the quarter collected,
great and small; and my master's wife and daughters, hearing the
noise I was making, opened the door and asked me what was the
matter. Said I, "My master was sitting with his friends beneath
an old wall, and it fell on one and all of them; and when I saw
what had happened to them, I mounted the mule and came hither
in haste to tell you." When my master's daughters and wife heard
this, they screamed and rent their raiment and beat their faces,
whilst the neighbours came around them. Then the wife overturned
the furniture of the house, one thing upon another, and tore
down the shelves and broke the windows and the lattices and
smeared the walls with mud and indigo, saying to me, "Woe to
thee, O Kafur! come help me to tear down these cupboards and
break up these vessels and this chinaware,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-795" id="noteref-795" epub:type="noteref">795</a> and the rest of it."
So I went to her and aided her to smash all the shelves in the
house with whatever stood upon them, after which I went round
about the terrace-roofs and every part of the place, spoiling all
I could and leaving no china in the house unbroken till I had laid
waste the whole, crying out the while "Well-away! my master!"
Then my mistress fared forth bare-faced wearing a head-kerchief
and naught else, and her daughters and the children sallied out
with her, and said to me, "O Kafur, go thou before us and show us
the place where thy master lieth dead, that we may take him from
under the fallen wall and lay him on a bier and bear him to the
house and give him a fine funeral." So I went forth before them
crying out, "Alack, my master!"; and they after me with faces
and heads bare and all shrieking, "Alas! Alas for the man!" Now
there remained none in the quarter, neither man nor woman, nor
epicene, nor youth nor maid, nor child nor old trot, but went
with us smiting their faces and weeping bitterly, and I led them
leisurely through the whole city. The folk asked them what was
the matter, whereupon they told them what they had heard from
me, and all exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah!" Then said one of them, "He was a personage of
consequence; so let us go to the Governor and tell him what hath
befallen him." When they told the Governor,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they
told the Governor, he rose and mounted and, taking with him
labourers, with spades and baskets, went on my track, with many
people behind him; and I ran on before them, howling and casting
dust on my head and beating my face, followed by my mistress and
her children keening for the dead. But I got ahead of them and
entered the garden before them, and when my master saw me in
this state, I smiting my face and saying, "Well-away! my mistress
Alas! Alas! Alas! who is left to take pity on me, now that my
mistress is gone? Would I had been a sacrifice for her!", he stood
aghast and his colour waxed yellow and he said to me, "What
aileth thee O Kafur! What <em>is</em> the matter?" "O my lord," I
replied, "when thou sentest me to the house, I found that the
saloon-wall had given way and had fallen like a layer upon my
mistress and her children!" "And did not thy mistress escape?"
"No, by Allah, O my master; not one of them was saved; the
first to die was my mistress, thine elder daughter!" "And did not
my younger daughter escape?"; "No, she did not!" "And what
became of the mare-mule I use to ride, is she safe?" "No, by
Allah, O my master, the house-walls and the stable-walls buried
every living thing that was within doors, even to the sheep and
geese and poultry, so that they all became a heap of flesh and the
dogs and cats are eating them and not one of them is left alive."
"And hath not thy master, my elder son, escaped?" "No, by Allah!
not one of them was saved, and now there is naught left of house
or household, nor even a sign of them: and, as for the sheep and
geese and hens, the cats and dogs have devoured them." When
my master heard this the light became night before his sight; his
wits were dazed and he so lost command of his senses that he could
not stand firm on his feet: he was as one struck with a sudden
palsy and his back was like to break. Then he rent his raiment
and plucked out his beard and, casting his turband from off his
head, buffetted his face till the blood ran down and he cried aloud,
"Alas, my children! Alas, my wife! Alas, my calamity! To whom
ever befel that which hath befallen me?" The merchants, his
friends, also cried aloud at his crying and wept for his weeping and
tore their clothes, being moved to pity of his case; and so my
master went out of the garden, smiting his face with such violence
that from excess of pain he staggered like one drunken with wine.
As he and the merchants came forth from the garden-gate, behold,
they saw a great cloud of dust and heard a loud noise of crying
and lamentation; so they looked and lo! it was the Governor
with his attendants and the townsfolk, a world of people, who had
come out to look on, and my master's family following them, all
screaming and crying aloud and weeping exceeding sore weeping.
The first to address my owner were his wife and children; and when
he saw them he was confounded and laughed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-797" id="noteref-797" epub:type="noteref">797</a> and said to them,
"How is it with all of you and what befel you in the house and
what hath come to pass to you?" When they saw him they
exclaimed, "Praise be to Allah for thy preservation!" and threw
themselves upon him and his children hung about him crying,
"Alack, our father! Thanks to Allah for thy safety, O our father!"
And his wife said to him, "Art thou indeed well? Laud to Allah
who hath shown us thy face in safety!" And indeed she was confounded
and her reason fled when she saw him, and she asked, "O,
my lord, how didst thou escape, thou and thy friends the merchants?";
and he answered her, "And how fared it with thee in
the house?" Quoth they, "We were all well, whole and healthy,
nor hath aught of evil befallen us in the house, save that thy slave
Kafur came to us, bareheaded with torn garments and howling:—Alas,
the master! Alas the master! So we asked him:—What
tidings, O Kafur? and he answered:—A wall of the garden hath
fallen on my master and his friends the merchants, and they are all
crushed and dead!" "By Allah," said my master, "he came to
me but now howling:—Alas, my mistress! Alas, the children of
the mistress!, and said:—My mistress and her children are all
dead, every one of them!" Then he looked round and seeing me
with my turband rent in rags round my neck, howling and weeping
with exceeding weeping and throwing dust upon my head, he cried
out at me. So I came to him and he said, "Woe to thee, O ill-omened
slave! O whoreson knave! O thou damned breed! What
mischief thou hast wrought? By Allah! I will flog thy skin from
thy flesh and cut thy flesh from thy bones!" I rejoined, "By
Allah, thou canst do nothing of the kind with me, O my lord, for
thou boughtest me with my blemish; and there are honest men to
bear witness against thee that thou didst so accepting the condition,
and that thou knewest of my fault which is to tell one lie
every year. Now this is only a half-lie, but by the end of the
year I will tell the other half, then will the lie stand whole and
complete." "O dog, son of a dog!", cried my master, "O most
accursed of slaves, is this all of it but a half-lie? Verily if it be
a half-lie 'tis a whole calamity! Get thee from me, thou art free in
the face of Allah!" "By Allah," rejoined I, "if thou free me, I
will not free thee till my year is completed and I have told thee the
half-lie which is left. When this is done, go down with me to the
slave-market and sell me as thou boughtest me to whoso will buy
me with my blemish; but thou shalt not manumit me, for I have
no handicraft whereby to gain my living;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-798" id="noteref-798" epub:type="noteref">798</a> and this my demand is
a matter of law which the doctors have laid down in the Chapter of
Emancipation."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-799" id="noteref-799" epub:type="noteref">799</a> While we were at these words, up came the crowd
of people, and the neighbours of the quarter, men, women and
children, together with the Governor and his suite offering condolence.
So my master and the other merchants went up to him
and informed him of the adventure, and how this was but a half-lie,
at which all wondered, deeming it a whole lie and a big one. And
they cursed me and reviled me, while I stood laughing and grinning
at them, till at last I asked, "How shall my master slay me when
he bought me with this my blemish?" Then my master returned
home and found his house in ruins, and it was I who had laid waste
the greater part of it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-800" id="noteref-800" epub:type="noteref">800</a> having broken things which were worth
much money, as also had done his wife, who said to him, "'Twas
Kafur who broke the vessels and chinaware." Thereupon his rage
redoubled and he struck hand upon hand exclaiming, "By Allah!
in my life never saw I a whoreson like this slave; and he saith this
is but a half-lie! How, then, if he had told me a whole lie? He
would ruin a city, aye or even two." Then in his fury he went to
the Governor, and they gave me a neat thing in the bastinado-line
and made me eat stick till I was lost to the world and a fainting-fit
came on me; and, whilst I was yet senseless, they brought the
barber who docked me and gelded me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-801" id="noteref-801" epub:type="noteref">801</a> and cauterised the wound.
When I revived I found myself a clean eunuch with nothing left,
and my master said to me, "Even as thou hast burned my heart
for the things I held dearest, so have I burnt thy heart for that
of thy members whereby thou settest most store!" Then he took
me and sold me at a profit, for that I was become an eunuch. And
I ceased not bringing trouble upon all, wherever I was sold, and
was shifted from lord to lord and from notable to notable, being
sold and being bought, till I entered the palace of the Commander
of the Faithful. But now my spirit is broken and my tricks are
gone from me, so—alas!—are my ballocks. When the two slaves
heard his history, they laughed at him and chaffed him and said,
"Truly thou art skite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-802" id="noteref-802" epub:type="noteref">802</a> and skite-son! Thou liedest an odious lie."
Then quoth they to the third slave, "Tell us thy tale." "O sons
of my uncle," quoth he, "all that ye have said is idle: I will tell
you the cause of my losing my testicles, and indeed I deserved to
lose even more, for I futtered both my mistress and my master's
eldest son and heir: but my story is a long one and this is not the
time to tell it; for the dawn, O my cousins, draweth near and if
morning come upon us with this chest still unburied, we shall get
into sore disgrace and our lives will pay for it. So up with you
and open the door and, when we get back to the palace, I will tell
you my story and the cause of my losing my precious stones."
Then he swarmed up and dropped down from the wall inside and
opened the door, so they entered and, setting down the lantern, dug
between four tombs a hole as long as the chest and of the same
breadth. Kafur plied the spade and Sawab removed the earth by
baskets-full till they reached the depth of the stature of a man;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-803" id="noteref-803" epub:type="noteref">803</a>
when they laid the chest in the hole and threw back the earth over
it: then they went forth and shutting the door disappeared from
Ghanim's eyes. When all was quiet and he felt sure that he was
left alone in the place, his thought was busied about what the chest
contained and he said to himself, "Would that I knew the contents
of that box!" However, he waited till day broke, when morning
shone and showed her sheen: whereupon he came down from the
date-tree and scooped away the earth with his hands, till the box
was laid bare and disengaged from the ground. Then he took a
large stone and hammered at the lock till he broke it and, opening
the lid, beheld a young lady, a model of beauty and loveliness, clad
in the richest of garments and jewels of gold and such necklaces
of precious stones that, were the Sultan's country evened with
them, it would not pay their price. She had been drugged with
Bhang, but her bosom, rising and falling, showed that her breath
had not departed. When Ghanim saw her, he knew that some
one had played her false and hocussed her; so he pulled her
out of the chest and laid her on the ground with her face upwards.
As soon as she smelt the breeze and the air entered her
nostrils, mouth and lungs, she sneezed and choked and coughed;
when there fell from out her throat a pill of Cretan Bhang, had an
elephant smelt it he would have slept from night to night. Then
she opened her eyes and glancing around said, in sweet voice and
gracious words, "Woe to thee O wind! there is naught in thee to
satisfy the thirsty, nor aught to gratify one whose thirst is satisfied!
Where is Zahr al-Bostan?" But no one answered her, so
she turned her and cried out, "Ho Sabíhah! Shajarat al-Durr!
Núr al-Hudá! Najmat al-Subh! be ye awake? Shahwah, Nuzhah,
Halwá, Zarífah, out on you, speak!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-804" id="noteref-804" epub:type="noteref">804</a>" But no one answered; so
she looked all around and said, "Woe's me! have they entombed
me in the tombs? O Thou who knowest what man's thought
enwombs and who givest compensation on the Day of Doom, who
can have brought me from amid hanging screens and curtains
veiling the Harím-rooms and set me down between four tombs?"
All this while Ghanim was standing by: then he said to her, "O
my lady, here are neither screened rooms nor palace-Haríms nor
yet tombs; only the slave henceforth devoted to thy love, Ghanim
bin Ayyub, sent to thee by the Omniscient One above, that all
thy troubles He may remove and win for thee every wish that
doth behove!" Then he held his peace. She was reassured by
his words and cried, "I testify that there is no god but <em>the</em> God,
and I testify that Mohammed is the Apostle of God!"; then she
turned to Ghanim and, placing her hands before her face, said to
him in the sweetest speech, "O blessed youth, who brought me
hither? See, I am now come to myself." "O my lady," he
replied, "three slave-eunuchs came here bearing this chest;" and
related to her the whole of what had befallen him, and how
evening having closed upon him had proved the cause of her preservation,
otherwise she had died smothered.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-805" id="noteref-805" epub:type="noteref">805</a> Then he asked
her who she was and what was her story, and she answered, "O
youth, thanks be to Allah who hath cast me into the hands of the
like of thee! But now rise and put me back into the box; then
fare forth upon the road and hire the first camel-driver or muleteer
thou findest to carry it to thy house. When I am there, all will
be well and I will tell thee my tale and acquaint thee with my
adventures, and great shall be thy gain by means of me." At this
he rejoiced and went outside the tomb. The day was now dazzling
bright and the firmament shone with light and the folk had begun
to circulate; so he hired a man with a mule and, bringing him to
the tomb, lifted the chest wherein he had put the damsel and set
it on the mule. Her love now engrossed his heart and he fared
homeward with her rejoicing, for that she was a girl worth ten
thousand gold pieces and her raiment and ornaments would fetch
a mint of money. As soon as he arrived at his house he carried in
the chest and opening it——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Forty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Ghanim son of Ayyub arrived with the chest at his house, he
opened it and took out the young lady, who looked about her and,
seeing that the place was handsome, spread with carpets and dight
with cheerful colours and other deckings; and noting the stuffs
up-piled and packed bales and other else than that, knew that he
was a substantial merchant and a man of much money. Thereupon
she uncovered her face and looked at him, and lo! he was a
fair youth; so when she saw him she loved him and said, "O my
lord, bring us something to eat." "On my head and mine eyes!"
replied he; and, going down to the bazar, bought a roasted lamb
and a dish of sweetmeats and with these dry fruits and wax-candles,
besides wine and whatsoever was required of drinking
materials, not forgetting perfumes. With all this gear he returned
to the house; and when the damsel saw him she laughed and
kissed him and clasped his neck. Then she began caressing him,
which made his love wax hotter till it got the mastery of his
heart. They ate and drank and each had conceived the fondest
affection; for indeed the two were one in age and one in loveliness;
and when night came on Ghanim bin Ayyub, the Distraught,
the Thrall of Love, rose and lit the wax candles and
lamps till the place blazed with light;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-806" id="noteref-806" epub:type="noteref">806</a> after which he produced
the wine-service and spread the table. Then both sat down again,
he and she, and he kept filling and giving her to drink, and she
kept filling and giving him to drink, and they played and toyed
and laughed and recited verses; whilst their joy increased and
they clove in closer love each to each (glory be to the Uniter of
Hearts!). They ceased not to carouse after this fashion till near
upon dawn when drowsiness overcame them and they slept where
they were, apart each from other, till the morning.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-807" id="noteref-807" epub:type="noteref">807</a> Then Ghanim
arose and going to the market, bought all they required of meat
and vegetables and wine and what not, and brought them to the
house; whereupon both sat down to eat and ate their sufficiency,
when he set on wine. They drank and each played with each, till
their cheeks flushed red and their eyes took a darker hue and
Ghanim's soul longed to kiss the girl and to lie with her and he
said, "O my lady, grant me one kiss of that dear mouth: perchance
'twill quench the fire of my heart." "O Ghanim," replied
she, "wait till I am drunk and dead to the world; then steal a
kiss of me, secretly and on such wise that I may not know thou
hast kissed me." Then she rose and taking off her upper dress sat
in a thin shift of fine linen and a silken head-kerchief.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-808" id="noteref-808" epub:type="noteref">808</a> At this
passion inflamed Ghanim and he said to her, "O my lady, wilt
thou not vouchsafe me what I asked of thee?" "By Allah," she
replied, "that may not be thine, for there is written upon my
trouser-string<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-809" id="noteref-809" epub:type="noteref">809</a> a hard word!" Thereupon Ghanim's heart sank
and desire grew on him as its object offered difficulties; and he
improvised these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I asked the author of mine ills ✿ To heal the wound with one sweet kiss:</div>
      <div class="line">No! No! she cried,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-810" id="noteref-810" epub:type="noteref">810</a> for ever no! ✿ But I, soft whispering, urged yes:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth she, Then take it by my leave, ✿ When smiles shall pardon thine amiss:</div>
      <div class="line">By force, cried I? Nay, she replied ✿ With love and gladness eke I wis.</div>
      <div class="line">Now ask me not what next occurred ✿ Seek grace of God and whist of this!</div>
      <div class="line">Deem what thou wilt of us, for love ✿ By calumnies the sweeter is:</div>
      <div class="line">Nor after this care I one jot ✿ Whether my foe be known or not.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then his affection increased and love-fires rose hotter in his heart,
while she refused herself to him saying, "Thou canst not possess
me." They ceased not to make love and enjoy their wine and
wassail, whilst Ghanim was drowned in the sea of love and longing;
but she redoubled in coyness and cruelty till the night brought on
the darkness and let fall on them the skirts of sleep. Thereupon
Ghanim rose and lit the lamps and wax-candles, and refreshed the
room and removed the table; then he took her feet and kissed
them and, finding them like fresh cream, pressed his face<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-811" id="noteref-811" epub:type="noteref">811</a> on them
and said to her, "O my lady, take pity on one thy love hath ta'en
and thine eyes hath slain; for indeed I were heart-whole but for
thy bane!" And he wept somewhat. "O my lord, and light of
my eyes," quoth she, "by Allah, I love thee in very sooth and I
trust to thy truth, but I know that I may not be thine." "And
what is the obstacle?" asked he; when she answered, "To-night I
will tell thee my tale, that thou mayst accept my excuse." Then
she threw herself upon him and winding her arms like a necklace
about his neck, kissed him and caressed him and promised him
her favours; and they ceased not playing and laughing till love
gat the firmest hold upon both their hearts. And so it continued
a whole month, both passing the night on a single carpet-bed, but
whenever he would enjoy her, she put him off; whilst mutual love
increased upon them and each could hardly abstain from other.
One night, as he lay by her side, and both were warm with wine,
Ghanim passed his hand over her breasts and stroked them; then
he slipped it down to her waist as far as her navel. She awoke
and, sitting up, put her hand to her trousers and finding them fast
tied, once more fell asleep. Presently, he again felt her and sliding
his hand down to her trouser-string, began pulling at it, whereupon
she awoke and sat upright. Ghanim also sat up by her side and
she asked him, "What dost thou want?" "I want to lie with
thee," he answered, "and that we may deal openly and frankly
with each other." Quoth she, "I must now declare to thee my
case, that thou mayst know my quality; then will my secret be
disclosed to thee and my excuse become manifest to thee." Quoth
he, "So be it!" Thereat she opened the skirt of her shift and,
taking up her trouser-string, said to him, "O my lord, read what
is worked on the flat of this string:" so he took it in hand, and
saw these words broidered on it in gold, "I AM THINE, AND
THOU ART MINE, O COUSIN OF THE APOSTLE!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-812" id="noteref-812" epub:type="noteref">812</a>
When he read this, he withdrew his hand and said to her, "Tell
me who thou art!" "So be it," answered she; "know that I
am one of the concubines of the Commander of the Faithful, and
my name is Kut al-Kulub—the Food of Hearts. I was brought
up in his palace and, when I grew to woman's estate, he looked
on me and, noting what share of beauty and loveliness the Creator
had given me, loved me with exceeding love, and assigned me a
separate apartment, and gave me ten slave-girls to wait on me
and all these ornaments thou seest me wearing. On a certain
day he set out for one of his provinces, and the Lady Zubaydah
came to one of the slave-girls in my service and said to her:—I
have something to require of thee. What is it, O my lady?
asked she and the Caliph's wife answered:—When thy mistress
Kut al-Kulub is asleep, put this piece of Bhang into her nostrils
or drop it into her drink, and thou shalt have of me as much money
as will satisfy thee. With love and gladness; replied the girl and
took the Bhang from her, being a glad woman because of the
money and because aforetime she had been one of Zubaydah's
slaves. So she put the Bhang in my drink, and when it was night
I drank, and the drug had no sooner settled in my stomach than
I fell to the ground, my head touching my feet, and knew naught
of my life but that I was in another world. When her device
succeeded, she bade put me in this chest, and secretly brought in
the slaves and the doorkeepers and bribed them; and, on the night
when thou wast perched upon the date-tree, she sent the blacks to
do with me as thou sawest. So my delivery was at thy hands, and
thou broughtest me to this house and hast entreated me honourably
and with thy kindest. This is my story, and I wot not what is
become of the Caliph during my absence. Know then my condition
and divulge not my case." When Ghanim heard her words
and knew that she was a concubine of the Caliph, he drew back,
for awe of the Caliphate beset him, and sat apart from her in one
of the corners of the place, blaming himself and brooding over his
affair and patiencing his heart bewildered for love of one he could
not possess. Then he wept for excess of longing, and plained him
of Fortune and her injuries, and the world and its enmities (and
praise be to Him who causeth generous hearts to be troubled with
love and the beloved, and who endoweth not the minds of the mean
and miserly with so much of it as eveneth a grain-weight!). So
he began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The lover's heart for his beloved must meet ✿ Sad pain, and from her charms bear sore defeat:</div>
      <div class="line">What is Loves taste? They asked and answered I, ✿ Sweet is the taste but ah! 'tis bitter-sweet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon Kut al-Kulub arose and took him to her bosom and
kissed him; for the love of him was firm fixed in her heart, so that
she disclosed to him her secret and all the affection she felt;
and, throwing her arms round Ghanim's neck like a collar of pearls,
kissed him again and yet again. But he held off from her in awe
of the Caliph. Then they talked together a long while (and indeed
both were drowned in the sea of their mutual love); and, as the day
broke, Ghanim rose and donned his clothes and going to the
bazar, as was his wont, took what the occasion required and
returned home. He found her weeping; but when she saw him
she checked herself and, smiling through her tears, said, "Thou
hast desolated me, O beloved of my heart. By Allah, this hour
of absence hath been to me like a year!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-813" id="noteref-813" epub:type="noteref">813</a> I have explained to
thee my condition in the excess of my eager love for thee; so
come now near me, and forget the past and have thy will of
me." But he interrupted her crying, "I seek refuge with Allah!
This thing may never be. How shall the dog sit in the lion's
stead? What is the lord's is unlawful to the slave!" So he withdrew
from her, and sat down on a corner of the mat. Her passion
for him increased with his forbearance; so she seated herself by
his side and caroused and played with him, till the two were
flushed with wine, and she was mad for her own dishonour.
Then she sang these verses:—</p>

<div class="figcenter id006">
<img src="images/i_062fp.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The lover's heart is like to break in twain: ✿ Till when these coy denials ah! till when?</div>
      <div class="line">O thou who fliest me sans fault of mine, ✿ Gazelles are wont at times prove tame to men:</div>
      <div class="line">Absence, aversion, distance and disdain, ✿ How shall young lover all these ills sustain?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon Ghanim wept and she wept at his weeping, and they
ceased not drinking till nightfall, when he rose and spread two
beds, each in its place. "For whom is this second bed?" asked
she, and he answered her, "One is for me and the other is for
thee: from this night forth we must not sleep save thus, for that
which is the lord's is unlawful to the thrall." "O my master!"
cried she, "let us have done with this, for all things come to
pass by Fate and Fortune." But he refused, and the fire was
lighted in her heart and, as her longing waxed fiercer, she clung
to him and cried, "By Allah, we will not sleep save side by side!"
"Allah forefend!" he replied and prevailed against her and lay
apart till the morning, when love and longing redoubled on her
and distraction and eager thirst of passion. They abode after this
fashion three full-told months, which were long and longsome
indeed, and every time she made advances to him, he would refuse
himself and say, "Whatever belongeth to the master is unlawful to
the man." Now when time waxed tiresome and tedious to her
and anguish and distress grew on her, she burst out from her
oppressed heart with these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How long, rare beauty! wilt do wrong to me? ✿ Who was it bade thee not belong to me?</div>
      <div class="line">With outer charms thou weddest inner grace ✿ Comprising every point of piquancy:</div>
      <div class="line">Passion thou hast infused in every heart, ✿ From eyelids driven sleep by deputy:</div>
      <div class="line">Erst was (I wot) the spray made thin of leaf ✿ O Cassia-spray! Unlief thy sin I see:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-814" id="noteref-814" epub:type="noteref">814</a></div>
      <div class="line">The hart erst hunted I: how is't I spy ✿ The hunter hunted (fair my hart!) by thee?</div>
      <div class="line">Wondrouser still I tell thee aye that I ✿ Am trapped while never up to trap thou be!</div>
      <div class="line">Ne'er grant my prayer! For if I grudge thyself ✿ To thee, I grudge my <em>me</em> more jealously;</div>
      <div class="line">And cry so long as life belong to me, ✿ Rare beauty how, how long this wrong to me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>They abode in this state a long time, and fear kept Ghanim aloof
from her. So far concerning these two; but as regards the Lady
Zubaydah, when, in the Caliph's absence she had done this deed by
Kut al-Kulub she became perplexed, saying to herself, "What shall
I tell my cousin when he comes back and asks for her? What
possible answer can I make to him?" Then she called an old
woman, who was about her and discovered her secret to her
saying, "How shall I act seeing that Kut al-Kulub died by such
untimely death?" "O my lady," quoth the old crone, "the time of
the Caliph's return is near; so do thou send for a carpenter and
bid him make thee a figure of wood in the form of a corpse. We
will dig a grave for it midmost the palace and there bury it: then
do thou build an oratory over it and set therein lighted candles
and lamps, and order each and every in the palace to be clad in
black.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-815" id="noteref-815" epub:type="noteref">815</a> Furthermore command thy handmaids and eunuchs as
soon as they know of the Caliph's returning from his journey, to
spread straw over the vestibule-floors and, when the Commander
of the Faithful enters and asks what is the matter, let them say:—Kut
al-Kulub is dead, and may Allah abundantly compensate thee
for the loss of her!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-816" id="noteref-816" epub:type="noteref">816</a>; and, for the high esteem in which she was
held of our mistress, she hath buried her in her own palace. When
he hears this he will weep and it shall be grievous to him; then
will he cause perlections of the Koran to be made for her and he
will watch by night at her tomb. Should he say to himself:—Verily
Zubaydah, the daughter of my uncle, hath compassed in her
jealousy the death of Kut al-Kulub; or, if love-longing overcome
him and he bid her be taken out of her tomb, fear thou not; for
when they dig down and come to the image in human shape he
will see it shrouded in costly grave-clothes; and, if he wish to take
off the winding-sheet that he may look upon her, do thou forbid
him or let some other forbid him, saying:—The sight of her nakedness
is unlawful. The fear of the world to come will restrain him
and he will believe that she is dead and will restore the figure to
its place and thank thee for thy doings; and thus thou shalt
escape, please Almighty Allah, from this slough of despond."
When the Lady Zubaydah heard her words, she commended the
counsel and gave her a dress of honour and a large sum of money,
ordering her to do all she had said. So the old woman set about
the business forthright and bade the carpenter make her the aforesaid
image; and, as soon as it was finished, she brought it to the
lady Zubaydah, who shrouded it and buried it and built a sepulchre
over it, wherein they lighted candles and lamps, and laid down
carpets about the tomb. Moreover she put on black and she
spread abroad in the Harim that Kut al-Kulub was dead. After
a time the Caliph returned from his journey and went up to the
palace, thinking only of Kut al-Kulub. He saw all the pages and
eunuchs and handmaids habited in black, at which his heart
fluttered with extreme fear; and, when he went in to the Lady
Zubaydah, he found her also garbed in black. So he asked the
cause of this and they gave him tidings of the death of Kut al-Kulub,
whereon he fell a-swooning. As soon as he came to himself,
he asked for her tomb, and the Lady Zubaydah said to him,
"Know, O Prince of the Faithful, that for especial honour I have
buried her in my own palace." Then he repaired in his travelling-garb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-817" id="noteref-817" epub:type="noteref">817</a>
to the tomb that he might wail over her, and found the
carpets spread and the candles and lamps lighted. When he saw
this, he thanked Zubaydah for her good deed and abode perplexed,
halting between belief and unbelief till at last suspicion overcame
him and he gave order to open the grave and take out the body.
When he saw the shroud and would have removed it to look upon
her, the fear of Allah Almighty restrained him, and the old woman
(taking advantage of the delay) said, "Restore her to her place."
Then he sent at once for Fakirs and Koran-readers, and caused
perlections to be made over her tomb and sat by the side of the
grave, weeping till he fainted; and he continued to frequent the
tomb and sit there for a whole month,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Forty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph
ceased not to frequent the tomb for the period of a whole month,
at the end of which time it so happened one day that he entered
the Serraglio, after dismissing the Emirs and Wazirs, and lay down
and slept awhile; and there sat at his head a slave-girl fanning
him, and at his feet a second rubbing and shampooing them.
Presently he awoke and, opening his eyes, shut them again and
heard the handmaid at his head saying to her who was at his feet,
"A nice business this, O Khayzarán!" and the other answered
her "Well, O Kazíb al-Bán?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-818" id="noteref-818" epub:type="noteref">818</a> "Verily" said the first, "our lord
knoweth naught of what hath happened and sitteth waking and
watching by a tomb wherein is only a log of wood carved by the
carpenter's art." "And Kut al-Kulub," quoth the other, "what
hath befallen her?" She replied, "Know that the Lady Zubaydah
sent a pellet of Bhang by one of the slave-women who was bribed
to drug her; and when sleep overpowered her she let put her in a
chest, and ordered Sawab and Kafur and Bukhayt to throw her
amongst the tombs." "What dost thou say, O Kazíb al-Bán;"
asked Khayzarán, "is not the lady Kut al-Kulub dead?" "Nay,
by Allah!" she answered "and long may her youth be saved
from death! but I have heard the Lady Zubaydah say that she is
in the house of a young merchant named Ghanim bin Ayyub of
Damascus, hight the Distraught, the Thrall o' Love; and she hath
been with him these four months, whilst our lord is weeping and
watching by night at a tomb wherein is no corpse." They kept on
talking this sort of talk, and the Caliph gave ear to their words;
and, by the time they had ceased speaking, he knew right well
that the tomb was a feint and a fraud, and that Kut al-Kulub had
been in Ghanim's house for four months. Whereupon he was
angered with exceeding anger and rising up, he summoned the
Emirs of his state; and his Wazir Ja'afar the Barmaki came also
and kissed the ground between his hands. The Caliph said to him
in fury; "Go down, O Ja'afar, with a party of armed men and ask
for the house of Ghanim son of Ayyub: fall upon it and spoil it
and bring him to me with my slave-girl, Kut al-Kulub, for there
is no help but that I punish him!" "To hear is to obey," said
Ja'afar; and setting out with the Governor and the guards and a
world of people, repaired to Ghanim's house. Now about that
time the youth happened to have brought back a pot of dressed
meat and was about to put forth his hand to eat of it, he and Kut
al-Kulub, when the lady, happening to look out saw calamity surrounding
the house on every side; for the Wazir and the Governor,
the night-guard and the Mamelukes with swords drawn had girt it
as the white of the eye girdeth the black. At this she knew that
tidings of her had reached the Caliph, her lord; and she made sure
of ruin, and her colour paled and her fair features changed and her
favour faded. Then she turned to Ghanim and said to him, "O
my love? fly for thy life!" "What shall I do," asked he, "and
whither shall I go, seeing that my money and means of maintenance
are all in this house?"; and she answered, "Delay not
lest thou be slain and lose life as well as wealth." "O my loved
one and light of mine eyes!" he cried, "How shall I do to get
away when they have surrounded the house?" Quoth she, "Fear
not;" and, stripping off his fine clothes, dressed him in ragged old
garments, after which she took the pot and, putting in it bits of
broken bread and a saucer of meat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-819" id="noteref-819" epub:type="noteref">819</a> placed the whole in a basket
and setting it upon his head said, "Go out in this guise and fear
not for me who wotteth right well what thing is in my hand for
the Caliph."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-820" id="noteref-820" epub:type="noteref">820</a> So he went out amongst them, bearing the basket
with its contents, and the Protector vouchsafed him His protection
and he escaped the snares and perils that beset him, by the blessing
of his good conscience and pure conduct. Meanwhile Ja'afar dismounted
and entering the house, saw Kut al-Kulub who had dressed
and decked herself in splendid raiments and ornaments and filled a
chest with gold and jewellery and precious stones and rarities and
what else was light to bear and of value rare. When she saw Ja'afar
come in, she rose and, kissing the ground before him, said, "O my
lord, the Reed hath written of old the rede which Allah decreed!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-821" id="noteref-821" epub:type="noteref">821</a>
"By Allah, O my lady," answered Ja'afar, "he gave me an order
to seize Ghanim son of Ayyub;" and she rejoined, "O my lord,
he made ready his goods and set out therewith for Damascus and
I know nothing more of him; but I desire thee take charge of this
chest and deliver it to me in the Harim of the Prince of the Faithful."
"Hearing and obedience," said Ja'afar, and bade his men
bear it away to the head-quarters of the Caliphate together with
Kut al-Kulub, commanding them to entreat her with honour as one
in high esteem. They did his bidding after they had wrecked and
plundered Ghanim's house. Then Ja'afar went in to the Caliph and
told him all that had happened, and he ordered Kut al-Kulub to be
lodged in a dark chamber and appointed an old woman to serve her,
feeling convinced that Ghanim had debauched her and slept with
her. Then he wrote a mandate to the Emir Mohammed bin Sulayman
al-Zayni, his viceroy in Damascus, to this effect:—"The instant
thou shalt receive this our letter, seize upon Ghanim bin Ayyub and
send him to us." When the missive came to the viceroy, he kissed
it and laid it on his head; then he let proclaim in the bazars,
"Whoso is desirous to plunder, away with him to the house of
Ghanim son of Ayyub."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-822" id="noteref-822" epub:type="noteref">822</a> So they flocked thither, when they found
that Ghanim's mother and sister had built him a tomb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-823" id="noteref-823" epub:type="noteref">823</a> in the
midst of the house and sat by it weeping for him; whereupon they
seized the two without telling them the cause and, after spoiling
the house, carried them before the viceroy. He questioned them
concerning Ghanim and both replied, "For a year or more we have
had no news of him." So they restored them to their place. Thus
far concerning them; but as regards Ghanim, when he saw his
wealth spoiled and his ruin utterest he wept over himself till his
heart well-nigh brake. Then he fared on at random till the last
of the day, and hunger grew hard on him and walking wearied
him. So coming to a village he entered a mosque<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-824" id="noteref-824" epub:type="noteref">824</a> where he sat
down upon a mat and propped his back against the wall; but
presently he sank to the ground in his extremity of famine and
fatigue. There he lay till dawn, his heart fluttering for want of
food; and, owing to his sweating, the lice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-825" id="noteref-825" epub:type="noteref">825</a> coursed over his skin;
his breath waxed fetid and his whole condition was changed.
When the villagers came to pray the dawn-prayer, they found him
prostrate, ailing, hunger-lean, yet showing evident signs of former
affluence. As soon as prayers were over, they drew near him;
and, understanding that he was starved with hunger and cold,
they gave him an old robe with ragged sleeves and said to him,
"O stranger, whence art thou and what sickness is upon thee?"
He opened his eyes and wept but returned no answer; whereupon
one of them, who saw that he was starving, brought him a saucer
of honey and two barley scones. He ate a little and they sat
with him till sun-rise, when they went to their work. He abode
with them in this state for a month, whilst sickness and weakliness
grew upon him; and they wept for him and, pitying his
condition, took counsel with one another upon his case and agreed
to forward him to the hospital in Baghdad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-826" id="noteref-826" epub:type="noteref">826</a> Meanwhile behold,
two beggar-women, who were none other than Ghanim's mother
and sister,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-827" id="noteref-827" epub:type="noteref">827</a> came into the mosque and, when he saw them, he gave
them the bread that was at his head; and they slept by his side
that night but he knew them not. Next day the villagers brought
a camel and said to the cameleer, "Set this sick man on thy beast
and carry him to Baghdad and put him down at the Spital-door;
so haply he may be medicined and be healed and thou shalt have
thy hire."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-828" id="noteref-828" epub:type="noteref">828</a> "To hear is to comply," said the man. So they brought
Ghanim, who was asleep, out of the mosque and set him, mat and all,
on the camel; and his mother and sister came out among the crowd
to gaze upon him, but they knew him not. However, after looking
at him and considering him carefully they said, "Of a truth
he favours our Ghanim, poor boy!; can this sick man be he?"
Presently, he woke and finding himself bound with ropes on a
camel's back, he began to weep and complain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-829" id="noteref-829" epub:type="noteref">829</a> and the village-people
saw his mother and sister weeping over him, albeit they
knew him not. Then they fared forth for Baghdad, but the
camel-man forewent them and, setting Ghanim down at the
Spital-gate, went away with his beast. The sick man lay there
till dawn and, when the folk began to go about the streets, they
saw him and stood gazing on him, for he had become as thin as a
toothpick, till the Syndic of the bazar came up and drove them
away from him, saying, "I will gain Paradise through this poor
creature; for if they take him into the Hospital, they will kill him
in a single day."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-830" id="noteref-830" epub:type="noteref">830</a> Then he made his young men carry him to his
house, where they spread him a new bed with a new pillow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-831" id="noteref-831" epub:type="noteref">831</a> and
he said to his wife, "Tend him carefully;" and she replied, "Good!
on my head be it!" Thereupon she tucked up her sleeves and
warming some water, washed his hands, feet and body; after which
she clothed him in a robe belonging to one of her slave-girls and
made him drink a cup of wine and sprinkled rose-water over
him. So he revived and complained, and the thought of his
beloved Kut al-Kulub made his grief redouble. Thus far concerning
him; but as regards Kut al-Kulub, when the Caliph was
angered against her,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Forty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Caliph was angered against Kut al-Kulub, he ordered her to a
dark chamber where she abode eighty days, at the end of which
the Caliph, happening to pass on a certain day the place where she
was, heard her repeating poetry, and after she ceased reciting her
verse, saying, "O my darling, O my Ghanim! how great is thy
goodness and how chaste is thy nature! thou didst well by one
who did ill by thee and thou guardedst his honour who garred
thine become dishonour, and his Harim thou didst protect who to
enslave thee and thine did elect! But thou shalt surely stand,
thou and the Commander of the Faithful, before the Just Judge,
and thou shalt be justified of him on the Day when the Lord (to
whom be honour and glory!) shall be Kazi and the Angels of
Heaven shall be witnesses!" When the Caliph heard her complaint,
he knew that she had been wronged and, returning to the palace,
sent Masrur the Eunuch for her. She came before him with
bowed head and eyes tearful and heart sorrowful; and he said
to her, "O Kut al-Kulub, I find thou accusest me of tyranny and
oppression, and thou avouchest that I have done ill by one who
did well by me. Who is this who hath guarded my honour while
I garred his become dishonour? Who protected my Harim and
whose Harim I wrecked?" "He is Ghanim son of Ayyub,"
replied she, "for he never approached me in wantonness or with
lewd intent, I swear by thy munificence, O Commander of the
Faithful!" Then said the Caliph, "There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah! Ask what thou wilt of me, O
Kut al-Kulub." "O Prince of the Faithful!", answered she, "I
require of thee only my beloved Ghanim son of Ayyub." He did
as she desired, whereupon she said, "O Lord of the Moslems, if I
bring him to thy presence, wilt thou bestow me on him?"; and he
replied, "If he come into my presence, I will give thee to him
as the gift of the generous who revoketh not his largesse." "O
Prince of True Believers," quoth she, "suffer me to go and seek
him; haply Allah may unite me with him:" and quoth he, "Do
even as thou wilt." So she rejoiced and, taking with her a thousand
dinars in gold, went out and visited the elders of the various
faiths and gave alms in Ghanim's name.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-832" id="noteref-832" epub:type="noteref">832</a> Next day she walked
to the merchants' bazar and disclosed her object to the Syndic
and gave him money, saying, "Bestow this in charity to the
stranger!" On the following Friday she fared to the bazar (with
other thousand dinars) and, entering the goldsmiths' and jewellers'
market-street, called the Chief and presented to him a thousand
dinars with these words, "Bestow this in charity to the stranger!"
The Chief looked at her (and he was the Syndic who had taken in
Ghanim) and said, "O my lady, wilt thou come to my house and
look upon a youth, a stranger I have there and see how goodly
and graceful he is?" Now the stranger was Ghanim, son of
Ayyub, but the Chief had no knowledge of him and thought him
to be some wandering pauper, some debtor whose wealth had
been taken from him, or some lover parted from his beloved.
When she heard his words her heart fluttered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-833" id="noteref-833" epub:type="noteref">833</a> and her vitals
yearned, and she said to him, "Send with me one who shall
guide me to thy house." So he sent a little lad who brought her
to the house wherein was the head man's stranger-guest and she
thanked him for this. When she reached the house, she went in
and saluted the Syndic's wife, who rose and kissed the ground
between her hands, for she knew her. Then quoth Kut al-Kulub,
"Where is the sick man who is with thee?" She wept and
replied, "Here is he, O my lady; by Allah, he is come of good
folk and he beareth the signs of gentle breeding: you see him
lying on yonder bed." So she turned and looked at him: and
she saw something like him, but he was worn and wasted till he
had become lean as a toothpick, so his identity was doubtful to
her and she could not be certain that it was he. Yet pity for him
possessed her and she wept saying, "Verily the stranger is unhappy,
even though he be a prince in his own land!"; and his
case was grievous to her and her heart ached for him, yet she
knew him not to be Ghanim. Then she furnished him with wine
and medicines and she sat awhile by his head, after which she
mounted and returned to her palace and continued to visit every
bazar in quest of her lover. Meanwhile Ghanim's mother and
sister Fitnah arrived at Baghdad and met the Syndic, who carried
them to Kut al-Kulub and said to her, "O Princess of beneficent
ladies, there came to our city this day a woman and her daughter,
who are fair of favour and signs of good breeding and dignity are
apparent in them, though they be dressed in hair-cloth and have
each one a wallet hanging to her neck; and their eyes are tearful
and their hearts are sorrowful. So I have brought them to thee
that thou mayst give them refuge, and rescue them from beggary,
for they are not of asker-folk and, if it please Allah, we shall enter
Paradise through them." "By Allah, O my master," cried she,
"thou makest me long to see them! Where are they?", adding,
"Here with them to me!" So he bade the eunuch bring them in;
and, when she looked on them and saw that they were both of
distinguished beauty, she wept for them and said, "By Allah,
these are people of condition and show plain signs of former
opulence." "O my lady," said the Syndic's wife, "we love the
poor and the destitute, more especially as reward in Heaven
will recompense our love; and, as for these persons, haply the
oppressor hath dealt hardly with them and hath plundered their
property and harried their houses." Then Ghanim's mother and
sister wept with sore weeping, remembering their former prosperity
and contrasting it with their present poverty and miserable
condition; and their thoughts dwelt upon son and brother, whilst
Kut al-Kulub wept for their weeping; and they said, "We beseech
Allah to reunite us with him whom we desire, and he is none other
but my son named Ghanim bin Ayyub!" When Kut al-Kulub
heard this, she knew them to be the mother and sister of her lover
and wept till a swoon came over her. When she revived she
turned to them and said, "Have no fear and sorrow not, for this
day is the first of your prosperity and the last of your adversity!"
——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Forty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kut
al-Kulub had consoled them she bade the Syndic lead them to his
house and let his wife carry them to the Hamman and dress them
in handsome clothes and take care of them and honour them with
all honour; and she gave him a sufficient sum of money. Next
day, she mounted and, riding to his house, went in to his wife who
rose up and kissed her hands and thanked her for her kindness.
There she saw Ghanim's mother and sister whom the Syndic's wife
had taken to the Hammam and clothed afresh, so that the traces
of their former condition became manifest upon them. She sat
talking with them awhile, after which she asked the wife about the
sick youth who was in her house and she replied, "He is in the
same state." Then said Kut al-Kulub, "Come, let us go and visit
him." So she arose, she and the Chief's wife and Ghanim's mother
and sister, and went in to the room where he lay and sat down
near him. Presently Ghanim bin Ayyub, the Distraught, the
Thrall o' Love, heard them mention the name of Kut al-Kulub;
whereupon life returned to him, emaciated and withered as he was,
and he raised his head from the pillow and cried aloud, "O Kut
al-Kulub!" She looked at him and made certain it was he and
shrieked rather than said, "Yes, O my beloved!" "Draw near to
me;" said he, and she replied, "Surely thou art Ghanim bin
Ayyub?"; and he rejoined "I am indeed!" Hereupon a swoon
came upon her; and, as soon as Ghanim's mother and his sister
Fitnah heard these words, both cried out "O our joy!" and fainted
clean away. When they all recovered, Kut al-Kulub exclaimed,
"Praise be to Allah who hath brought us together again and who
hath reunited thee with thy mother and thy sister!" And she
related to him all that had befallen her with the Caliph and said,
"I have made known the truth to the Commander of the Faithful,
who believed my words and was pleased with thee; and now he
desireth to see thee," adding, "He hath given me to thee." Thereat
he rejoiced with extreme joy, when she said, "Quit not this place
till I come back" and, rising forthwith, betook herself to her palace.
There she opened the chest which she had brought from Ghanim's
house and, taking out some of the dinars, gave them to the Syndic
saying, "Buy with this money for each of them four complete suits
of the finest stuffs and twenty kerchiefs, and else beside of whatsoever
they require;" after which she carried all three to the baths
and had them washed and bathed and made ready for them
consommés, and galangale-water and cider against their coming
out. When they left the Hammam, they put on the new clothes,
and she abode with them three days feeding them with chicken
meats and bouillis, and making them drink sherbet of sugar candy.
After three days their spirits returned; and she carried them again
to the baths, and when they came out and had changed their
raiment, she led them back to the Syndic's house and left them
there, whilst she returned to the palace and craved permission to
see the Caliph. When he ordered her to come in, she entered and,
kissing the ground between his hands, told him the whole story and
how her lord, Ghanim bin Ayyub, yclept the Distraught, the Thrall
o' Love, and his mother and sister were now in Baghdad. When
the Caliph heard this, he turned to the eunuchs and said, "Here
with Ghanim to me." So Ja'afar went to fetch him; but Kut
al-Kulub forewent him and told Ghanim, "The Caliph hath sent to
fetch thee before him," and charged him to show readiness of
tongue and firmness of heart and sweetness of speech. Then she
robed him in a sumptuous dress and gave him dinars in plenty,
saying, "Be lavish of largesse to the Caliph's household as thou
goest in to him." Presently Ja'afar, mounted on his Nubian mule,
came to fetch him; and Ghanim advanced to welcome the Wazir
and, wishing him long life, kissed the ground before him. Now
the star of his good fortune had risen and shone brightly; and
Ja'afar took him; and they ceased not faring together, he and the
Minister, till they went in to the Commander of the Faithful.
When he stood in the presence, he looked at the Wazirs and Emirs
and Chamberlains, and Viceroys and Grandees and Captains, and
then at the Caliph. Hereupon he sweetened his speech and his
eloquence and, bowing his head to the ground, broke out in these
extempore couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">May that Monarch's life span a mighty span, ✿ Whose lavish of largesse all lieges scan:</div>
      <div class="line">None other but he shall be Kaysar hight, ✿ Lord of lordly hall and of haught Divan:</div>
      <div class="line">Kings lay their gems on his threshold-dust ✿ As they bow and salam to the mighty man;</div>
      <div class="line">And his glances foil them and all recoil, ✿ Bowing beards aground and with faces wan:</div>
      <div class="line">Yet they gain the profit of royal grace, ✿ The rank and station of high soldan.</div>

      <div class="line">May the King of Kings ever hold thee dear; ✿ Be counsel thine and right steadfast plan,</div>
      <div class="line">Till thy justice spread o'er the wide-spread earth ✿ And the near and the far be of equal worth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he ended his improvisation the Caliph was pleased by it and
marvelled at the eloquence of his tongue and the sweetness of his
speech,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Forty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Caliph,
after marvelling at his eloquence of tongue and sweetness of speech,
said to him, "Draw near to me." So he drew near and quoth the
King, "Tell me thy tale and declare to me thy case." So Ghanim
sat down and related to him what had befallen him in Baghdad, of
his sleeping in the tomb and of his opening the chest after the
three slaves had departed, and informed him, in short, of everything
that had happened to him from commencement to conclusion—none
of which we will repeat for interest fails in twice told tales.
The Caliph was convinced that he was a true man; so he invested
him with a dress of honour, and placed him near himself in token
of favour, and said to him, "Acquit me of the responsibility I have
incurred."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-835" id="noteref-835" epub:type="noteref">835</a> And Ghanim so did, saying, "O our lord the Sultan, of
a truth thy slave and all things his two hands own are his master's."
The Caliph was pleased at this and gave orders to set apart a
palace for him and assigned to him pay and allowances, rations and
donations, which amounted to something immense. So he removed
thither with sister and mother; after which the Caliph, hearing
that his sister Fitnah was in beauty a very "fitnah,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-836" id="noteref-836" epub:type="noteref">836</a> a mere seduction,
demanded her in marriage of Ghanim who replied, "She is thy
handmaid as I am thy slave." The Caliph thanked him and gave
him an hundred thousand dinars, then summoned the witnesses
and the Kazi, and on one and the same day they wrote out the
two contracts of marriage between the Caliph and Fitnah and between
Ghanim bin Ayyub and Kut al-Kulub; and the two marriages
were consummated on one and the same night. When it was
morning, the Caliph gave orders to record the history of what had
befallen Ghanim from first to last and to deposit it in the royal
muniment-rooms, that those who came after him might read it and
marvel at the dealings of Destiny and put their trust in Him who
created the night and the day. Yet, O auspicious King, this story
to which thou hast deigned give ear is on no wise more wondrous
