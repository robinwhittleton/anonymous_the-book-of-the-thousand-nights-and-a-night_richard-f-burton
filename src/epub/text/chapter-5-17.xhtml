			<p>The Caliph Harun al-Rashid went up one noontide to his couch, to lie down; and mounting, found upon the bed-clothes semen freshly emitted; whereat he was startled and troubled with sore trouble. So he called the Lady Zubaydah and said to her, “What is that spilt on the bed?” She looked at it and replied, “O Commander of the Faithful, it is semen.” Quoth he, “Tell me truly what this meaneth or I will lay violent hands on thee forthright.” Quoth she, “By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, indeed I know not how it came there and I am guiltless of that whereof thou suspectest me.” So he sent for the Kazi Abú Yúsuf and acquainted him of the case. The Judge raised his eyes to the ceiling and, seeing a crack therein, said to the Caliph, “O Commander of the Faithful, in very sooth the bat hath seed like that of a man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2195" id="noteref-2195" epub:type="noteref">2195</a> and this is bat’s semen.” Then he called for a spear and thrust it into the crevice, whereupon down fell the bat.

Quoth she, “What is the difference between them?” and quoth he, “As often as I think to praise one kind, the adversary putteth in its claim.” The Caliph laughed at his answer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2196" id="noteref-2196" epub:type="noteref">2196</a> and made him a rich present; and Zubaydah also gave him what she had promised him, and he went away, rejoicing. See, then the virtues of this Imám and how at his hands were manifest the truth and the innocence of the Lady Zubaydah. And amongst other stories is that of</p>
