			<h2 epub:type="title">Night Adventure of Hárún al-Rashid and the Youth Manjab<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7206" id="noteref-7206" epub:type="noteref">7206</a></h2>

<p>It is told in various relations of the folk (but Allah is All-knowing
of His secret purpose and All-powerful and All-beneficent and
All-merciful in whatso of bygone years transpired and amid
peoples of old took place) that the Caliph Hárún al-Rashíd being
straitened of breast one day summoned his Chief of the Eunuchs
and said to him, “O Masrúr!” Quoth he, “Adsum, O my
lord;” and quoth the other, “This day my breast is straitened
and I would have thee bring me somewhat to hearten my heart
and consume my care.” Replied Masrur, “O my lord, do thou go
forth to thy garden and look upon the trees and the blooms and
the rills and listen to the warblings of the fowls.” Harun replied,
“O Masrur, thou hast mentioned a matter which palleth on my
palate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7207" id="noteref-7207" epub:type="noteref">7207</a> nor may my breast be broadened by aught thou hast
commended.” Rejoined the Eunuch, “Then do thou enter thy
palace and having gathered thy handmaids before thee, let each
and every say her say whilst all are robed in the choicest of
raiment and ornaments; so shalt thou look upon them and thy
spirits shall be cheered.” The Caliph retorted, “O Masrur, we
want other than this;” whereupon quoth the slave, “O Prince of
True Believers, send after the Wazirs and thy brotherhood of
learned men and let them improvise for thee poetry and set before
thee stories whereby shall thy care be solaced.” Quoth he, “O
Masrur, naught of this shall profit me.” Hereat cried the Eunuch,
“Then, O my lord, I see naught for thee save to take thy sabre
and smite the neck of thy slave: haply and peradventure this may
comfort thee and do away with thy disgust.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7208" id="noteref-7208" epub:type="noteref">7208</a> When the King
Harun al-Rashid heard these words, he laughed aloud and said to
him, “O Masrur, go forth to the gate where haply thou shalt find
some one of my cup-companions.” Accordingly he went to the
porte in haste and there came upon one of the courtiers which was
Ali ibn Mansúr Al-Dimishkí and brought him in. The Commander
of the Faithful seeing him bade him be seated and said,
“O Ibn Mansur, I would have thee tell me a tale somewhat rare
and strange; so perchance my breast may be broadened and my
doleful dumps from me depart.” Said he, “O Prince of True
Believers, dost thou desire that I relate to thee of the things
which are past and gone or I recount a matter I espied with
my own eyes?” Al-Rashid replied, “An thou have sighted
somewhat worthy seeing relate it to us for hearing is not like
beholding.” He rejoined, “O Emir al-Muuminín, whilst I tell
thee this tale needs must thou lend me ear and mind;” and the
Caliph<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7209" id="noteref-7209" epub:type="noteref">7209</a> retorted, “Out with thy story, for here am I hearkening
to thee with ears and eyes wide awake, so that my soul may
understand the whole of this say.” Hereupon Ibn Mansur related
to him</p>

<div>

  <h3 class="c013"><em>THE LOVES OF THE LOVERS OF BASSORAH.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7210" id="noteref-7210" epub:type="noteref">7210</a></h3>
</div>

<p class="c014">Now when Al-Rashid heard the tale of Ibn Mansur there fell
from him somewhat of his cark and care but he was not wholly
comforted. He spent the night in this case and when it was
morning he summoned the Wazir Ja’afar ibn Yahyá the Barmaki,
and cried to him, “O Ja’afar!” He replied, “Here am I! Allah
lengthen thy life, and make permanent thy prosperity.” The
Caliph resumed, “Verily my breast is straitened and it hath
passed through my thought that we fare forth, I and thou (and
Eunuch Masrur shall make a third), and we will promenade the
main streets of Baghdad and solace ourselves with seeing its
several places and peradventure I may espy somewhat to hearten
my heart and clear off my care and relieve me of what is with me
of straitness of breast.” Ja’afar made answer, “O Commander of
the Faithful, know that thou art Caliph and Regent and Cousin to
the Apostle of Allah and haply some of the sons of the city may
speak words that suit thee not and from that matter may result
other matter with discomfort to thy heart and annoyance to thy
mind, the offender unknowing the while that thou art walking the
streets by night. Then thou wilt command his head to be cut off
and what was meant for pleasure may end in displeasure and wrath
and wrong-doing.” Al-Rashid replied, “I swear by the rights of
my forbears and ancestors even if aught mishap to us from the
meanest of folk as is wont to happen or he speak words which
should not be spoken, that I will neither regard them nor reply
thereto, neither will I punish the aggressor, nor shall aught linger
in my heart against the addresser; but need must I pass through
the Bazar this very night.” Hereupon quoth Ja’afar to the
Caliph, “O Viceregent of Allah upon earth, do thou be steadfast
of purpose and rely upon Allah!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7211" id="noteref-7211" epub:type="noteref">7211</a> Then they arose and arousing
Masrur doffed what was upon them of outer dress and bag-trousers
and habited themselves each one of them in garments differing
from those of the city folks. Presently they sallied forth by the
private postern and walked from place to place till they came to
one of the highways of the capital and after threading its length
they arrived at a narrow street whose like was never seen about
all the horizons.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7212" id="noteref-7212" epub:type="noteref">7212</a> This they found swept and sprinkled with the
sweet northern breeze playing through it and at the head thereof
rose a mansion towering from the dust and hanging from the
necks of the clouds. Its whole length was of sixty cubits
whereas its breadth was of twenty ells; its gate was of ebony
inlaid with ivory and plated with plates of yellow brass while
athwart the doorway hung a curtain of sendal and over it was a
chandelier of gold fed with oil of ’Irákí violets which brightened
all that quarter with its light. The King Harun al-Rashid and
the Wazir and the Eunuch stood marvelling at what they saw of
these signs and at what they smelt of the scents breathing from
the clarity<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7213" id="noteref-7213" epub:type="noteref">7213</a> of this palace as though they were the waftings of the
perfumed gardens of Paradise and they cast curious glances at the
abode so lofty and of base so goodly and of corners so sturdy,
whose like was never builded in those days. Presently they
noted that its entrance was poikilate with carvings manifold and
arabesques of glittering gold and over it was a line writ in
letters of lapis lazuli. So Al-Rashid took seat under the
candelabrum with Ja’afar standing on his right and Masrur afoot
to his left and he exclaimed, “O Wazir, this mansion is naught
save in the utmost perfection of beauty and degree; and verily its
lord must have expended upon it wealth galore and of gold a
store; and, as its exterior is magnificent exceedingly, so would to
Heaven I knew what be its interior.” Then the Caliph cast a
glance at the upper lintel of the door whereupon he saw inscribed
in letters of golden water which glittered in the rays of the
chandelier,</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“WHOSO SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT SHALL HEAR WHAT PLEASETH HIM NOT.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereupon quoth Al-Rashid, “O Ja’afar, the house-master never
wrote yonder lines save for a reason and I desire to discover what
may be his object, so let us forgather with him and ask him the
cause of this legend being inscribed in this place.” Quoth Ja’afar,
“O Prince of True Believers, yonder lines were never written save
in fear of the curtain of concealment being withdrawn.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night, and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ja’afar the
Barmecide said to the King, “Verily the master of this house
never wrote yonder lines save in fear lest the curtain of concealment
be withdrawn.” Hearing this the Caliph held his peace for
a while and fell to pondering this matter then said he, “O Ja’afar,
knock at the door and ask for us a gugglet of water;” and when
the Wazir did his bidding one of the slaves called out from within
the entrance, “Who is it rappeth at our gate?” Hereupon said
Masrur to him, “O son of my uncle, open to us the door and give
us a gugglet of water for that our lord thirsteth.” The chattel
went in to his master, the young man, Manjáb hight, who owned
the mansion, and said, “O my lord, verily there be at our door
three persons who have rapped for us and who ask for a drink of
water.” The master asked, “What manner of men may they
be?” and the slave answered, “One of them sitteth under the
chandelier and another of them standeth by his side and the third
is a black slave between their hands; and all three show signs of
staidness and dignity than which naught can be more.” “Go forth
to them,” exclaimed the master, “and say to them:—My lord
inviteth you to become of his guests.” So the servile went out
and delivered the message, whereat they entered and found five
lines of inscription in different parts of the hall with a candelabrum
overhanging each and every and the whole five contained the
sentence we have before mentioned; furthermore all the lights
were hung up over the legend that the writing might be made
manifest unto whoso would read it. Accordingly Harun al-Rashid
entered and found a mansion of kingly degree<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7214" id="noteref-7214" epub:type="noteref">7214</a> and of marvellous
ordinance in the utmost that could be of beauty and ornament
and five black slaves and as many Eunuchs were standing in the
saloon to offer their services. Seeing this the Caliph marvelled
with extreme marvel at the house and the house-master who
greeted them in friendly guise; after which he to whom the
palace belonged sat down upon a divan and bade Al-Rashid sit
over against him and signed to Ja’afar and Masrur to take their
places in due degree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7215" id="noteref-7215" epub:type="noteref">7215</a> whilst the negroes and the eunuchs stood
expecting their commands for suit and service. Presently was
brought to them a huge waxen taper which lighted up the whole
of the hall and the young house-master accosted the King and
said to him, “Well come and welcome and fair welcome to our
guests who to us are the most esteemed of folk and may Allah
honour their places!” Hereupon he began to repeat the following
couplets:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7216" id="noteref-7216" epub:type="noteref">7216</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“If the house knew who visits it, it would indeed rejoice And stoop to kiss the happy place whereon her feet have stood;</div>
      <div class="line">And in the voice with which the case, though mute, yet speaks, Exclaim, ’Wellcome and many a welcome to the generous, and the good.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Presently Manjab the master of the house bade bring for his guests
meats and viands meet for the great, of all kinds and of every
colour, so they obeyed his orders and when they had eaten their
sufficiency they were served with confections perfumed with rosewater
wondrous fine. Hereupon quoth the youth to Al-Rashid
and those with him, “Almighty Allah make it pleasant to you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7217" id="noteref-7217" epub:type="noteref">7217</a>
and blame us not and accept our excuses for what Allah hath
made easy to us at such time of night, and there is no doubt but
that this be a fortunate day when ye made act of presence before
us.” They thanked him and Al-Rashid’s breast was broadened
and his heart was heartened and there fell from him all that whilom
irked him. Then the youth shifted them from that place to
another room which was the women’s apartment; and here he
seated them upon the highest Divan and bade serve to them a
platter containing fruits of all descriptions and ordered his servants
to bring roast meats and fried meats and when this was done they
set before them the service of wine. Anon appeared four troops
of singers with their instruments of music and each was composed
of five handmaids, so the whole numbered a score and these when
they appeared before the master kissed ground between his hands
and sat down each one in her own degree. Then amongst them
the cups went about and all sorrow was put to rout and the birds
of joyance flapped their wings. This continued for an hour of
time whilst the guests sat listening to the performers on the lute
and other instruments and after there came forward five damsels
other than the first twenty and formed a second and separate set
and they showed their art of singing in wondrous mode even as
was done by the first troop. Presently on like guise came set after
set till the whole twenty had performed and as Al-Rashid heard
their strains he shook with pleasure——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that when Al-Rashid
heard their strains, he shook with pleasure and wonder and joyance
and enjoyment until he rent his robes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7218" id="noteref-7218" epub:type="noteref">7218</a> and the house-master
beholding this said to him, “O our lord, be the heart of thine
enemies thus rended asunder!” Now there was amongst the
handmaids a songstress who began to sing and to improvise these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My world goes strait when thou art a-gone ✿ And when fled from my ken in my heart dost wone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7219" id="noteref-7219" epub:type="noteref">7219</a></div>
      <div class="line">And I love my love with a love as fond ✿ As Jacob him who in pit was thrown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereupon Ja’afar was delighted with exceeding delight and rent
his raiment even as the Caliph had done, but when the house-master
saw this from him he ordered for the twain a suit of
clothes that befitted them and bade strip them of the rended
garments and clothed them in the new. Presently the young
man said, “O my lords, your time is gleesome and Allah make it
to you gladsome and broaden your hearts and from you fend
everything loathsome and lasting to you be honour and all that
is blithesome.” Hereupon he ordered another damsel to chaunt
that was with her and when Masrur the Eunuch heard it he tare
his garment as had been done by Al-Rashid and the Wazir, when
the house-master bade bring for him a suit that besitted him and
they donned it after doffing the torn clothes. Then the youth
ordered a handmaid of the fourth set who sang a tune and spake
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou hast a lover of looks lune-bright ✿ And lighter than crescent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7220" id="noteref-7220" epub:type="noteref">7220</a> he shows to sight;</div>
      <div class="line">For the sheen of the crescent shall ever wane ✿ But he shall grow to a perfect light.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7221" id="noteref-7221" epub:type="noteref">7221</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hearing this Manjab the master of the house shrieked out a
mighty loud shriek and tare his upper dress and fell aswoon to the
ground, and as Al-Rashid looked upon him (and he bestrown in
his fainting fit) he beheld upon his sides the stripes of scourging
with rods and palm-sticks. At this sight he was surprised and
said, “O Ja’afar, verily I marvel at this youth and his generosity
and munificence and fine manners, especially when I look upon
that which hath befallen him of beating and bastinadoing, and in
good sooth this is a wondrous matter.” Quoth the other, “O our
lord, haply someone hath harmed him in much money and his enemy
took flight and the owner of the property administered to him this
beating<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7222" id="noteref-7222" epub:type="noteref">7222</a> or peradventure someone lied concerning him, and he
fell into the hands of the rulers and the Sultan bade bastinado
him, or again perchance his tongue tripped and his fate was fulfilled
to him.” Quoth Al-Rashid, “O Ja’afar, this youth be not
in the conditions thou hast mentioned to me,” and, replied the
other, “Sooth thou hast said, O our lord; by cause that indeed
this young man, when we asked him for a gugglet of water invited
us into his place and honoured us with all this honour and
heartened our hearts and this was of the stress of his generosity
and his abundant goodness.” Al-Rashid continued to converse
with his Wazir while the young man did not recover from his
swoon for a while of time, when another maiden of the maidens
spoke out reciting these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“He adorns the branch of his tribal-tree, ✿ Loves the fawn his song as his sight she see;</div>
      <div class="line">And beauty shines in his every limb ✿ While in every heart he must stablished be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereat the young man came to himself and shrieked a mighty
loud shriek more violent than the first and put forth his hand to
his garment and rent it in rags and fell swooning a second time,
when his sides were bared more fully than before until the whole
of his back appeared and Al-Rashid was straitened thereby as to
his breast and his patience made protest, and he cried, “O Ja’afar,
there is no help but that I ask concerning the wheals of this
bastinadoing.” And as they talked over the matter of the youth
behold, he came to his senses and his slaves brought him a fresh
suit and caused him don it, whereupon Al-Rashid came forward
and said, “O young man, thou hast honoured us and favoured us
and entreated us with such kindness as other than thyself could
never do nor can any requite us with the like; withal there
remaineth a somewhat in my heart”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Rashid
said to the youth, the master of the house, “Withal there remaineth
a somewhat in my heart which if I manifest not to thee will abide
there to my displeasure in my thought; and, albeit there is nothing
to equal that thou hast done with us, still I desire of thee and of
the excellence of thy kindness a fulfilling of thy favour.” Said
the youth, “What dost thou wish of me, ho thou the lord?”
and said the Caliph, “I would have thee inform me concerning
the scars upon thy sides and let me know for what cause they be
there.” Now when the young man heard these words he bowed
his brow groundwards and wept awhile, then he wiped his face and
raised his head and asked, “What hath urged you to this? But
the fault is from me and I merit a penalty even greater. O sons
of impurity, say me have you not read the lines written over the
doors of my house that here you are speaking of what concerneth
you not and so right soon shall ye hear what pleaseth you not?
However, had ye never entered my house you would not have
known of my case and my shame,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7223" id="noteref-7223" epub:type="noteref">7223</a> and withal sooth spoke he who
said amongst his many sayings:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“We sowed kindness-seed but they wrought us wrong ✿ Which is caitiff-work and a traitor-deed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Resumed the young man, “O vilest of folk, you asked of me a
gugglet of water, and I brought you into my house and honoured
and welcomed you and you ate of my victual and my salt, after
which I led you into my Harem with the fancy that ye were honest
men and behold you are no men. Woe to you, what may ye be?”
On this wise he continued to chide and revile them unknowing
that the Caliph Harun al-Rashid stood before him, and presently
the Prince of True Believers made reply, “We be folk of
Bassorah.” “Truth you have spoken,” cried the other, “nothing
cometh from Bassorah save the meanest of men and the weakest
of wits but now rise up, O ye dung<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7224" id="noteref-7224" epub:type="noteref">7224</a> of mankind, O ye foulest of
folk, and go forth from us and may Allah curse him who speaketh
of whatso concerneth him not.” All this and Ja’afar and Masrur
rose to their feet for shame of the youth and of what they had
heard from him of ill language and they went from beside him.
But Al-Rashid’s temper was ruffled and his jugulars swelled and
the Hashimi vein stood out between his eyes and he cried, “Woe
to thee, O Ja’afar! go this moment to Such-an-one the Wali and
bid him muster his men of whom each one must have in hand an
implement of iron, and let him repair to the mansion of this youth
and raze it till it return to be level with the ground, nor let
the morning dawn and show a trace thereof upon the face of
earth.” Quoth Ja’afar to Al-Rashid, “O Prince of True Believers,
from the very first we feared for all this, and did we not make
condition on the subject? However, O our lord, the good man is
not ruined by the good man and this work is not righteous; nay,
’tis wholly unright and one of the sages hath said:—The mild in
mind is not known save in the hour of wrath. But, O Prince of
faithful men and O Caliph of the Lord who the worlds dost vicereign,
thou swarest an oath that although the vilest of men should
ill-speak thee yet wouldest thou not requite him with evil, nor
return him aught of reply nor keep aught of rancour in thy heart
for his unmannerly address. Moreover, O our lord, the youth hath
no default at all and the offence is from us, for that he forbade
and forefended us and wrote up in many a place the warning
words, Whoso speaketh of what concerneth him not, shall hear
what pleaseth him not. Therefore he unmeriteth the pain of
death. Now what we had better do in this case is as follows:—Send
thou for the Wali and bid him bring the youth and when he
is present between thy hands, encounter him with kindness that his
fear may find rest and his affright be arrested after which he shall
inform thee of whatso befel him.” Cried Al-Rashid, “This is the
right rede and Allah requite thee with weal, O Ja’afar. ’Tis the
like of thee should be Wazir of the Councillors and Counseller of
the Kings.” Hereupon Harun al-Rashid returned to his palace in
company with Masrur the eunuch, and they entered the aforesaid
private door whereby they had gone forth, nor was any aware of
them. But when Ja’afar reached his abode he took thought in his
mind as to how he should act and how he should send the Wali
to the young man and bring him into the presence; and presently
he retraced his way afoot and going to the Chief of Police
acquainted him with the matter of the youth and carefully
described his house and said to him, “Needs must thou bring him
to us in the front of morning, but do thou be courteous in thy
dealing and show him comradeship and startle him not nor cause
him aught of fear.” After this Ja’afar dismissed the Wali and
returned to his own quarters. And when the morning morrowed
the Chief of Police having chosen him as escort a single Mameluke,
made for the house of the youth, and when he had reached it
knocked at the door, upon which the owner came out to him and
the Wali knew him by the description wherewith Ja’afar had
described him, so he bade him accompany him. Hereat the heart
of the young man fluttered.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.”

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth’s
heart fluttered when the Chief of Police summoned him to go in
his company and he was smitten by sore fear; but the Wali said
to him, “No harm shall befal thee: obey the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful.” Now when he heard these words
Manjab was terrified with sorer alarm and affright, so by leave of
the Wali he entered his house and farewelled his family and
familiars after which he fared forth with the Chief of Police saying,
“Hearkening and obedience to Allah and to the Prince of True
Believers.” Then he mounted his beast and the two rode together
until they reached the Palace of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid where
they craved admission to the presence; and, when leave was
granted, the youth went in and standing between the hands of
Harun he encouraged his intent and made his tongue eloquent
and kissed ground between the royal hands and sat respectfully
before him. Then he began with a tongue that was free of fear
and showed naught of apprehension and spake the following
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Hail to this place for such be honoured stead ✿ Of God’s viceregent known to all and some:</div>
      <div class="line">Palace of Al-Rashid, our lord, which aye ✿ Excelleth Heaven higher still become:</div>
      <div class="line">I haste that may I write what should be writ ✿ And eloquent the writ albe ’tis dumb.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After which he said, “The peace be upon thee, O Commander
of the Faithful, and Allah prolong thy life and gladden unto thee
what He hath given.” Hereat Al-Rashid raised his head, and
returning his greeting signed to the Wazir Ja’afar who, as was his
wont, stood by his side, and the Minister taking the youth’s hand,
led him up to Al-Rashid and seated him beside him. “Draw
near me,” said Harun al-Rashid, and the young man did accordingly
until he was close to the King who thus addressed him, “O young
man, what is thy name?” The other replied, “I am Manjab hight
wherefrom hath been cut off all cause of delight and who for a year
hath suffered parlous plight.” “O Manjab,” quoth the Caliph,
“favour for favour and the beginner is the better, and ill for ill
and the first is the worst, and whoso seed of good soweth shall reap
it, and whoso planteth evil shall harvest it, and know thou,
O Manjab, that yesterday we were thy guests, and that in thee was
no default, but we transgressed against thee when thou honouredst
us with most high honour, and favouredst us with the highmost
favours. I desire, however, that thou relate to me the cause of
the blows upon thy body and no harm shall befal thee.” The
youth replied, “O Prince of True Believers, an thou desire to hear
my tale order me a cushion to be placed on my right hand, and
deign lend unto me three things, to wit, thine ears and thine eyes
and thy heart, for verily my adventure is wondrous, and were it
graven with needle-gravers on the eye-corners it would be a warning
to whoso would be warned and a matter of thought to whoso
would think. Learn, O Commander of the Faithful, that my father
was a jeweller man, a connoisseur in gems, who owned no son save
myself; but when I had increased in age and had grown in stature
and Allah had given me comeliness and perfection and beauty and
brilliancy and plenty and good fortune, and my sire had brought
me up with the best of education, Allah vouchsafed to him a
daughter. Now as I had reached the age of twenty years my
parent departed to the ruth of Allah Almighty, bequeathing to me
a thousand thousand dinars and fiefs and tenements and landed
estates, so I let perform for him a sufficiency of mortuary-ceremonies
after committing him to mother earth, and caused read
twenty perfections of the Koran, and bestowed for him in alms a
mighty matter. I abode a-mourning for him a month full told, and
when the term was ended my heart turned to diversion and disport
and eating and drinking, and I made presents and gave away and
doled charities of that my property, and I bought other tenements
at the highest price. After this I purchased me singing damsels
of the greatest value, and whosoever of my friends and companions
was pleased with a musician girl I would hand her over to him
without price; nay, I would present her in free gift, and if any saw
aught of my belongings which pleased him and said to me, “This
is nice,” I would bestow it upon him without money-claim.
Furthermore I robed all my familiars in honourable robes, and
honoured them with the highest honour, lavishing all that was by
me, and whatever my hand possessed, ever quoting these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Rise, O comrade of cup, and to joy incline; ✿ I’ve no patience, O brother, from pressing of wine:</div>
      <div class="line">See’st not how night with her hosts be fled ✿ Routed, and morn doth her troops align?</div>
      <div class="line">How with Nadd and ambergris, rarest scents, ✿ Rose laughs and smiles on us Eglantine?</div>
      <div class="line">This, my lord, is joy, this is pure delight, ✿ Not standing at doors which the books confine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But when my mother, O Commander of the Faithful, espied these
doings she reproached me, yet would I not be reproved. Then she
saw that my wealth would be wasted, so she divided it between me
and her, to each one half, a moiety for herself and her daughter,
and the rest for myself. And presently she left me carrying away
her good and separated herself from me, abiding afar and leaving
me to enjoy my frivolity and intoxication. I ceased not eating
and drinking and diversion and disport, and enjoying the all-conquering
faces of the beautiful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7225" id="noteref-7225" epub:type="noteref">7225</a> until the days smote me with their
shafts, and all my wealth fell away from me and naught remained
to me either above me or below me, and I ceased to be master of
aught. Then my condition waxed strait, and as nothing was left
to me at home I sold the pots and pans until I lacked even a
sleeping-mat, and I used to patch my skirt with my sleeve. And
naught profited me, neither friend nor familiar nor lover, nor
remained there any one of them to feed me with a loaf of bread;
so my case became hard and the folk entreated me evilly, nor was
there one of my comrades or compeers who would take thought
for me; nay more, when I met any of them on the road or at
the receptions they would turn away their faces from me. So at
last I took to pulling up the slabs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7226" id="noteref-7226" epub:type="noteref">7226</a> of the house floor and selling
them by way of a livelihood, and one day as I did on this wise, lo and
behold! there opened in the floor a large vault whereinto I descended.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable.” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night an the
King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Fortieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
Manjab continued his tale to Al-Rashid in these words. So I
descended into the vault, O Commander of the Faithful, and
I found there three boxes each containing five bags and every bag
held five thousand gold pieces. I carried forth the whole of them
and set them in an apartment of the apartments and returned the
flag of the floor to its place. Then I pondered what my brethren
and companions had done with me, after which, O Prince of True
Believers, I bought handsome clothes and made my person as it
was before; and as soon as those men who were with me of yore and
upon whom I had spent my substance in gifts and presents beheld
me on such wise they flocked around me again. I accepted of them
for a device which I purposed carrying out and took patience with
them for a whole month whilst they came to visit me every day.
But when it was the thirty-first day I summoned the Kazi and
his assessors whom I concealed in a private place and bade write
a bond and an acceptance for everything they might hear from my
familiars and friends. After this I spread a feast and assembled
all my associates; and when we had eaten and drunken and made
merry, I drew them on to talk and to each and every whom I had
gifted with a present I said, “Allah upon thee, O Such-an-one,
did I not donate to thee so-and-so without taking any return from
thee?” And they replied “Yes, thou gavest it to me for naught.”
I continued, O Prince of True Believers, to address each and all
after this fashion whilst the Kazi and witnesses wrote down against
them everything they heard from them and documented every word
until not one of my friends remained without confession. Then,
O Commander of the Faithful, I rose to my feet without delay and
ere anyone could leave the assembly I brought out the Kazi and
his assessors and showed them the writ in the name of everyone,
specifying whatso he had received from the youth Manjab. After
this manner I redeemed all they had taken from me and my hand
was again in possession thereof, and I waxed sound of frame and
my good case returned to me as it had been. Now one day of
the days I took thought in my mind, O Prince of True Believers,
that I could open the shop of my sire and I would sit in it as my
parent was wont to do, selling and buying in sumptuous Hindi
cloths and jewelry and precious metals. Accordingly I repaired
to the place, which I found fast locked and the spider had pitched
her web-tent about it; so I hired a man to wipe it and sweep it
clean of all that was therein. And when the Bazar folk and the
merchants and the masters of shops saw me they rejoiced in me
and came to congratulate me saying, “Praise be to Allah who
opened not the store save for the owner thereof in succession to
his sire.” Then I took of merchandise a mighty matter and my
shop became one whose like was not to be looked upon throughout
the market-street, and amongst the goods I laid in were
carnelians of Al-Yaman; after which I seated me upon my shop-board
that very day and sold and bought and took and gave, and
I ceased not to be after such wise for nine days. Now when
it was the tenth day I entered the Hammam and came out after
donning a dress which was worth one thousand gold pieces, and my
beauty was increased and my colour waxed sheeny-bright and my
youth looked as though it had been redoubled, and I was not such
but that the women were like to throw themselves upon me. However,
when I returned from the Baths and sat in my store for an hour
or so behold, I heard a shout that came from the depths of the Bazar
and heard one saying, “Have patience,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7227" id="noteref-7227" epub:type="noteref">7227</a> when suddenly I looked
up and saw a stare-coloured mule whereon was a saddle of gold
dubbed with pearls and gems, and upon it an old woman was
riding accompanied by three pages. She ceased not going till she
stood at my shop-door where she drew rein and her servants
halted with her. Then she salam’d to me and said, “How long
is’t since thou hast opened this store?” and said I, “This day is
the full tenth.” Quoth she, “Allah have ruth upon the owner of
this shop, for he was indeed a merchant.” Quoth I, “He was my
parent,” and replied she, “Thou art Manjab named and as uniter
of thy friends enfamed.” Said I, “Yes!” whereat she smiled and
questioned me, “And how is thy sister, and what is the condition
of thy mother, and what is the state of thy neighbours?” “They
are all well,” said I, when said she, “O my son, O Manjab, thou
hast grown up and reached man’s estate.” Rejoined I, “Whoso
liveth groweth up;” and she continued, “Say me hast thou a
necklace of gems which is pleasing to the sight?” I responded,
“With me in the shop are many necklaces but I have better at
home and I will bring them for thee betimes to-morrow if it be
the will of Almighty Allah.” When she heard these my words she
returned by the way she came and her pages walked by her side;
and at the end of the day I went to my mother and informed her
of the adventure how it was with the old woman and she said,
“O my son, O Manjab, verily that ancient dame is a confidential
nurse and she conferreth benefits upon the folk amongst whom
was thy sire before thee: therefore do thou be urgent in bringing
about her business nor do thou forgo thine appointment with her.”
The old woman disappeared for a day; but on the next she
returned in her wonted state and when she came to my shop she
said, “O Manjab, arise and mount thy mule, in weal and good
health!” So I left my store and mounted my she-mule—And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you in the coming night an the
Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
Manjab said to the Prince of True Believers:—So I mounted
my she-mule and I went with the old woman until I came to a
mansion built of stone and wide of gates; so we dismounted, I and
she, and entered the door, I following after her until we came to
the great hall. There I found, O Prince of True Believers, carpets
of fine silk and embroidered hangings and mattresses of gold-cloth
and vases of the same kind all golden and fine brocades and jars
of porcelain and shelves of crystal; in fine I saw things which I
may not describe to thee, O Commander of the Faithful. And at
the side of the mansion within were four bench-seats of yellow
brass, plain and without carving and the old woman seated me
upon the highest mattress and she pointed out to me a porch
where stood pourtrayed all manner birds and beasts, and hills
and channels were limned. Now as I cast my eye over these
paintings suddenly a young lady accosted us speaking with a
delicate voice demure and words that the sick and sorry would
cure and she was behind a hanging and saying, “Whoso hath let
down this curtain let him receive one hundred stripes.” Then she
bade withdraw it and they removed it and behold, I felt as though
the lightning were gleaming and glittering and it took away my
sight until my head was near striking the ground, for there stood
before me a young lady of lance-like stature and a face like the
morning bright as though she were a chandelier a-hanging amid
the cressets. She was dressed in sumptuous raiment and was even
as said of her the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“To us she bent whenas Night hung her veil ✿ And nigh went she my sense to turn from right;</div>
      <div class="line">And rang her anklets and her necklace chimed ✿ With dainty music to my tearful plight.</div>
      <div class="line">Showèd me that her face a four-fold charm, ✿ Water and fire and pitch and lamping light.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, O Commander of the Faithful, she cried out to the slave
girls, “Woe to you, where is the Nurse,” and when she was fetched
between her hands she asked her, “Hast thou brought the
jeweller;” and the other answered, “Yea, verily, O lady of loveliness,
and here he is sitting like the full moon when it easteth.”
The young lady cried, “O old woman, is this he or is it his servant?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7228" id="noteref-7228" epub:type="noteref">7228</a>
Whereto she replied, “No, ’tis he himself, O lady of loveliness.”
Quoth the other, “By the life of my youth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7229" id="noteref-7229" epub:type="noteref">7229</a> thou deservest
naught for this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7230" id="noteref-7230" epub:type="noteref">7230</a> save whatso thou fanciest not and thou hast
raised me from before my food<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7231" id="noteref-7231" epub:type="noteref">7231</a> while yet I fancied that he merited
rising up to him.” Then she considered me and cried, “Am I then
in this fashion become<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7232" id="noteref-7232" epub:type="noteref">7232</a> a bundle of dirty clothes all of poverty,
and say me now, hast thou not even washed thy face?” But I, O
Prince of True Believers, was still as I came forth from the Hammam
and my countenance was shining like unto lightning. Hereat I
made myself exceeding small and it mortified me to hear how she
had found fault with my face and befouled my dress, scorning me
till I became between her hands smaller than the very smallest.
Then she fixed her sight upon me and she said to me, “Thou art
Manjab hight, thou dogs’ trysting-site or gatherer of friends as
saith other wight, but by Allah how far be familiars and friends from
thy sight, O thou Manjab hight! Now, however, do thou look
upon me, O Jeweller man, the while I eat and when my meal shall
end there will be talk.” Hereupon, O Commander of the Faithful,
they brought her a crystal platter in a golden basin and therein
were the thighs of fowls; so she took seat before me and fell to
eating without shyness or difficulty as though in her presence I
were other than a son of Adam. And I stood looking at her
and whenever she raised her wrist to take up a morsel, the dimple<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7233" id="noteref-7233" epub:type="noteref">7233</a>
became manifest from without, and upon the skin was a tattoo of
green colour and about it jewelled ornaments<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7234" id="noteref-7234" epub:type="noteref">7234</a> and armlets of red
gold and a pink dye appeared upon the whiteness of her hand: so
glory be to Him who created her and she was naught but a
seduction to whoso espied her and blessed be Allah the best of
Creators. May the Almighty have ruth upon the poet who said
concerning the beauty of his lover these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Rise and pass me the wine, O thou son of Mansúr; ✿ And for stopping it hope not my pardon forsure:</div>
      <div class="line">Let it come by the hand of a fair white maid ✿ As though she had fared from the Heav’n of the Húr:</div>
      <div class="line">When we see the figure her wrist adorns ✿ ’Tis a musk grain lying on limestone pure.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, O Prince of True Believers, she fell to conversing with me
hending in hand a broidered kerchief wherewith whenever she had
eaten a morsel she wiped her lips and when her sleeve fell from
off her wrist she tucked it up even as the poet said of such:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“She hideth her face from the folk, ✿ With a wrist whereon Ottars abound;</div>
      <div class="line">And to eye of watcher it seems ✿ Gold shaft on Moon’s silvern round.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when she had eaten, O Commander of the Faithful, I gazed
at her face and she cried, “O ye women, behold how Manjab
looketh upon me and I am eating till my nature cry enough;”
presently adding, “O Manjab, what calamity hath befallen thee
that thou comest not forward and eatest not of this food?” So I
drew anigh and ate with her, but I was dazed of my wits and sore
amazed at her ways.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night, an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that Manjab
continued to the Caliph:—Verily I came forward and ate with
her, but I was so dazed of my wits and so sore amazed at her
beauty and loveliness that as I took up a mouthful to carry it to
my mouth behold, I would carry it to my eyes in consequence of
what befel me from seeing that was in this young lady. And
presently she fell to laughing at me and inclining towards me in
her haughtiness and in beauty’s pride, saying at the same time,
“By Allah, indeed this man is a maniac and a Bahlúl:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7235" id="noteref-7235" epub:type="noteref">7235</a> where is
thy mouth and how far from thine eye?” So said I, “By Allah,
O lady of loveliness, I am nor a madman nor a Bahlúl, but whilst
looking at thy beauty my wits have fled and I am in condition of
unknowing how I ate.” Then she asked me, “Do I please thee,
O Manjab?” and I answered her “Yes! Walláhi, O my lady,
indeed thou dost.” Quoth she, “What should be the penalty of
him who owning me and my white beauties<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7236" id="noteref-7236" epub:type="noteref">7236</a> shall then forsake me
to take other than myself?” and quoth I, “His award should be a
thousand stripes upon his right side and as many upon his left ribs,
together with the cutting off of his tongue and his two hands and
the plucking out of either eye.” She cried, “Wilt thou marry me
upon this condition?” and I replied, “O my lady, dost thou mock
and laugh at me?” Said she, “No, by Allah, my word is naught
save a true word;” and said I, “I am satisfied and I accept this
compact; however do thou make haste and delay not.” But
when she looked at me and heard mine intent regarding the
marriage she shook with joy and pride and she inclined towards
me as she sat before me and my senses were like to take flight.
Then she rose up and left me for an hour and came back dressed
in sumptuous garments and fairer than before, and perfumes reeked
from her sides as she walked between four handmaidens like unto
the refulgent moon. But I, when I looked upon her in this condition,
cried out with a loud outcry and fell fainting to the ground
for what befel me from her beauty and perfection: and she had
no design therein, O Commander of the Faithful, save her favour
for me. When I came to myself she said, “O Manjab, what dost
thou say of my beauty and comeliness?” and I replied, “By
Allah, O lady of loveliness, there is none in this time can be thy
peer.” Then quoth she, “An I please thee thou wilt be content
with these conditions?” whereto quoth I, “Content! <span class="sc">Content!!</span>
CONTENT!!!” Thereupon she bade summon the Kazi and the
assessors who came without stay or delay and she said to the Judge
“Do thou listen to the condition of this marriage and write from
his word of mouth a bond on oath and under penalty for breaking
it, to the effect that if he betray me and mate with other or by
way of right or of unright, I will smite him a thousand stripes on
his right side and as many on his left ribs and I will cut off his
tongue and his two hands and I will pluck out his either eye.”
Said the Kazi to me, “Shall we bear witness against thee with
this condition?” and when I answered “Yes,” he wrote out, O
Commander of the Faithful, his testimony together with the
penalty, while I hardly believed in all this. Presently, she brought
out a tray, whereupon were a thousand miskals of gold and a
thousand dirhams of silver which she scattered among the Kazi
and witnesses; so they took them and went their ways having
duly tied the marriage-knot and indited the penalty thereto
attached. Then they served up food and we ate and drank and I
lay with her that night in the pleasantest of nighting and the gladsomest
of living and I only desired that morning would never
appear for the stress of what befel me of joyance and delight;
and, verily, I never saw and never heard and never knew any
that was the like of her. So I abode with her, O Prince of True
Believers, for seven days which passed away as one watch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7237" id="noteref-7237" epub:type="noteref">7237</a> and on
the eighth she said to me, “O thou Manjab named and for friend
of friends enfamed, do thou take this purse wherein are a thousand
dinars and buy with it merchandise of necklaces and gems and fine
clothes wherewith to beautify thy shop and other things that befit
thee; for ’tis my will that thou become the greatest of men in the
Bazar and that none therein shall boast of more good than thyself.
Moreover ’tis my wish, O Manjab, that thou fare to thy store at early
dawn and return to me about noon-tide, lest my breast be straitened
by thine absence.” Replied I, “Hearkening and obedience;” but,
O Commander of the Faithful, it was mine intent and desire never to
fare forth from her, or by night or by day, from the stress of what
befel me of enjoyment with my bride. Now she was wont every
hour to go don a dress other than that which was upon her, and
when I saw her in that condition I could not contain my passion,
so I would arise and fulfil my need of her and she would do likewise.
Also, as soon as morn appeared I would repair to my shop
and open it and take seat therein until midday, at which time my
mule would be brought me to ride homewards when she would
meet me alone at the threshold whereupon opened the door of her
apartment. And I would throw my arms round her neck as soon as
she appeared to me till she and I entered the Harem where I had
no patience from her but was fain to enjoy my desire. After this
she would cry to her women and bid them bring us dinner whereof
I ate with her, and in due time she would arise and command
her slave-girls to clean the Hammam and perfume it with pastiles
of lign-aloes and ambergris adding a sufficiency of rosewater.
Then we would enter it, I and she, and doff our dresses when I
again lost patience until I had my will of her twice or three
times.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7238" id="noteref-7238" epub:type="noteref">7238</a> Anon we would wash and wipe ourselves with apron
napkins of thick silk and drying towels of palm-fibre, after which
she would cry aloud to the women who, coming to us at her call,
would bring sherberts and we would drink, I and she, until mid-afternoon.
Then I would mount my she-mule and return to my
store and as evening fell I would order the slave to padlock the
door and I would return to my house. Now I abode in such case
for ten months, but it fortuned one day of the days that, as I was
sitting upon my shop-board, suddenly I saw a Badawi woman
bestriding a she-dromedary and she was marked with a Burka’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7239" id="noteref-7239" epub:type="noteref">7239</a> of
brocade and her eyes danced under her face-veil as though they
were the wantoning eyes of a gazelle. When I looked upon her, O
Commander of the Faithful, I was perplexed as to my affair.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming

    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-fifth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth
Manjab to the Caliph:—O Prince of True Believers, when I
beheld the eyes of the Badawi woman under her Burka’ which
were like those of a gazelle they tempted my passions hereto and
I forgot my oath and its penalty and the Kazi and witnesses.
Then she approached me and said, “Allah give thee long life, O
Chief of the Arabs;” and said I, “To thee too, O most seemly of
semblance!” Cried she, “O comely of countenance, say me,
hast thou a necklace fine enough for the like of me;” whereto I
rejoined, “Yes.” Then I arose and brought out one to her, but
she seeing it said, “Hast thou naught better than this?” So I
displayed to her, O Commander of the Faithful, all the necklaces
I had by me in the shop but, none of them pleasing her, I said,
“In all the stores there is naught finer than these.” Then, O
Prince of True Believers, she brought out to me from off her neck
a carcanet and said, “I want one such;” and, as I looked upon it,
I knew that there was nothing like it in my store, and that all I
had by me of collars and jewels and other goods were not worth
a single grain of that carcanet. So I said to her, “O Winsome of
Eyes, this is a thing whereto none of this time can avail save it be
with the Commander of the Faithful or with his Wazir Ja’afar bin
Yahyá the Barmaki.” Quoth she, “Wilt thou buy it of me?”
and quoth I, “I have no power to its price,” when she exclaimed,
“I require no payment for this necklace, and I want from thee
nothing save a kiss upon thy cheek.” Then said I, “O Lady of
loveliness, bussing without treading I trow is like a bowyer
sans a bow,” and she replied, “Whoso kisseth surely treadeth.”
Then, O Prince of True Believers, she sprang from off her
dromedary and seated herself beside me within my store, so I
arose with her and went into the inner room, she following me
(albeit I expected not this from her), and when we were safely
inside she clasped me to her bosom and encountered me with her
breasts never withal withdrawing her veil from her face. Hereat
I lost all power over my senses and when I felt her strain me to
her bosom I also strained her to mine, and fulfilled of her my
desire after the fairest fashion. And when this was done she
sprang to her feet even as springeth the lion from his lair, and
flying to the door of the shop swiftlier than a bird and leaving the
necklace with me, she mounted her dromedary and went her
ways. I imagined, O Prince of True Believers, that she would never
return to me at all; so my heart rejoiced in the necklace which
she had left and I was of that fancy and opinion anent the matter
and manner of her going, when suddenly my pages brought me
the she-mule, and said to me, “O our lord, rise up and fare to
the house, for that our lady hath required thee at this very hour
and she hath caused dinner to be served and sore we fear lest
it wax cold.” Therefore, O Commander of the Faithful, I found
it impossible to bathe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7240" id="noteref-7240" epub:type="noteref">7240</a> by reason of the pages which were
standing with the mule at the door of my shop; so I mounted
and rode home. I entered my house according to my usual habit
when my wife met me and said to me “O my dearling, my
heart hath been occupied with thee this day, for thou has tarried
away from me so long a time and contrary to thy custom is
delaying on such a day as this.” Said I, “This morning the
Bazar was crowded exceedingly and all the merchants were
sitting in their shops, nor was it possible for me to rise from my
store whilst the market was so warm.” Quoth she, “O my
dearling and coolth of mine eyes, I was at this moment sitting
and reading in the Sublime Volume when there befel me a doubt
concerning a word in the chapter ’Yá Sín’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7241" id="noteref-7241" epub:type="noteref">7241</a> and I desire that
thou certify it to me that I may learn it by heart from thee.”
Quoth I, “O lady of loveliness, I am unable to touch The Book
much less may I read the Koran;” and quoth she, “What is the
cause of that?” Replied I, “I was sleeping at the side of my shop
when I had a polluting dream;” and she rejoined, “An this thy
speech be sooth-fast thy bag-trowsers must be fouled, so draw
them off that I may see to their washing.” I retorted, “Indeed
my trowsers are not bewrayed because I doffed them before lying
down to sleep.” Now when she heard these my words, O Commander
of the Faithful, she said to a slave of my slaves whose
name was Rayhán, “O man, go and open the shop and bring the
kerchief that is therein.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7242" id="noteref-7242" epub:type="noteref">7242</a> Then said I, “O lady of lovelings, I
presented it in alms-gift to an old woman who was naked of head
and her condition pained me and her poverty, so I largessed it to
her.” Rejoined she, “Say me, was the old woman she who was
mounted on the dromedary, the owner of the valuable necklace
which she sold to thee for a kiss when thou saidst to her:—O
Winsome of Eyes, bussing without treading I trow, is as a
bowyer sans bow.” Now when her words were ended, O Commander
of the Faithful, she turned to her women and cried to
them, “Bring hither this moment Sa’ídíyah, the kitchen-wench,”
and when she came between her hands behold, she was a slave-girl,
a negress, and she was the same in species and substance
who came to me under the form of a Badawi woman with a face-veil
of brocade covering her features. Hereupon my wife drew
the Burka’ from before the woman’s face and caused her doff
her dress, and when she was stripped she was black as a bit
of charcoal. Now as soon as I saw this, O Viceregent of Allah,
my wits were bewildered and I considered my affair and I knew
not what to do, thinking of the conditions whereto I had consented——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab
continued:—And I thought of the conditions whereto I had
consented and the penalty which had been written for me by the
Kazi in the presence of his assessors, so I wandered from my right
mind when she looked at me and said, “Is this our compact,
O Manjab hight, thou dogs’ trysting-site?” and when I heard her
speech, O Commander of the Faithful, I hanged my head groundwards
and could not return a reply, nor even attempt to address
her could I. Said she, “Woe to thee, did I not say to thee:—O
Manjab hight, thou who with curs dost unite and no foregatherer
with friendly wight? Woe to thee, and he lied not who
said that in men-kind there be no trust. But how, O Manjab,
didst thou prefer this slave-girl before me and make her my equal
in dress and semblance? However, O ye women, do ye send and
bring the Kazi and the assessors at this moment and instant.”
So they fetched them without stay or delay, and they produced
the obligation which had been written, with the penalty duly
attested by testimony. Then she said to the witnesses, “Read
all that for him,” and they did so and asked me, “What hast
thou to say about this obligation and the punishment for breaking
it?” Answered I, “The document is right and fair, nor have I
aught to utter thereanent.” Hereupon, O Prince of True Believers,
she summoned the Governor and his officials, and I confessed
before them and bore witness against myself, when they reviled
me and abused me, and I told them the tale full and complete.
But they would not excuse me and they all cried, “Verily, thou
deservest splitting or quartering;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7243" id="noteref-7243" epub:type="noteref">7243</a> thou who wouldst abandon this
beauty and perfection and brilliancy and stature and symmetry
and wouldst throw thyself upon a slave-girl black as charcoal;
thou who wouldst leave this semblance which is like the splendours
of moonlight and wouldst follow yon fulsome figure which
resembleth the murks of night.” Hereupon, O Prince of True
Believers, she said to the Governor, “Hearken unto what I tell
thee. I bear witness against myself that I have excused him the
cutting off his hand and tongue and the plucking out his eyes;
but do ye redeem my rights of him by one condition.” “And
what may that be?” asked they; and she answered, “A thousand
stripes upon his right side, and as many upon his left ribs.” Hereupon,
O Commander of the Faithful, they seized me and smote
me upon my right flank until I was estranged from the world,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7244" id="noteref-7244" epub:type="noteref">7244</a>
and after they took a handful of salt, which they rubbed upon
the wounds.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7245" id="noteref-7245" epub:type="noteref">7245</a> Then they applied a thousand stripes to my left
ribs, and threw over me a ragged robe wherewith to veil my
shame. But my flanks had been torn open by such a bastinado,
nor did I recover for a space of three days, when I found myself
lying cast-out upon a dunghill. Seeing this my condition, I
pulled myself together, and arising walked to the mansion wherein
I was wont to wone; but I found the door locked with three
padlocks and it was empty and void, nor was voice or sound to be
heard therein at all, and ’twas, as said one of the poets in this
couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The chambers were like a beehive well stocked; when the bees quitted them they became empty.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7246" id="noteref-7246" epub:type="noteref">7246</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So I lingered there an hour of time, when a woman suddenly came
out from one of the neighbouring houses and asked me, “What
dost thou want, O asker; and what seekest thou?” I answered,
“We are in quest of the owners of this mansion;” and said she,
“Here they were in crowds and then they abandoned it, and may
Allah have mercy upon him who spake these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“They fared and with faring fled rest from me ✿ And my parted heart no repose can see:</div>
      <div class="line">Have ruth on a wight with a heart weighed by woes ✿ Seest not how their door is without a key?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then indeed I repented, O Commander of the Faithful, over that
I had done and regretted what had befallen me and what had
proceeded from me of ill-deeds, and quoth I to the woman who
had addressed me, “Allah upon thee, O my mistress, say me,
hast thou of their traces any tidings?”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent, and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab,
speaking to the woman, said, “O my lady; say me, dost thou
know of their traces any tidings, and hast thou come upon any
manifest news?” Said she, “This thing was to befal thee of old,
O thou poor fellow, even as quoth the poet in the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My tears flow fast, my heart knows no rest ✿ And melts my soul and cares aye molest:</div>
      <div class="line">Would Heaven mine eyeballs their form beheld ✿ And flies my life, and ah! who shall arrest?</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis wondrous the while shows my form to sight, ✿ Fire burns my vitals with flamey crest!</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed for parting I’ve wept, and yet ✿ No friend I find to mine aid addrest:</div>
      <div class="line">Ho thou the Moon in a moment gone ✿ From sight, wilt thou rise to a glance so blest?</div>
      <div class="line">An thou be ’stranged of estrangement who ✿ Of men shall save me? Would God I wist!</div>
      <div class="line">Fate hath won the race in departing me ✿ And who with Fate can avail contest?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, O Commander of the Faithful, my longings grew and I
poured fast tears in torrents and I was like to choke with my
sobs, so I arose to walk about the city highways and I clung
from wall to wall for what befel me of despight and affright
at the disappearance of them,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7247" id="noteref-7247" epub:type="noteref">7247</a> and as I wandered about I repeated
these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“To man I’m humbled when my friends lost I ✿ And missed the way of right where hardships lie:</div>
      <div class="line">Sorrow and sickness long have been my lot ✿ To bear, when need was strong to justify:</div>
      <div class="line">Say me, shall any with their presence cheer— ✿ Pity my soul? Then bless my friend who’s nigh!</div>
      <div class="line">I kiss your footprints for the love of you, ✿ I greet your envoy e’en albeit he lie.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After this, O Prince of True Believers, I remained immersed in
cark and care and anxious thought, and as ever I wandered
about behold, a man met me and said, “’Tis now three days
since they marched away and none wotteth where they have
alighted.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7248" id="noteref-7248" epub:type="noteref">7248</a> So I returned once more to the mansion door and
I sat beside it to take my rest when my glance was raised and
fell upon the lintel and I saw attached to it a folded paper which
I hent in hand and found written therein these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Scant shall avail with judgement just the tear ✿ When at love-humbled heart man dareth jeer:</div>
      <div class="line">I was thy dearling, fain with thee to dwell ✿ But thou transgressedst nor return canst speer:</div>
      <div class="line">And if by every means thou find me not, ✿ From thee I fled and other hold I dear:</div>
      <div class="line">I come in dreams to see if sore thy heart; ✿ Let it take patience in its woe sincere:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou dost beweep our union fled, but I ✿ Wist that such weeping brings no profit clear:</div>
      <div class="line">Ho, stander at my door, once honoured guest, ✿ Haply my tidings thou some day shalt hear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon, O Commander of the Faithful, I returned to my
mother and sister and told them the tale of what had betided
me, first and last, and the twain wept over me and my parent
said, “I thought not, O my son, that such case as this would
come down upon thee; withal every calamity save Death is no
calamity at all; so be thou of long-suffering, O my child, for the
compensation of patience is upon Allah; and indeed this that
hath happened to thee hath happened unto many the likes of
thee, and know thou that Fate is effectual and Sort is sealed.
Hast thou not heard the words of the poet who spoke these
couplets:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7249" id="noteref-7249" epub:type="noteref">7249</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The world aye whirleth with its sweet and sour ✿ And Time aye trippeth with its joy and stowre:</div>
      <div class="line">Say him to whom life-change is wilful strange ✿ Right wilful is the world and risks aye low’r:</div>
      <div class="line">See’st now how Ocean overwhelms his marge ✿ And stores the pearl-drop in his deepest bow’r:</div>
      <div class="line">On Earth how many are of leafy trees, ✿ But none we harvest save what fruit and flow’r:</div>
      <div class="line">See’st not the storm-winds blowing fierce and wild ✿ Deign level nothing save the trees that tow’r?</div>
      <div class="line">In Heaven are stars and planets numberless ✿ But none save Sun and Moon eclipse endure.</div>
      <div class="line">Thou judgest well the days when Time runs fair ✿ Nor fearest trouble from Fate’s evil hour:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou wast deceived what time the Nights were fain, ✿ But in the bliss o’ nights ’ware days of bane.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when I heard these words of my mother, O Prince of True
Believers, and what she addressed to me of wise sayings and
poetry, I took patience and rendered account to Allah;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-ninth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab said,
“O Commander of the Faithful, I had patience and rendered my
account to Allah Almighty. Then my mother fell to nursing me,
with medicines and unguents and what not else of remedies wherefrom
cometh health until I was healed, yet there remained to me
the scars even as thou sawest. But I inscribed not those lines
upon my house which thou didst espy, O Commander of the
Faithful, save that the news thereof might reach thee, and that
naught be concealed from thee of my tidings and my past fate,
and present condition. And this is the whole that hath befallen
me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7250" id="noteref-7250" epub:type="noteref">7250</a> Now when the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard these words
he smote hand upon hand and cried, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious, the Great.” Then
he cried upon the Minister Ja’afar the Barmecide, and said to him,
“O Wazir, unless thou bring me information of this affair and root
out this matter and make manifest to me the condition of this
youth, verily I will smite thy neck.” The Minister answered,
“Hearing and obeying: however, do thou, O Commander of the
Faithful, give me three days’ delay,” and the Caliph rejoined, “I
have granted this to thee.” Hereupon Ja’afar went forth like unto
one blind and deaf, unseeing nor hearing aught, and he was perplext
and distraught as to his affair and continued saying, “Would
Heaven we had not forgathered with this youth, nor ever had seen
the sight of him.” And he ceased not faring till he arrived at his
own house, where he changed his dress and fell to threading the
thoroughfares of Baghdad, which in the time of Harun al-Rashid
was a mighty great city, and in every street he entered he sought
intelligence and questioned the folk concerning every affair which
had happened in town from dawn to dark, but he hit upon no
trace nor information manifest touching this matter. On the
second day it was the same, and nothing became known to him
between morning and evening; but on the third day as he fared
forth he repeated these words:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“With the King be familiar and ’ware his wrath ✿ Nor be wilful when cometh his order ’Do.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And he crossed and recrossed the city until it was noon-tide
without aught of novelty appearing to him, so he returned to
his mansion where he had a confidential nurse whom he apprised
of the tidings and, concealing naught from her said, “Verily the
term allowed to me by the King is until set of sun, at which time
unless I bring him the information required he will cut off my
head.” Thereupon the Kahramánah went forth and circled through
the city until it was mid-afternoon, but she brought back no fresh
tidings; whereat Ja’afar cried, “There is no Majesty and there is
no Might, save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!” Now the
Wazir had a sister who lived single in his home with her women
and eunuchs, and he said to himself, “I will go to my sister Budúr
and solace myself by conversing awhile with her and farewell
her: haply Fate is not afar.” This sister was yet unwedded
for none dared come forward and propose marriage to her, albeit
in the city of Baghdad not one was her peer in beauty, even
amongst the women of the Caliph. Accordingly he turned towards
her apartment and entered therein, when she met him upon the
threshold of the gate, and as she saw him changed of condition
she cried, “No harm to thee, O my brother, verily thou art altered
in case;” and he replied, “Indeed I have fallen into evil plight
and into a matter of affright, whereupon naught can deliver me
save the power of Allah of All-might, and unless the affair be made
evident to me by the morning the Caliph will cut off my head.”
Then he related to her the affair from beginning to end, and she,
when she heard the words of her brother, waxed wan of colour, and
was altered in case and said, “O brother mine, give me immunity
and a binding bond when I will explain to thee the matter of
this youth.” Hereat calmed was his affright, and his heart was
satisfied quite, and he gave her promise of safety and a binding
bond and contract not to harm her; whereupon said she to him,
“O my brother, womankind was created for mankind, and mankind
was created for womankind, and albe falsehood is an excuse,
yet soothfastness is more saving and safe-guiding. The whole of this
business is mine and I am she who married him and made with
him that condition which he accepted for himself, being contented
with the covenant and its penalty.” Now when Ja’afar heard these
words spoken to him by his sister concerning the case of Manjab,
he outwardly made merry but he inwardly mourned, for that he
had forbidden her to wed, and she had worked this craft and had
given herself away to wife. Hereupon he arose without stay or
delay and fared forth until he went in to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid
whom he blessed and greeted, and the King, having
returned his salam, asked him, “Hast thou brought to me the
required tidings, O Ja’afar?” The Wazir answered, “Yes, O my
lord, the news hath become manifest and ’tis certified to me that
this is a private matter; and had not the Creator favoured me by
forgathering with the young lady in her substance and accidence and
had I not met her at a term not appointed, I should have been done
to die.” Quoth the Caliph, “And who is she that I may requite her
for her deeds and for what she hath practised upon Manjab, who
verily deserveth not that which hath betided him, although he may
have been somewhat in fault.” Then Ja’afar came forward and craved
pardon from the Caliph in token of honour for his sister’s sake, and
quoth his lord, “O Ja’afar, thou hast declared that she it is with
whom thou hast forgathered.” Quoth Ja’afar, “O Prince of True
Believers, the same is my sister Budúr.” But when the Caliph
heard these words, he asked, “O Ja’afar, and why did thy sister
do such deed?” and the Wazir answered, “Whatso is fated shall
take place nor shall any defer the predestined nor forbid it when
decreed, nor hasten it when forbidden. This thing which hath
happened was of no profit to anyone and whatever thou shalt
ordain that shall be done.” Thereat Manjab after saluting the
Caliph, accompanied Ja’afar to the house of his sister, and when
they went in the Wazir made peace between the two, and the Caliph
largessed the youth with most sumptuous presents. Now the
Caliph every year at times appointed was accustomed to go by
night in disguise to the house of Manjab accompanied by Ja’afar
for the sake of hearing music, and one night of the nights he said
to the youth, “Alhamdolillah—Glory be to God—O Manjab, that I
have caused reunion between thee and Budúr, thy beloved; but I
desire that thou tell me some tale which shall be rare and shall
broaden my breast.” The youth replied, “Hearing and obeying,”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night, an the
King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,

of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King and
Caliph, Harun al-Rashid, bade the youth Manjab tell him some
tale of the Kings of old and he replied, “Hearkening and

recounting the</p>

<p class="c014">It is related (but Allah is All-knowing of hidden things and All-wise!)
that in the days of a King called Dahmár<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7251" id="noteref-7251" epub:type="noteref">7251</a> there was a
barber who had in his booth a boy for apprentice and one day
of the days there came in a Darwaysh man who took seat and
turning to the lad saw that he was a model of beauty and loveliness
and stature and symmetric grace. So he asked him for a
mirror and when it was brought he took it and considered his face
therein and combed his beard, after which he put hand in pouch
and pulling out an Ashrafi of gold set it upon the looking-glass
which he gave back to the boy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7252" id="noteref-7252" epub:type="noteref">7252</a> Hereupon the barber turned
towards the beggar and wondered in himself and said, “Praise be
to Allah, albeit this man be a Fakir yet he placeth a golden piece
upon the mirror, and surely this is a marvellous matter.” Hereupon
the Darwaysh went his ways, and on the following day he
suddenly made his appearance and entering the booth called for a
looking-glass from the barber’s prentice and when it was handed
to him combed his beard after he had looked at his features
therein; then, bringing forth an Ashrafi, he set it upon the mirror
and gave it back to the boy; and the barber marvelled yet the
more to see the Fakir rising up and wending his ways.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7253" id="noteref-7253" epub:type="noteref">7253</a> The
beggar ceased not coming every day and gazing at himself in the
glass and laying down his ducat, whereat the barber said to himself,
“By Allah, indeed this Darwaysh must have some object of
his own and haply he is in love with the lad my prentice and I
fear from the beggar lest he seduce the boy and take him away
from me.” Hereat he cried, “O boy, when the Darwaysh shall
come to thee draw thou not anear him; and when he demandeth
the looking-glass give it not to him; for I myself will do so.” On
the third day behold, the Fakir appeared according to his custom
and asked for the mirror from the boy who wittingly disregarded
him, whereupon he turned towards him and waxed wroth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7254" id="noteref-7254" epub:type="noteref">7254</a> and
was like to slay him. The apprentice was terrified at his rage
and gave him the looking-glass whilst he was still an-angered;
but when the man had reviewed himself therein and had combed
his beard and had finished his need, he brought out ten dinars of
gold and setting them upon the mirror handed them to the lad.
Seeing this the barber wondered anew with extreme wonderment,
saying to himself, “By Allah, this Darwaysh cometh daily and
layeth down an Ashrafi, but this day he hath given ten gold
pieces; withal there accrueth not to me from my shop even half
a piastre of daily wage. However, O Boy, when the man shall
come hither, as is his wont, do thou spread for him a prayer-rug
in the inner room of the shop, lest the people seeing his constant
visits should have ill suspicions of us.” “Yes!” said the lad.
So when it was the next day the Fakir came and went into the
ben whither he was shown by the boy, and he followed him till
they were in the innermost of the booth. Now the heart of
this Religious hung to the love of the barber’s boy for that he had
of beauty and perfection and he continued frequenting the shop
every day whilst the lad ceased not spreading the rug and
receiving upon the mirror ten Ashrafis. Hereat the barber and
his apprentice rejoiced till one day of the days when the
Darwaysh came to the shaving-shop, as was his wont, where he
met none but only the boy nor was there any other in sight. So
he asked concerning his employer and the other answered, “O
uncle, my master hath gone forth to solace himself with seeing
the casting of the cannon; for this day the Sultan and the Wazir
and the Lords of the land will all be present thereat.” Said he,
“O my son, go thou with us and we will also enjoy the spectacle
and return before the rest of the folk, ere thy master can be
back, and we will enjoy ourselves and make merry and look at
the sport before I set out upon my journey, for ’tis my intention
this day to go forth about noontide.” Quoth the lad, “’Tis well
O uncle;” and arising he locked the shop-door and walked with
the Darwaysh till they reached the spot where the cannon were
being cast. There they found the Sultan and the Wazirs and the
Chamberlains and the Lords of the land and the Grandees of the
realm all standing in a body until presently the workmen took the
crucibles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7255" id="noteref-7255" epub:type="noteref">7255</a> from off the fire. Now the first who went up to them
was the Sultan and he found them full of molten brass: so he
put his hand into his pocket and drew it forth full of gold which
he cast into the melting pots. Then the Grand Wazir walked
forward and did as the King had done and all the Notables who
were present threw cash into the crucibles, bar-silver and piastres
and dollars. Thereat the Darwaysh stepped out of the crowd
and brought from his cowl a reed used as an étui<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7256" id="noteref-7256" epub:type="noteref">7256</a> wherefrom he drew
a spoon-like ear-picker and cast into one of the crucibles a something
of powder like grain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7257" id="noteref-7257" epub:type="noteref">7257</a> This he did to each one of the melting
pots; after which he disappeared from the eyes of the folk and
taking the boy with him returned to the booth and opened it and
said to him, “O my child, when the Sultan shall send after thee
and shall question thee concerning me, do thou tell him that I
am in such a town where shouldst thou come to seek me thou
shalt find me sitting beside the gate.” Then he farewelled the
boy, the barber’s apprentice, and set forth seeking that city. Such
was the case with these twain; but as regards the matter of the
King, he ceased not standing there until they had brought the
crucibles to the cannon-moulds and when the folks designed to
pour out their contents they found all therein pure gold. Then
quoth the Sultan to the Wazir and the Notables of his realm,
“Who was it threw aught into the crucibles and what stranger man
happened to be here?” Quoth they, “We beheld a Darwaysh
man who took some powder and fell to casting thereof a somewhat
into the crucibles.” Hereupon enquiries were made of the
bystanders and they gave information how that same Darwaysh
was inclined to the barber’s apprentice who lived in such a quarter.
Hereupon the Sultan ordered one of his Chamberlains to bring
the boy,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Fifty-third Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sent one of his Chamberlains to the boy, the apprentice of the
barber, whom they sought for and brought into the presence and
placed between the royal hands; and he on entering kissed ground
and deprecated and prayed for his liege lord with prayers fit for
the Caliphs. The Sovran returned his salam and questioned him
concerning the Darwaysh who had been with him and he replied,
“O King of the Realm, he charged me saying that he was faring
for and would be found in such a city.” Hereupon the Sultan
commanded the lad go forth and bring him, and was answered,
“Hearkening and obedience;” so he appointed for him an especial
ship and gifted him with various presents and the boy set sail and
voyaged for a short while till he reached the port-town in question.
Here he landed and made for the city-gate and as he entered it
behold, he came face to face with the Darwaysh who was
sitting upon a raised bench, and when he beheld him he salam’d
to him and told him what had taken place. The Fakir at
once arose, and without resisting the lad, went down to
the ship and they shook out the sails and the two voyaged
together until they reached the city of the Sultan. Here the
twain went in to him and kissed ground between his hands and
salam’d to him and their greeting was answered. Now as to the
lad, the King largessed him largely and raised his degree to
Governor and despatched him to one of his provinces therein to
rule;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7258" id="noteref-7258" epub:type="noteref">7258</a> but as for the Darwaysh, he remained beside King Dahmár
the first day and the second until the seventh; after which quoth
the Sovran, “’Tis my desire that thou teach me the art and
mystery of making gold;” whereto the other replied, “Hearing
and obeying, O our lord the Sultan.” Presently the Darwaysh
arose; and, bringing a brazier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7259" id="noteref-7259" epub:type="noteref">7259</a> ranged thereupon the implements
of his industry and lighted a fire thereunder; then, fetching a
portion of lead and a modicum of tin and a quant. suff. of copper,
the whole weighing about a quintal, he fanned the flame that was
beneath the crucible until the metal was fluid as water. And
while the Sultan was sitting and looking on and considering the
operation, the Fakir brought out something from a casket and taking
a pinch of it on the ear-picker besprinkled therewith the lead and
copper and the tin which presently became virgin gold. He
repeated this feat once or twice before the King who after that
fell to working as the Religious had wrought and turned out in
his presence the purest gold. So the Sultan rejoiced and was
wont to sit before the Darwaysh whatever time his heart chose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7260" id="noteref-7260" epub:type="noteref">7260</a>
and there and then he gathered together ignoble metals and
besprinkled them with the powder<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7261" id="noteref-7261" epub:type="noteref">7261</a> which had been given to him
by the Fakir and all came out of the noblest gold. Now one night
of the nights, as the Sultan was sitting in his Harem and would
have worked as he had wrought in the presence of the Darwaysh,
nothing went right with him; whereat he was exceedingly sorrowful
and said, “I have neither magnified nor minished aught, so how
is this case?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7262" id="noteref-7262" epub:type="noteref">7262</a> As soon as it was morning he forgathered with
the Fakir and worked in his presence and produced virgin gold;
so in his surprise he said, “Walláhi, ’tis indeed most marvellous
that whatso I work alone cometh not right and when I have
wrought in presence of the Darwaysh it succeedeth and turneth to
gold.” After this the Sultan never transmuted metals save in the
presence of the Fakir, until one day of the days when his breast
was narrowed and he sought recreation in the gardens. Accordingly
he rode forth, he and the Lords of the land, taking also the
Darwaysh with him and he went to the riverside, the Monarch preceding
and the Mendicant following together with the suite. And as
the King rode along with a heavy hand upon the reins he grasped
them strongly and his fist closed upon them; but suddenly he relaxed
his grip when his seal-ring flew from his little finger and fell into
the water, where it sank to the bottom. Seeing this the Sultan
drew bridle and halted and said, “We will on no wise remove from
this place till such time as my seal-ring shall be restored to me.”
So the suite dismounted, one and all, and designed plunging into
the stream, when behold, the Fakir finding the King standing
alone and in woeful plight by cause of his signet asked him
saying, “What is to do with thee, O King of the Age, that I find
thee here halted?” He replied, “Verily my signet-ring of Kingship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7263" id="noteref-7263" epub:type="noteref">7263</a>
hath dropped from me into the river somewhere about this
place.” Quoth the Darwaysh, “Be not grieved, O our lord;” after
which he brought out from his breast pocket a pencase, and having
drawn from it a bit of bees’ wax, he fashioned it into the form of
a man and cast it into the water. Then he stood gazing thereat
when, lo and behold! the Figure came forth the river with the seal-ring
hanging to its neck and sprang upon the saddle-bow in front
of the Sultan. The King would have taken his signet when the
Form jumped off and approached the Darwaysh who hent the
ring in hand and rubbed it and the Figure at once became wax as
it had been. Hereupon the Darwaysh restored it to his pencase
and said to the Sovran, “Now do thou ride on!” All this and the
Lords of the land sat gazing upon the Darwaysh and what he had
done; after which the whole party fared forwards till they reached
the gardens, where they dismounted and took seat and fell to
conversing together. They enjoyed themselves that day and when
evening fell they remounted and sought their homes, and the
Darwaysh returned to the apartment which had been set apart
for him. But presently the Grandees of the realm forgathered
with the Sultan and said to him, “O King of the Age, yon Darwaysh
requireth of thee exceeding caution seeing that he, whenso
he ever will, availeth to slay everyone in the Palace, and after
doing thee die can raise himself to rule in thy stead.” “How
so?” quoth the King, and quoth they, “In that ’twere easy for
him to make Figures of wax and cause them prevail over thee
and over us, so that they may kill us and he may succeed thee as
Sultan; nor would this be aught of inconvenience to him.” Now
when the King heard these words he was afeared and cried, “By
Allah, sooth ye speak, and this is the right rede and one which
may not be blamed indeed!” presently adding, “And how shall
we manage with this Darwaysh?” Said they, “Do thou send for
him and summon him and slay him forthright; and better ’twere
that thou kill him ere he kill thee;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7264" id="noteref-7264" epub:type="noteref">7264</a> and if he say thee I will go
and return, suffer him not depart.” The Sultan acted after their
counsel and sending to fetch the Fakir——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sent after the Darwaysh and bade him be brought into the presence
and set between his hands, when he said to him, “O Darwaysh, do
thou know ’tis mine aim and intention to slay thee: say me then,
hast thou any charge thou wouldst send to thy family?” Quoth
the Religious, “Wherefore shouldst thou kill me, O our lord, and
what of ill deeds hath proceeded from me that thou shouldst
destroy me therefor, and do thou make me aware of my sin, and
then if I merit death kill me or decree to me banishment.” Quoth
the King, “There is no help but that I slay thee,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7265" id="noteref-7265" epub:type="noteref">7265</a> and the Darwaysh
fell to gentling him but it availed him naught; so as soon
as he was certified that the Sultan would not release him or dismiss
him, he arose and drew a wide ring upon the ground in noose shape
and measuring some fifteen ells, within which he described a lesser
circle. Then he stood up before the Sovran and said, “O King of
the Age, verily this greater circle is the dominion belonging to thee,
whilst the lesser round is mine own realm.” So saying he moved
from his place and stepped forwards and passing into the smaller
ring quoth he, “An thy reign, O King of the Age, be not ample for
me I will inhabit my own;” and forthright upon entering the
lesser circle he vanished from the view of those present. Cried
the Sultan to the Lords of the land, “Seize him”; but they availed
not to find him, and after going forth in search they returned and
reported that they could light upon no one. Then said the Sovran,
“He was beside me in this place and passed into the smaller ring;
so do ye seek for him again;” and accordingly they went forth
once more but could not see a trace of him. Hereupon the Sultan
repented and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah the Glorious, the Great: verily we have exceeded in
the matter of this Darwaysh and we have hearkened to the words
of hypocrites who caused us to fall into trouble by obeying them
in all they said to me against him. However, whatso they did to
me that will I do unto them.” And as soon as it was morning-tide
and the Lords of the land forgathered in the Divan, the Sultan
commanded to slay those who had counselled him to kill the Darwaysh,
and some of them were done to death and others of them
were banished the country.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7266" id="noteref-7266" epub:type="noteref">7266</a> Now when the Caliph Harun al-Rashid
heard this narrative from Manjab, he wondered with
extreme wonderment and said to him, “By Allah, O Manjab, thou
deservest to be a cup-companion of the Kings:” so he created
him from that moment his Equerry in honour to the Grand Wazir
Ja’áfar the Barmaki, whereof he had become brother-in-law. Now
after some time Al-Rashid asked from Manjab a tale concerning the
wiles of womankind, and when the youth hung his head groundwards
and blushed before him, Harun said to him, “O Manjab,
verily the place of the Kings in privacy is also the place for laying
aside gravity.” Said Manjab, “O Prince of True Believers, to-morrow
night (Inshallah!) I will tell thee a tale in brief concerning
the freaks of the gender feminine, and what things they do with
their mates.” Accordingly when night came on, the Caliph sent
for and summoned Manjab to the presence, and when he came
there he kissed ground and said, “An it be thy will, O Commander
of the Faithful, that I relate thee aught concerning the wiles of
wives, let it be in a private place lest haply one of the slave girls
hear me and any of them report my tale to the Queen.” Quoth
Rashid, “This is the right rede which may not be blamed indeed!”
So he went with him to a private place concealed from the folk,
and took seat, he and the youth, and none beside, when Manjab
related to him the following</p>

<p class="c014">It is related that there was a Badawi man who had a wife and he
dwelt under a tent of hair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7268" id="noteref-7268" epub:type="noteref">7268</a> in the desert where, as is the fashion
of Arabs, he used to shift from site to site for the purpose of
pasturing his camels. Now the woman was of exceeding beauty
and comeliness and perfection, and she had a friend (also a Badawi
man) who at all times would come to her and have his wicked will
of her, after which he would wend his ways. But one day of the
days her lover visited her and said, “Walláhi, ’tis not possible but
that what time we sleep together, I and thou, we make merry with
thy husband looking on.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the man which
was the friend of the Badawi’s wife said to her, “Walláhi, ’tis not
possible but that when we make merry, I and thou, thy husband
shall look upon us.” Quoth she, “Why should we suffer at such
time of our enjoyment either my husband or any wight to be
present?” and quoth he, “This must needs be, and unless thou
consent I will take to me a mistress other than thyself.” Then
said she, “How shall we enjoy ourselves with my husband looking
on? This is a matter which may not be managed.” Hereupon
the woman sat down and took thought of her affair and how she
should do for an hour or so, and presently she arose and dug her
amiddlemost the tent a hole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7269" id="noteref-7269" epub:type="noteref">7269</a> which would contain a man, wherein
she concealed her lover. Now, hard by the tent was a tall sycamore
tree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7270" id="noteref-7270" epub:type="noteref">7270</a> and as the noodle her husband was returning from the
wild the woman said to him, “Ho thou, Such-an-one! climb up
this tree and bring me therefrom a somewhat of figs that we may
eat them.” Said he, “’Tis well;” and arising he swarmed up the
tree-trunk, when she signed to her lover who came out and mounted
and fell to riding upon her. But her mate considered her and
cried aloud, “What is this, O whore: doth a man cavalcade thee
before me and the while I am looking at thee?” Then he came
down from the tree in haste, but he saw no one, for as soon as the
lover had finished his business the good-wife thrust him into the
hole amiddlemost the tent and covered him with a mat. When
the husband went inside to the booth and met his wife he found
no stranger with her so said she to him, “O man, thou hast sinned
against me, saying:—Verily, some one is riding thee; and thou
hast slandered me by falsely charging me with folly.” Quoth he,
“By Allah I saw thee with my own eyes;” but quoth she, “Do
thou sit here the while I have a look.” Hereupon she arose and
swarmed up the trunk and sat upon one of the branches, and as
she peered at her spouse she shrieked aloud crying, “O man, do
thou have some regard for thine honour. Why do on this wise
and lie down and allow a man to ride thee, and at this moment he
worketh his will on thee.” Said her husband, “Beside me there
is neither man nor boy.” And said she, “Here I am<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7271" id="noteref-7271" epub:type="noteref">7271</a> looking
at thee from the top of this tree.” Quoth he, “O woman, this
place must be haunted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7272" id="noteref-7272" epub:type="noteref">7272</a> so let us remove hence;” and quoth she,
“Why change our place? rather let us remain therein.” Hereupon
the Caliph said to Manjab, “By Allah, verily, this woman
was an adulteress;” and the youth replied, “Amongst womankind
indeed are many more whorish than this. But of that anon; and

  <h3 class="c013"><em>NOTE CONCERNING THE “TIRREA BEDE,” NIGHT 655.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c015">Scott refers to a tale in the “Bahar-Danush” (Bahár-i-Dánish); or, “Garden of
Knowledge,” translated by himself, story viii. lesson 4; chapter xii. vol. iii. pp. 64–68.
Cadell &amp; Co., Strand, London, 1799. Five women come from a town to draw water at
a well; and, finding there a young Brahmin, become his teachers and undertake to
instruct him in the “Tirrea” or fifth “Veda”—there being only four of these Hindu
Scriptures. Each lesson consists of an adventure showing how to cornute a husband, and
the fourth runs as follows. I leave them in Scott’s language:—</p>

<p>The fourth lady through dread of the arrow of whose cunning the warrior of the fifth
heaven<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7273" id="noteref-7273" epub:type="noteref">7273</a> trembled in the sky, like the reed, having bestowed her attention on the pilgrim
bramin (Brahman), despatched him to an orchard; and having gone home, said to her
husband, “I have heard that in the orchard of a certain husbandman there is a date
tree, the fruit of which is of remarkably fine flavour; but what is yet stranger, whoever
ascends it, sees many wonderful objects. If to-day, going to visit this orchard, we gather
dates from this tree, and also see the wonders of it, it will not be unproductive of
amusement.” In short, she so worked upon her husband with flattering speeches and
caresses, that <span xml:lang="la">nolens volens</span> he went to the orchard, and at the instigation of his wife,
ascended the tree. At this instant she beckoned to the bramin, who was previously
seated, expectantly, in a corner of the garden.</p>

<p>The husband, from the top of the tree, beholding what was not fit to be seen, exclaimed
in extreme rage, “Ah! thou shameless Russian-born<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7274" id="noteref-7274" epub:type="noteref">7274</a> wretch, what abominable action is
this?” The wife making not the least answer, the flames of anger seized the mind of
the man, and he began to descend from the tree; when the bramin with activity and
speed having hurried over the fourth section of the Tirrea Bede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7275" id="noteref-7275" epub:type="noteref">7275</a> went his way.</p>

<h3 class="c013">VERSE.</h3>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c016">
    <div><em>The road to repose is that of activity and quickness.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The wife during her husband’s descent from the tree having arranged her plan, said,
“Surely, man, frenzy must have deprived thy brain of the fumes of sense, that having
foolishly set up such a cry, and not reflecting upon thy own disgrace (for here, excepting
thyself, what male is present?), thou wouldst fix upon me the charge of infidelity?”
The husband, when he saw no person near, was astonished, and said to himself,
“Certainly, this vision must have been miraculous.”</p>

<p>The completely artful wife, from the hesitation of her husband, guessed the cause, and
impudently began to abuse him. Then instantly tying her vest round her waist she
ascended the tree. When she had reached the topmost branch, she suddenly cried out,
“O thou shameless man, what abominable action is this! If thy evil star hath led thee
from the path of virtue, surely thou mightest have in secret ventured upon it. Doubtless
to pull down the curtain of modesty from thy eyes, and with such impudence to commit
such a wicked deed is the very extreme of debauchery.”</p>

<p>The husband replied, “Woman, do not ridiculously cry out, but be silent; for such is the
property of this tree, that whoever ascends it, sees man or woman below in such situations.”
The cunning wife now came down, and said to her husband, “What a charming garden
and amusing spot is this! where one can gather fruit, and at the same time behold the
wonders of the world.” The husband replied, “Destruction seize the wonders which
falsely accuse man of abomination!” In short the devilish wife, notwithstanding the
