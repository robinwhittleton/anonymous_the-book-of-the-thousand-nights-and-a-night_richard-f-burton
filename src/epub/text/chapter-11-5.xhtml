			<h2 epub:type="title">The Ten Wazirs; or the History of King Azadbakht and His Son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5193" id="noteref-5193" epub:type="noteref">5193</a></h2>

<p>There was once, of old days, a king of the kings, whose name
was Azádbakht; his capital was hight Kunaym Madúd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5194" id="noteref-5194" epub:type="noteref">5194</a> and his
kingdom extended to the confines of Sístán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5195" id="noteref-5195" epub:type="noteref">5195</a> and from the confines
of Hindostan to the Indian Ocean. He had ten Wazirs, who
ordered his kingship and his dominion, and he was possessed of
judgment and exceeding wisdom. One day he went forth with certain
of his guards to the chase and fell in with an Eunuch riding a
mare and hending in hand the halter of a she-mule, which he led
along. On the mule’s back was a domed litter of brocade purfled
with gold and girded with an embroidered band set with pearls
and gems, and about it was a company of Knights. When King
Azadbakht saw this, he separated himself from his suite and,
making for the horsemen and that mule, questioned them, saying,
“To whom belongeth this litter and what is therein?” The
Eunuch answered, (for he knew not that the speaker was King
Azadbakht,) saying, “This litter belongeth to Isfahand, Wazir to
King Azadbakht, and therein is his daughter, whom he is minded
to marry to the King hight Zád Sháh.”</p>

<p class="c000">As the Eunuch was speaking with the king, behold, the maiden
raised a corner of the curtain that shut in the litter, so she might
look upon the speaker, and saw the king. When Azadbakht
beheld her and noted her fashion and her loveliness, (and indeed
never did seer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5196" id="noteref-5196" epub:type="noteref">5196</a> espy her like,) his soul inclined to her and she
took hold upon his heart and he was ravished by her sight. So
he said to the Eunuch, “Turn the mule’s head and return, for I am
King Azadbakht and in very sooth I will marry her myself, inasmuch
as Isfahand her sire is my Wazir and he will accept of this
affair and it will not be hard to him.” Answered the Eunuch,
“O king, Allah prolong thy continuance, have patience till I
acquaint my lord her parent, and thou shalt wed her in the way of
consent, for it besitteth thee not, neither is it seemly for thee, to
seize her on this wise, seeing that it will be an affront to her father
an if thou take her without his knowledge.” Quoth Azadbakht,
“I have not patience to wait till thou repair to her sire and return,
and no shame will betide him, if I marry her.” And quoth the
eunuch, “O my lord, naught that in haste is done long endureth
nor doth the heart rejoice therein; and indeed it behoveth thee
not to take her on this unseemly wise. Whatsoever betideth thee,
destroy not thyself with haste, for I know that her sire’s breast
will be straitened by this affair and this that thou dost will not
win thy wish.” But the king said, “Verily, Isfahand is my Mameluke
and a slave of my slaves, and I reck not of her father, an he
be fain or unfain.” So saying, he drew the reins of the mule and
carrying the damsel, whose name was Bahrjaur,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5197" id="noteref-5197" epub:type="noteref">5197</a> to his house
married her. Meanwhile, the Eunuch betook himself, he and the
knights to her sire and said to him, “O my lord, thou hast served
the king a many years’ service and thou hast not failed him a
single day; and now he hath taken thy daughter without thy consent
and permission.” And he related to him what had passed
and how the king had seized her by force. When Isfahand heard
the eunuch’s words, he was wroth with exceeding wrath and
assembling many troops, said to them, “Whenas the king
was occupied with his women<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5198" id="noteref-5198" epub:type="noteref">5198</a> we took no reck of him;
but now he putteth out his hand to our Harim; wherefore
’tis my rede that we look us out a place wherein we may have
sanctuary.” Then he wrote a letter to King Azadbakht, saying
to him, “I am a Mameluke of thy Mamelukes and a slave of
thy slaves and my daughter at thy service is a hand-maid, and
Almighty Allah prolong thy days and appoint thy times to be in
joy and gladness! Indeed, I went ever waist-girded in thy service
and in caring to conserve thy dominion and warding off from
thee all thy foes; but now I abound yet more than erewhile in
zeal and watchfulness, because I have taken this charge upon
myself, since my daughter is become thy wife.” And he despatched
a courier to the king with the letter and a present.
When the messenger came to King Azadbakht and he read the
letter and the present was laid before him, he rejoiced with joy
exceeding and occupied himself with eating and drinking, hour
after hour. But the chief Wazir of his Wazirs came to him and said,
“O king, know that Isfahand the Wazir is thine enemy, for that his
soul liketh not that which thou hast done with him, and this
message he hath sent thee is a trick; so rejoice thou not
therein, neither be thou misled by the sweets of his say and the
softness of his speech.” The king hearkened to his Wazir’s speech,
but presently made light of the matter and busied himself with
that which he was about of eating and drinking, pleasuring and
merrymaking. Meanwhile, Isfahand the Wazir wrote a letter and
sent it to all the Emirs, acquainting them with that which had betided
him from King Azadbakht and how he had forced his
daughter, adding, “And indeed he will do with you more than
he hath done with me.” When the letter reached the chiefs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5199" id="noteref-5199" epub:type="noteref">5199</a>
they all assembled together to Isfahand and said to him, “What
was his affair?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5200" id="noteref-5200" epub:type="noteref">5200</a> Accordingly he discovered to them the matter
of his daughter and they all agreed, of one accord, to strive
for the slaughter of the king; and, taking horse with their troops,
they set out to seek him. Azadbakht knew naught till the noise
of the revolt beset his capital city, when he said to his wife
Bahrjaur, “How shall we do?” She answered, “Thou knowest
best and I am at thy commandment;” so he bade fetch two swift
horses and bestrode one himself, whilst his wife mounted the other.
Then they took what they could of gold and went forth, flying
through the night to the desert of Karmán;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5201" id="noteref-5201" epub:type="noteref">5201</a> while Isfahand
entered the city and made himself king. Now King Azadbakht’s
wife was big with child and the labour pains took her in the
mountain; so they alighted at the foot, by a spring of water, and
she bare a boy as he were the moon. Bahrjaur his mother pulled
off a coat of gold-woven brocade and wrapped the child therein,
and they passed the night in that place, she giving him the breast
till morning. Then said the king to her, “We are hampered by
this child and cannot abide here nor can we carry him with us; so
methinks we had better leave him in this stead and wend our ways,
for Allah is able to send him one who shall take him and rear him.”
So they wept over him with exceeding sore weeping and left him
beside the fountain, wrapped in that coat of brocade: then they
laid at his head a thousand gold pieces in a bag and mounting
their horses, fared forth and fled. Now, by the ordinance of the
Most High Lord, a company of highway robbers fell upon a caravan
hard by that mountain and despoiled them of what was with
them of merchandise. Then they betook themselves to the highlands,
so they might share their loot, and looking at the foot
thereof, espied the coat of brocade: so they descended to see
what it was, and behold, it was a boy wrapped therein and the gold
laid at his head. They marvelled and said, “Praised be Allah!
By what misdeed cometh this child here?” Thereupon they divided
the money between them and the captain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5202" id="noteref-5202" epub:type="noteref">5202</a> of the highwaymen
took the boy and made him his son and fed him with sweet milk
and dates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5203" id="noteref-5203" epub:type="noteref">5203</a> till he came to his house, when he appointed a nurse
for rearing him. Meanwhile, King Azadbakht and his wife stayed
not in their flight till they came to the court of the King of Fars,
whose name was Kisra<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5204" id="noteref-5204" epub:type="noteref">5204</a>. When they presented themselves to him,
he honoured them with all honour and entertained them with
handsomest entertainment, and Azadbakht told him his tale from
incept to conclusion. So he gave him a mighty power and wealth
galore and he abode with him some days till he was rested, when
he made ready with his host and setting out for his own dominions,
waged war with Isfahand and falling in upon the capital, defeated
the whilome Minister and slew him. Then he entered the city and
sat down on the throne of his kingship; and whenas he was rested
and his kingdom waxed peaceful for him, he despatched messengers
to the mountain aforesaid in search of the child; but they
returned and informed the king that they had not found him. As
time ran on, the boy, the son of the king, grew up and fell to
cutting the way<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5205" id="noteref-5205" epub:type="noteref">5205</a> with the highwaymen, and they used to carry
him with them, whenever they went banditing. They sallied forth
one day upon a caravan in the land of Sistan, and there were
in that caravan strong men and valiant, and with them a mighty
store of merchandise. Now they had heard that in that land
banditti abounded: so they gathered themselves together and
gat ready their weapons and sent out spies, who returned and gave
them news of the plunderers. Accordingly, they prepared for
battle, and when the robbers drew near the caravan, they fell upon
them and the twain fought a sore fight. At last the caravan-folk
overmastered the highwaymen by dint of numbers, and slew some
of them, whilst the others fled. They also took the boy, the son
of King Azadbakht, and seeing him as he were the moon, a model of
beauty and loveliness, bright of face and engraced with grace,
asked him, “Who is thy father, and how camest thou with these
banditti?” And he answered, saying, “I am the son of the
Captain of the highwaymen.” So they seized him and carried him
to the capital of his sire, King Azadbakht. When they reached
the city, the king heard of their coming and commanded that they
should attend him with what befitted of their goods. Accordingly
they presented themselves before him, and the boy with them, whom
when the king saw, he asked them, “To whom belongeth this
boy?” and they answered, “O King, we were going on such a road,
when there came out upon us a sort of robbers; so we fought
them and beat them off and took this boy prisoner. Then we
questioned him, saying, Who is thy sire? and he replied, I am the
son of the robber-captain.” Quoth the king, “I would fain have
this boy;” and quoth the captain of the caravan, “Allah maketh
thee gift of him, O king of the age, and we all are thy slaves.”
Then the king (who was not aware that the boy was his son) dismissed
the caravan and bade carry the lad into his palace and he
became as one of the pages, while his sire the king still knew not
that he was his child. As the days rolled on, the king observed in
him good breeding and understanding and handiness galore and
he pleased him; so he committed his treasuries to his charge and
shortened the Wazirs’ hand therefrom, commanding that naught
should be taken forth save by leave of the youth. On this wise
he abode a number of years and the king saw in him only good
conduct and the habit of righteousness. Now the treasuries had
been aforetime in the hands of the Wazirs to do with them whatso
they would, and when they came under the youth’s hand, that of
the Ministers was shortened from them, and he became dearer
than a son to the king who could not support being separated from
him. When the Wazirs saw this, they were jealous of him and
envied him and sought a device against him whereby they might oust
him from the King’s eye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5206" id="noteref-5206" epub:type="noteref">5206</a> but found no means. At last, when Fate
descended,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5207" id="noteref-5207" epub:type="noteref">5207</a> it chanced that the youth one day of the days drank wine
and became drunken and wandered from his right wits; so he fell
to going round about within the king’s palace and Destiny led him
to the lodging of the women, in which there was a little sleeping
chamber, where the king lay with his wife. Thither came the
youth and entering the dormitory, found there a spread couch, to
wit, a sleeping place: so he cast himself on the bed, marvelling at
the paintings that were in the chamber, which was lighted by
one waxen taper. Presently he fell asleep and slumbered heavily
till eventide, when there came a hand-maid, bringing with her as of
wont all the dessert, eatables and drinkables, usually made ready
for the king and his wife, and seeing the youth lying on his back,
(and none knowing of his case and he in his drunkenness
unknowing where he was), thought that he was the king asleep
on his couch; so she set the censing-vessel and laid the perfumes
by the bedding, then shut the door and went her ways. Soon after
this, the king arose from the wine-chamber and taking his wife by
the hand, repaired with her to the chamber in which he slept.
He opened the door and entered when, lo and behold! he saw the
youth lying on the bed, whereupon he turned to his wife and said
to her, “What doth this youth here? This fellow cometh not
hither save on thine account.” Said she, “I have no knowledge
of him.” Hereupon the youth awoke and seeing the king, sprang
up and prostrated himself before him, and Azadbakht said to him,
“O vile of birth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5208" id="noteref-5208" epub:type="noteref">5208</a> O traitor of unworth, what hath driven thee to
my dwelling?” And he bade imprison him in one place and the
Queen in another.</p>

<h3 class="c012">OF THE USELESSNESS OF ENDEAVOUR AGAINST PERSISTENT ILL FORTUNE.</h3>

<p class="c013">When the morning morrowed and the king sat on the throne of
his kingship, he summoned his Grand Wazir, the Premier of all his
Ministers, and said to him, “How seest thou the deed this robber-youth
hath done?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5209" id="noteref-5209" epub:type="noteref">5209</a> He hath entered my Harim and lain down
on my couch and I fear lest there be an object between him
and the woman. What deemest thou of the affair?” Said the
Wazir, “Allah prolong the king’s continuance! What sawest
thou in this youth?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5210" id="noteref-5210" epub:type="noteref">5210</a> Is he not ignoble of birth, the son of
thieves? Needs must a thief revert to his vile origin, and
whoso reareth the serpent’s brood shall get of them naught
but biting. As for the woman, she is not at fault; since from
time ago until now, nothing appeared from her except good breeding
and modest bearing; and at this present, an the king give me
leave, I will go to her and question her, so I may discover to thee
the affair.” The king gave him leave for this and the Wazir went
to the Queen and said to her, “I am come to thee, on account of
a grave shame, and I would fain have thee soothfast with me in
speech and tell me how came the youth into the sleeping-chamber.”
Quoth she, “I have no knowledge whatsoever of it, no, none at
all,” and sware to him a binding oath to that intent, whereby he
knew that the woman had no inkling of the affair, nor was in fault
and said to her, “I will show thee a sleight, wherewith thou mayst
acquit thyself and thy face be whitened before the king.” Asked
she, “What is it?” and he answered, “When the king calleth
for thee and questioneth thee of this, say thou to him:—Yonder
youth saw me in the boudoir-chamber and sent me a
message, saying:—I will give thee an hundred grains of gem for
whose price money may not suffice, so thou wilt suffer me to enjoy
thee. I laughed at him who bespake me with such proposal and
rebuffed him; but he sent again to me, saying:—An thou consent
not thereto, I will come one of the nights, drunken, and enter and lie
down in the sleeping-chamber, and the king will see me and slay
me; so wilt thou be put to shame and thy face shall be blackened
with him and thine honour dishonoured. Be this thy saying to
the king, and I will fare to him forthright and repeat this to him.”
Quoth the Queen, “And I also will say thus.” Accordingly, the
Minister returned to the king and said to him, “Verily, this youth
hath merited grievous pains and penalties after the abundance of
thy bounty, and no kernel which is bitter can ever wax sweet;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5211" id="noteref-5211" epub:type="noteref">5211</a> but,
as for the woman, I am certified that there is no default in her.”
Thereupon he repeated to the king the story which he had taught
the Queen, which when Azadbakht heard, he rent his raiment and
bade the youth be brought. So they fetched him and set him before
the king, who bade summon the Sworder, and the folk all fixed their
eyes upon the youth, to the end that they might see what the
sovran should do with him. Then said Azadbakht to him (and
his words were words of anger and the speech of the youth was
reverent and well-bred), “I bought thee with my money and
looked for fidelity from thee, wherefore I chose thee over all my
Grandees and Pages and made thee Keeper of my treasuries. Why,
then, hast thou outraged mine honour and entered my house and
played traitor with me and tookest thou no thought of all I have
done thee of benefits?” Replied the youth, “O king, I did this
not of my choice and freewill and I had no business in being there;
but, of the lack of my luck, I was driven thither, for that Fate was
contrary and fair Fortune failed me. Indeed, I had endeavoured
with all endeavour that naught of foulness should come forth me
and I kept watch and ward over myself, lest default foreshow in
me; and none may withstand an ill chance, nor doth striving
profit against adverse Destiny, as appeareth by the example of the
merchant who was stricken with ill luck and his endeavour availed
him naught and he fell by the badness of his fortune.” The king
asked, “What is the story of the merchant and how was his luck
changed upon him by the sorriness of his doom?” Answered the
youth, “May Allah prolong the king’s continuance!” and began</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF THE MERCHANT WHO LOST HIS LUCK.</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5212" id="noteref-5212" epub:type="noteref">5212</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a merchant man, who prospered in trade, and
at one time his every dirham won him fifty. Presently, his luck
turned against him and he knew it not; so he said to himself, “I
have wealth galore, yet do I toil and travel from country to
country; so better had I abide in my own land and rest myself in
my own house from this travail and trouble and sell and buy at
home.” Then he made two parts of his money, and with one
bought wheat in summer, saying “Whenas winter cometh, I shall
sell it at a great profit.” But, when the cold set in wheat fell to
half the price for which he had purchased it, whereat he was concerned
with sore chagrin and left it till the next year. However,
the price then fell yet lower and one of his intimates said to him,
“Thou hast no luck in this wheat; so do thou sell it at whatsoever
price.” Said the merchant, “Ah, long have I profited! so ’tis
allowable that I lose this time. Allah is all-knowing! An it
abide with me ten full years, I will not sell it save for a gaining
bargain.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5213" id="noteref-5213" epub:type="noteref">5213</a> Then he walled up in his anger the granary-door with
clay, and by the ordinance of Allah Almighty, there came a great
rain and descended from the terrace-roofs of the house wherein
was the wheat so that the grain rotted; and the merchant had to
pay the porters from his purse five hundred dirhams for them to
carry it forth and cast it without the city, the smell of it having
become fulsome. So his friend said to him, “How often did I
tell thee thou hadst no luck in wheat? But thou wouldst not give
ear to my speech, and now it behoveth thee to go to the astrologer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5214" id="noteref-5214" epub:type="noteref">5214</a>
and question him of thine ascendant.” Accordingly the trader
betook himself to the astrologer and questioned him of his star,
and astrophil said to him, “Thine ascendant is adverse. Put
not forth thy hand to any business, for thou wilt not prosper
thereby.” However, he paid no heed to the astrologer’s words and
said in himself, “If I do my business, I am not afraid of aught.”
Then he took the other half of his money, after he had spent the
first in three years, and builded him a ship, which he loaded with a
cargaison of whatso seemed good to him and all that was with him
and embarked on the sea, so he might voyage questing gain. The
ship remained in port some days, till he should be certified whither
he would wend, and he said, “I will ask the traders what this
merchandise profiteth and in what land ’tis wanted and how much
can it gain.” They directed him to a far country, where his
dirham should produce an hundredfold. So he set sail and made
for the land in question; but, as he went, there blew on him a
furious gale, and the ship foundered. The merchant saved himself
on a plank and the wind cast him up, naked as he was, on the
sea-shore, where stood a town hard by. He praised Allah and gave
Him thanks for his preservation; then, seeing a great village nigh
hand, he betook himself thither and saw, seated therein, a very
old man, whom he acquainted with his case and that which had
betided him. The Shaykh grieved for him with sore grieving,
when he heard his tale and set food before him. He ate of it
and the old man said to him, “Tarry here with me, so I may
make thee my overseer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5215" id="noteref-5215" epub:type="noteref">5215</a> and factor over a farm I have here, and
thou shalt have of me five dirhams a day.” Answered the merchant,
“Allah make fair thy reward, and requite thee with His
boons and bounties.” So he abode in this employ, till he had
sowed and reaped and threshed and winnowed, and all was clean
in his hand and the Shaykh appointed neither agent nor inspector,
but relied utterly upon him. Then the merchant bethought
himself and said, “I doubt me the owner of this grain will never
give me my due; so the better rede were to take of it after the
measure of my wage; and if he give me my right, I will return
to him that I have taken.” So he laid hands upon the grain, after
the measure of that which fell to him, and hid it in a hiding
place. Then he carried the rest and meted it out to the old man,
who said to him “Come, take thy wage, for which I conditioned
with thee, and sell the grain and buy with the price clothes and
what not else; and though thou abide with me ten years, yet shalt
thou still have this hire and I will acquit it to thee on this wise.”
Quoth the merchant in himself, “Indeed, I have done a foul deed
by taking it without his permission.” Then he went to fetch that
which he had hidden of the grain, but found it not and returned,
perplexed, sorrowful, to the Shaykh, who asked him, “What
aileth thee to be mournful?” and he answered, “Methought thou
wouldst not pay me my due; so I took of the grain, after the
measure of my hire; and now thou hast paid me all my right and
I went to bring back to thee that which I had hidden from thee,
but found it gone, for those who had come upon it have stolen it.”
The Shaykh was wroth, when he heard these words, and said to
the merchant, “There is no device against ill luck! I had given
thee this but, of the sorriness of thy doom and thy fortune, thou
hast done this deed, O oppressor of thine own self! Thou
deemedst I would not fulfil to thee thy wage; but, by Allah,
nevermore will I give thee aught.” Then he drove him away from
him. So the merchant went forth, woeful, grieving, weeping-eyed,
and wandered along the sea-shore, till he came to a sort of duckers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5216" id="noteref-5216" epub:type="noteref">5216</a>
diving in the sea for pearls. They saw him weeping and wailing
and said to him, “What is thy case and what garreth thee shed
tears?” So he acquainted them with his history, from incept
to conclusion, whereby the duckers knew him and asked him “Art
thou Such-an-one, son of Such-an-one?” He answered “Yes;”
whereupon they condoled with him and wept sore for him and
said to him, “Abide here till we dive upon thy luck this next time
and whatso betideth us shall be between us and thee.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5217" id="noteref-5217" epub:type="noteref">5217</a> Accordingly,
they ducked and brought up ten oyster-shells, in each two
great unions: whereat they marvelled and said to him, “by Allah,
thy luck hath re-appeared and thy good star is in the ascendant!”
Then the pearl-fishers gave him the ten pearls and said to him, “Sell
two of them and make them thy stock-in-trade: and hide the rest
against the time of thy straitness.” So he took them, joyful and
contented, and applied himself to sewing eight of them in
his gown, keeping the two others in his mouth; but a thief
saw him and went and advertised his fellows of him; whereupon
they gathered together upon him, and took his gown
and departed from him. When they were gone away, he arose,
saying, “The two unions I have will suffice me,” and made for the
nearest city, where he brought out the pearls for sale. Now
as Destiny would have it, a certain jeweller of the town
had been robbed of ten unions, like those which were with the
merchant; so, when he saw the two pearls in the broker’s hand,
he asked him, “To whom do these belong?” and the broker
answered, “To yonder man.” The jeweller, seeing the merchant
in pauper case and clad in tattered clothes, suspected him and
said to him, “Where be the other eight pearls?” The merchant
thought he asked him of those which were in the gown, whenas
the man had purposed only to surprise him into confession, and
replied, “The thieves stole them from me.” When the jeweller
heard his reply, he was certified that it was the wight who had
taken his good; so he laid hold of him and haling him before the
Chief of Police, said to him, “This is the man who stole my
unions: I have found two of them upon him and he confesseth to
the other eight.” Now the Wali knew of the theft of the pearls;
so he bade throw the merchant into jail. Accordingly they
imprisoned him and whipped him, and he lay in trunk a whole
year, till, by the ordinance of Allah Almighty, the Chief of Police
arrested one of the divers aforesaid, and imprisoned him in the
prison where the merchant was jailed. The ducker saw him and
knowing him, questioned him of his case; whereupon he told
them his tale, and that which had befallen him; and the diver
marvelled at the lack of his luck. So, when he came forth of the
prison, he acquainted the Sultan with the merchant’s case and told
him that it was he who had given him the pearls. The Sultan
bade bring him forth of the jail, and asked him of his story,
whereupon he told him all that had befallen him, and the Sovran
pitied him and assigned him a lodging in his own palace, together
with pay and allowances for his support. Now the lodging in
question adjoined the king’s house, and whilst the merchant was
rejoicing in this and saying, “Verily, my luck hath returned, and
I shall live in the shadow of this king the rest of my life,” he
espied an opening walled up with clay and stones. So he cleared
the opening the better to see what was behind it, and behold, it
was a window giving upon the lodging of the king’s women.
When he saw this, he was startled and affrighted and rising in
haste, fetched clay and stopped it up again. But one of the
eunuchs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5218" id="noteref-5218" epub:type="noteref">5218</a> saw him, and suspecting him, repaired to the Sultan, and
told him of this. So he came and seeing the stones pulled out,
was wroth with the merchant and said to him, “Be this my
reward from thee, that thou seekest to unveil my Harim?”
Thereupon he bade pluck out his eyes; and they did as he
commanded. The merchant took his eyes in his hand and said,
“How long, O star of ill-omen, wilt thou afflict me? First my
wealth and now my life!” And he bewailed himself, saying,
“Striving profiteth me naught against evil fortune. The
Compassionate aided me not, and effort was worse than
useless.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5219" id="noteref-5219" epub:type="noteref">5219</a> “On like wise, O king,” continued the youth, “whilst
fortune was favourable to me, all that I did came to good; but
now that it hath turned against me, everything turneth to mine ill.”
When the youth had made an end of his tale, the king’s anger
subsided a little, and he said, “Return him to the prison, for the
day draweth to an end, and to-morrow we will look into his
affair, and punish him for his ill-deeds.”</p>

<h3 class="c012">OF LOOKING TO THE ENDS OF AFFAIRS.</h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the next day, the second of the king’s Wazirs, whose
name was Baharún, came in to him and said, “Allah advance
the king! This deed which yonder youth hath done is a grave
matter, and a foul misdeed and a heinous against the household of
the king.” So Azadbakht bade fetch the youth, because of the
Minister’s speech; and when he came into the presence, said
to him, “Woe to thee, O youth! There is no help but that I
do thee die by the dreadest of deaths, for indeed thou hast
committed a grave crime, and I will make thee a warning to the
folk.” The youth replied, “O king, hasten not, for the looking
to the ends of affairs is a column of the kingdom, and a cause
of continuance and assurance for the kingship. Whoso looketh
not to the issues of actions, there befalleth him that which befel
the merchant, and whoso looketh to the consequences of actions,
there betideth him of joyance that which betideth the merchant’s
son.” The king asked, “And what is the story of the merchant
and his sons?” and the youth answered, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE TALE OF THE MERCHANT AND HIS SONS</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5220" id="noteref-5220" epub:type="noteref">5220</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a merchant, who had abundant wealth, and a
wife to boot. He set out one day on a business journey, leaving
his wife big with child, and said to her, “Albeit, I now leave thee,
yet I will return before the birth of the babe, Inshallah!” Then
he farewelled her and setting out, ceased not faring from country
to country till he came to the court of one of the kings and foregathered
with him. Now this king needed one who should order
his affairs and those of his kingdom and seeing the merchant
well-bred and intelligent, he required him to abide at court and
entreated him honourably. After some years, he sought his
Sovran’s leave to go to his own house, but the king would not
consent to this; whereupon he said to him, “O king, suffer me
go and see my children and come again.” So he granted him
permission for this and, taking surety of him for his return, gave
him a purse, wherein were a thousand gold dinars. Accordingly,
the merchant embarked in a ship and set sail, intending for his
mother-land. On such wise fared it with the trader; but as regards
his wife, news had reached her that her husband had accepted
service with King Such-an-one; so she arose and taking her two
sons, (for she had borne twins in his absence,) set out seeking those
parts. As Fate would have it, they happened upon an island and
her husband came thither that very night in the ship. So the
woman said to her children, “The ship cometh from the country
where your father is: hie ye to the sea-shore, that ye may enquire
of him.” Accordingly, they repaired to the sea-shore and going
up into the ship, fell to playing about it and busied themselves
with their play till evening evened. Now the merchant their sire
lay asleep in the ship, and the noisy disport of the boys troubled
him; whereupon he rose to call out to them “Silence” and let the
purse with the thousand dinars fall among the bales of merchandise.
He sought for it and finding it not, buffeted his head and seized
upon the boys, saying, “None took the purse but you: ye were
playing all about the bales, so ye might steal somewhat, and there
was none here but you twain.” Then he took his staff, and laying
hold of the children, fell to beating them and flogging them, whilst
they wept, and the crew came round about them saying, “The
boys of this island are all rogues and robbers.” Then, of the
greatness of the merchant’s anger, he swore an oath that, except
they brought out the purse, he would drown them in the sea; so
when by reason of their denial his oath demanded the deed, he
took the two boys and binding them each to a bundle of reeds,
cast them into the water. Presently, finding that they tarried from
her, the mother of the two boys went searching for them, till she
came to the ship and fell to saying, “Who hath seen two boys of
mine? Their fashion is so and so and their age thus and thus.”
When the crew heard her words, they said, “This is the description
of the two boys who were drowned in the sea but now.” Their
mother hearing this began calling on them and crying, “Alas, my
anguish for your loss, O my sons! Where was the eye of your
father this day, that it might have seen you?” Then one of the
sailors asked her, “Whose wife art thou?” and she answered, “I
am the wife of Such-an-one the trader. I was on my way to him,
and there hath befallen me this calamity.” When the merchant
heard her words, he knew her and rising to his feet, rent his
raiment and beat his head and said to his wife, “By Allah, I have
destroyed my children with mine own hand! This is the end of
whoso looketh not to the endings of affairs. This is his reward
who taketh not time to reflect.” Then he took to wailing and
weeping over them, he and his wife, and he said to his shipmates,
“By Allah, I shall never enjoy my life, till I light upon news of
them!” And he began to go round about the sea, in quest of his
sons, but found them not. Meanwhile, the wind carried the two
children from the ship towards the land, and cast them up on the
sea-shore. As for one of them, a company of the guards of the
king of those parts found him and carried him to their lord, who
marvelled at him with exceeding marvel and adopted him, giving
out to the folk that he was his own son, whom he had hidden,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5221" id="noteref-5221" epub:type="noteref">5221</a> of
his love for him. So the folk rejoiced in him with joy exceeding,
for their lord’s sake, and the king appointed him his heir-apparent
and the inheritor of his kingdom. On this wise a number of
years passed, till the king died and they enthroned the youth
sovran in his stead, when he sat down on the seat of his kingship
and his estate flourished and his affairs prospered with all regularity.
Meanwhile, his father and mother had gone round about, in quest
of him and his brother, all the islands of the sea, hoping that the
tide might have cast them up, but found no trace of them; so they
despaired of them and took up their abode in a certain of the
islands. One day, the merchant, being in the market, saw a broker,
and in his hand a boy he was crying for sale, and said in himself,
“I will buy yonder boy, so I may solace myself with him for my
sons.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5222" id="noteref-5222" epub:type="noteref">5222</a> So he bought him and bore him to his house; and, when
his wife saw him, she cried out and said, “By Allah, this is my
son!” Accordingly his father and mother rejoiced in him with
exceeding joy and asked him of his brother; but he answered,
“The waves parted us and I knew not how it went with him.”
Therewith his father and mother consoled themselves with him and
on this wise a number of years passed by. Now the merchant and
his wife had homed them in a city of the land where their other
son was king, and when the boy they had recovered grew up, his
father assigned unto him merchandise, to the end that he might
travel therewith. Upon this he fared forth and entered the city
wherein his brother ruled and anon news reached the king that a
merchant had come thither with merchandise befitting royalties;
so he sent for him and the young trader obeyed the summons and
going in to him, sat down before him. Neither of them knew the
other; but blood moved between them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5223" id="noteref-5223" epub:type="noteref">5223</a> and the king said to the
merchant youth, “I desire of thee that thou tarry with me and I
will exalt thy station and give thee all that thou requirest and
cravest.” Accordingly, he abode with him awhile, never quitting
him; and when he saw that he would not suffer him to depart
from him, he sent to his father and mother and bade them remove
thither to him. Hereat they resolved upon moving to that
island, and their son still increased in honour with the king, albeit
he knew not that he was his brother. Now it chanced one night
that the king sallied forth without the city and drank and the wine
got the mastery of him and he became drunken. So, of the
youth’s fear for his safety, he said, “I will keep watch myself over
the king this night, seeing that he deserveth this from me, for that
which he hath done with me of kindly deeds;” and he arose
forthright and baring his brand, stationed himself at the door of
the king’s pavilion. But one of the royal pages saw him standing
there, with the drawn sword in his hand, and he was of those who
envied him his favour with the king; therefore, he said to him,
“Why dost thou on this wise at this time and in the like of
this place?” Said the youth, “I am keeping watch and ward
over the king myself, in requital of his bounties to me.” The page
said no more to him; however, when it was morning, he acquainted
a number of the king’s servants with the matter, and they said,
“This is an opportunity for us. Come, let us assemble together
and acquaint the king therewith, so the young merchant may lose
regard with him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5224" id="noteref-5224" epub:type="noteref">5224</a> and he rid us of him and we be at rest from
him.” So they assembled together and going in to the king, said
to him, “We have a warning wherewith we would warn thee.”
Quoth he, “And what is your warning?” and quoth they, “This
youth, the trader, whom thou hast taken into favour and whose rank
thou hast exalted above the chiefest of thy lords, we saw yesterday
bare his brand and design to fall upon thee, to the end that he
might slay thee.” Now when the king heard this, his colour changed
and he said to them, “Have ye proof of this?” They rejoined,
“What proof wouldst thou have? An thou desirest this, feign
thyself drunken again this night and lie down as if asleep, and
privily watch him and thou wilt see with thine eyes all that we
have mentioned to thee.” Then they went to the youth and said
to him, “Know that the king thanketh thee for thy dealing
yesternight and exceedeth in commendation of thy good deed;”
and they prompted him again to do the like. Accordingly, when
the next night came, the king abode on wake, watching the youth;
and as for the latter, he went to the door of the pavilion and
unsheathing his scymitar, stood in the doorway. When the king
saw him do thus, he was sore disquieted and bade seize him and
said to him, “Is this my reward from thee? I showed thee favour
more than any else and thou wouldst do with me this abominable
deed.” Then arose two of the king’s pages and said to him, “O
our lord, an thou order it, we will smite his neck.” But the king
said, “Haste in killing is a vile thing, for ’tis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5225" id="noteref-5225" epub:type="noteref">5225</a> a grave matter; the
quick we can kill, but the killed we cannot quicken, and needs
must we look to the end of affairs. The slaying of this youth will
not escape us.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5226" id="noteref-5226" epub:type="noteref">5226</a> Therewith he bade imprison him, whilst he
himself went back to the city and, his duties done, fared forth to
the chase. Then he returned to town and forgot the youth; so the
pages went in to him and said to him, “O king, an thou keep
silence concerning yonder youth, who designed to slaughter thee,
all thy servants will presume upon the king’s majesty, and indeed
the folk talk of this matter.” Hereat the king waxed wroth and
cried, “Fetch him hither;” and bade the headsman strike off his
head. So they brought the youth and bound his eyes; and the
sworder stood at his head and said to the king, “By thy leave, O
my lord, I will smite his neck.” But the king cried, “Stay, till I
look into his affair. Needs must I put him to death and the
dispatching of him will not escape me.” Then he restored him to
the prison and there he abode till it should be the king’s will to do
him die. Presently, his parents heard of the matter; whereupon
his father arose and going up to the palace, wrote a letter and
presented it to the king, who read it, and behold, therein was
written, saying, “Have ruth on me, so may Allah have ruth on
thee, and hasten not in the slaughter of my son; for indeed I acted
hastily in a certain affair and drowned his brother in the sea, and
to this day I bemourn him. An thou must needs kill him, kill me
in his stead.” Therewith the old merchant, weeping bitterly,
prostrated himself before that king, who said to him, “Tell me
thy tale.” Said the merchant, “O my lord, this youth had a
brother and I in my haste cast the twain into the sea.” And he
related to him his story, first and last, whereupon the king cried
with a mighty loud cry and casting himself down from the throne,
embraced his father and brother and said to the merchant. “By
Allah, thou art my very father and this is my brother and thy wife
is our mother.” And they abode weeping, all three of them. Then
the king acquainted his people with the matter and said to them,
“O folk, how deem ye of my looking to the consequences of
action?;” and they all marvelled at his wisdom and foresight.
Then he turned to his sire and said to him, “Hadst thou looked to
the issue of thine affair and made due delay in whatso thou didst,
there had not betided thee this repentance and chagrin all this time.”
Thereupon he sent for his mother and they rejoiced one in other and
lived all their days in joy and gladness. “What then” (continued
the young treasurer), “is more grievous than the lack of looking
to the ends of things? Wherefore hasten thou not in the slaying
of me, lest penitence betide thee and sore chagrin.” When the
king heard this, he said, “Return him to the prison till the morrow,
so we may look into his affair; for that deliberation in such is
advisable and the slaughter of this youth shall not escape us.”</p>

<h3 class="c012">OF THE ADVANTAGES OF PATIENCE.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5227" id="noteref-5227" epub:type="noteref">5227</a></h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the third day, the third Wazir came in to the king
and said to him, “O king, delay not the matter of this youth,
because his deed hath caused us fall into the mouths of folk, and
it behoveth that thou slay him forthright, that the talk may be
cut from us and it be not said:—The king saw on his bed a man
with his wife and spared him.” The king was chagrined by these
words and bade bring the youth. Accordingly, they fetched him
in fetters, and indeed the king’s anger was upstirred against him
by the Minister’s speech and he was troubled; so he said to him,
“O base of birth, thou hast dishonoured us and marred our
mention, and needs must I do away thy life from the world.”
Quoth the youth, “O king, make use of patience in all thine
affairs, so wilt thou win to thy wish, for that Allah Almighty hath
appointed the issue of long-suffering to be in abounding good, and
indeed by patience Abú Sábir ascended from the pit and sat down
upon the throne.” Asked the king, “Who was Abu Sábir, and
what is his tale?” and the youth answered, saying, “Hear thou,
O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF ABU SABIR</i>.”</h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a man, a village headman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5228" id="noteref-5228" epub:type="noteref">5228</a> Abu Sabir hight,
and he had much black cattle and a buxom wife, who had borne
him two sons. They abode in a certain hamlet and there used to
come thither a lion and rend and devour Abu Sabir’s herd, so
that the most part thereof was wasted and his wife said to him one
day, “This lion hath wasted the greater part of our property.
Arise, mount thy horse and take thy host and do thy best to kill
him, so we may be at rest from him.” But Abu Sabir said, “Have
patience, O woman, for the issue of patience is praised. This lion
it is which transgresseth against us, and the transgressor, perforce
must Almighty Allah destroy him. Indeed, ’tis our long-suffering
that shall slay him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5229" id="noteref-5229" epub:type="noteref">5229</a> and he that doth evil needs must it recoil
upon him.” A few days after, the king went forth one morning
to hunt and falling in with the lion, he and his host, gave chase
to him and ceased not pursuit till they slew him. This news
reached Abu Sábir who improved the occasion to his wife, “Said
I not to thee, O woman, that whoso doth evil, it shall recoil
upon him? Haply an I sought to slay the lion myself, I had not
prevailed against him, and this is the issue of patience.” It befel,
after this, that a man was slain in Abu Sabir’s village; wherefore
the Sultan bade plunder the village, and they spoiled the patient
one’s goods with the rest. Thereupon his wife said to him, “All the
king’s officers know thee; so do thou prefer thy plaint to the sovran,
that he may bid thy beasts to be restored to thee.” But he said to
her, “O woman, said I not to thee that he who worketh wrong
shall be wronged? Indeed, the king hath done evil, and right
soon he shall suffer the issues of his deed, for whoso taketh the
goods of the folk, needs must his goods be taken.” A man of his
neighbours heard his speech, and he was an envier of his; so he
went to the Sultan and acquainted him therewith, whereupon the
king sent and plundered all the rest of his goods and drave him
forth from the village, and his wife and family with him. They
went wandering in the waste grounds about the hamlet and his wife
said to him, “All that hath befallen us cometh of thy slowness in
affairs and thy helplessness.” But he said to her, “Have patience,
for the issue of patience is good.” Then they walked on a little
way, and thieves met them and despoiling them of whatso remained
with them, stripped them of their raiment and took from them the
two children; whereupon the woman wept and said to her husband,
“Hearkye, my good man, put away from thee this folly and up
with us to follow the thieves, so, peradventure they may have compassion
on us and restore the children to us.” He replied, “O
woman, have patience, for he who doth evil shall be requited with
evil and his frowardness shall revert upon him. Were I to follow
them, belike one of them would take his sword and smite my
neck and slay me; but have patience, for the issue of patience is
praised.” Then they fared on till they made a village<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5230" id="noteref-5230" epub:type="noteref">5230</a> in the
land of Kirman, and by it a river of water; so the man said to his
wife, “Tarry thou here, whilst I enter the village and look us out a
place wherein we may home ourselves.” And he left her by the
water and entered the village. Presently, up came a horseman in
quest of water, wherewith to water his horse: he saw the woman
and she was pleasing in his eyes; so quoth he to her, “Arise,
mount with me and I will take thee to wife and entreat thee
kindly.” Quoth she, “Spare me, so may Allah spare thee! Indeed
I have a husband.” But he drew his dudgeon and said to
her, “An thou obey me not, I will smite thee and slay thee.”
When she saw his frowardness, she wrote on the ground in the sand
with her finger, saying, “O Abu Sabir, thou hast not ceased to be
patient, till thy good is gone from thee and thy children and now
thy wife, who was more precious in thy sight than everything and
than all thy monies, and indeed thou abidest in thy sorrow the whole
of thy life long, so thou mayest see what thy patience will profit
thee.” Then the horseman took her, and setting her behind him,
went his way. As for Abu Sabir, when he returned, he saw not
his wife but he read what was writ upon the ground, wherefore he
wept and sat awhile sorrowing. Then said he to himself, “O
Abu Sabir, it behoveth thee to be patient, for haply there shall
betide thee an affair yet sorer than this and more grievous;” and
he went forth a-following his face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5231" id="noteref-5231" epub:type="noteref">5231</a> like to one love-distraught and
passion-madded, till he came to a gang of labourers working upon
the palace of the king, by way of forced labour.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5232" id="noteref-5232" epub:type="noteref">5232</a> When the overseers
saw him, they laid hold of him and said to him, “Work thou
with these folk at the palace of the king; else we will imprison
thee for life.” So he fell to working with them as a labourer and
every day they gave him a bannock of bread. He wrought with
them a month’s space, till it chanced that one of the labourers
mounted a ladder and falling, brake his leg; whereupon he cried
out and shed tears. Quoth Abu Sabir to him, “Have patience and
weep not; for in thine endurance thou shalt find ease.” But the
man said to him, “How long shall I have patience?” And he
answered, saying, “Long-suffering bringeth a man forth of the
bottom of the pit and seateth him on the throne of the kingdom.”
It so fortuned that the king was seated at the lattice, hearkening to
their talk, and Abu Sabir’s words angered him for the moment; wherefore
he bade bring him before him and they brought him forthright.
Now there was in the king’s palace an underground dungeon
and therein a vast silo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5233" id="noteref-5233" epub:type="noteref">5233</a> and a deep, into which the king caused
cast Abu Sabir, saying to him, “O little of wit, soon shall we see
how thou wilt come forth of the pit to the throne of the kingdom.”
Then he used continuously to come and stand at the mouth of
the pit and say, “O little of wit, O Abu Sabir,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5234" id="noteref-5234" epub:type="noteref">5234</a> I see thee not
come forth of the pit and sit down on the king’s throne!” And
he assigned him each day two bannocks of bread, whilst Abu
Sabir kept silence and spake not, but patiently bore whatso
betided him. Now the king had a brother, whom he had imprisoned
in that pit of old time, and he had died there; but the
folk of the realm deemed him still alive, and when his durance
grew long, the courtiers of the king used to talk of this and of
the tyranny of their liege Lord, and the bruit spread abroad that
the sovran was a tyrant, so they fell upon him one day and slew
him. Then they sought the silo and brought out therefrom Abu
Sabir, deeming him the king’s brother, for that he was the nearest
of folk to him in favour and the likest, and he had been long in
the pit. So they doubted not but that he was the Prince and
said to him, “Reign thou in thy brother’s room, for we have slain
him and thou art sovran in his stead.” But Abu Sabir was silent
and spoke not a word;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5235" id="noteref-5235" epub:type="noteref">5235</a> and he knew that this was the result of
his patience. Then he arose and sitting down on the king’s
throne, donned the royal dress and dispensed justice and equity,
and affairs prospered; wherefore the lieges obeyed him and the
subjects inclined to him and many were his soldiers. Now the king,
who erst had plundered Abu Sabir’s goods and driven him forth
of his village, had an enemy; and the foe mounted horse against
him and overcame him and captured his capital; wherefore he
betook him to flight and came to Abu Sabir’s city, craving support
of him and seeking that he should succour him. He knew not
that the king of the city was the headman whom he had spoiled;
so he presented himself before him and made complaint to him;
but Abu Sabir knew him and said to him, “This is somewhat of
the issue of patience. Allah the Most High hath given me power
over thee.” Then he commanded his guards to plunder the
unjust king and his suite; so they spoiled them and stripping
them of their clothes, put them forth of his country. When Abu
Sabir’s troops saw this, they marvelled and said, “What be this
deed the king doth? There cometh a king to him, craving protection,
and he spoileth him! This is not the fashion of kings.”
But they dared not speak of this. Presently, news came to the
king of highwaymen in his land; so he set out in quest of them
and ceased not to follow after them, till he seized on them all, and
behold, they were the very thieves who had plundered him and
his wife by the way and had carried off his children. Accordingly
he bade bring them before him, and when they came into his
presence, he questioned them, saying, “Where are the two boys
ye took on such a day?” Said they, “They are with us and we
will present them to our lord the king for Mamelukes to serve him
and give him wealth galore that we have gotten together and doff
all we own and repent from lawlessness and fight in thy service.”
Abu Sabir, however, paid no heed to their words, and seized all
their good and bade put them all to death. Furthermore, he took
his two boys and rejoiced in them with exceeding joy, whereat the
troops murmured among themselves, saying, “Verily, this is a
greater tyrant than his brother! There cometh to him a gang of
thieves, and they seek to repent and proffer two boys by way of
peace-offering, and he taketh the two lads and all their good and
slayeth them! Indeed this be violent oppression.” After this came
the horseman, who had seized Abu Sabir’s wife, and complained of
her to the king that she would not give him possession of her
person, and solemnly declared that she was his wife. The king
bade bring her before him, that he might hear her plea and
pronounce judgment upon her. So the horseman came with her
before him, and when the king saw her, he knew her and taking
her from her ravisher, bade put him to death. Then he became
aware of the troops, that they murmured against him and spake
of him as a tyrant; so he turned to his courtiers and ministers
and said to them, “As for me, by Allah of All-might,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5236" id="noteref-5236" epub:type="noteref">5236</a> I am not
the king’s brother! Nay, I am but one whom the king imprisoned
upon a word he heard from me and he used every day to
come and taunt me therewith. Ye deem me the king’s brother;
but I am Abu Sabir and the Lord hath given me the kingship in
virtue of my patience. As for the king who sought protection of
me and I plundered him, ’twas he who first wronged me, for that
he plundered me aforetime and drave me forth of my native land
and banished me, without due cause; wherefore I requited him
with that which he had done to me, in the way of lawful
retribution. As for the highwaymen who proffered repentance,
there was no repentance for them with me, because they began
upon me with foul dealing and waylaid me by the road and
despoiled me and seized my good and my sons, the two boys that
I took of them, and those ye deemed Mamelukes are my very
sons; so I avenged myself on the thieves of that which they did
with me whilome and requited them with strict justice. As for
the horseman whom I slew, this woman I took from him was my
wife and he seized her by force, but Allah the Most High hath
restored her to me; so this was my right, and my deed that I have
done was righteous, albeit ye, judging by the externals of the
matter, deemed that I had done this by way of tyranny.” When
the folk heard these words, they marvelled and fell prostrate before
him; and they redoubled in esteem for him and exceeding affection
and sued pardon of him, admiring that which Allah had done
with him and how He had given him the kingship by reason of his
longsuffering and his patience and how he had raised himself by
his endurance from the bottom of the pit to the throne of the
kingdom, what while Allah cast down the late king from the
throne into the pit.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5237" id="noteref-5237" epub:type="noteref">5237</a> Then Abu Sabir foregathered with his wife
and said to her, “How deemest thou of the fruit of patience and its
sweetness and the fruit of haste and its bitterness? Verily, all
that a man doth of good and evil, he shall assuredly encounter the
same.” “On like wise, O king” (continued the young treasurer),
“it besitteth thee to practise patience, whenever it is possible to
thee, for that longsuffering is the wont of the noble, and it is the
chiefest of their reliance, especially for kings.” When the king
heard this from the youth, his wrath subsided; so he bade return
him to the prison, and the folk dispersed that day.</p>

<h3 class="c012">OF THE ILL EFFECTS OF IMPATIENCE.</h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the fourth day, the fourth Wazir, whose name was
Zúshád,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5238" id="noteref-5238" epub:type="noteref">5238</a> made his appearance and prostrating himself to his liege
lord, said to him, “O king, let not the talk of yonder youth delude
thee, for that he is not a truth-teller. As long as he shall remain
alive, the folk will not leave talking nor will thy heart cease to
be occupied with him.” Cried the king, “By Allah, thou sayst
sooth and I will cause fetch him this day and slay him between
my hands.” Then bade he bring the youth; so they fetched him
in fetters and he said to him, “Woe to thee! Thinkest thou to
appease my heart with thy prate, whereby the days are spent in
talk? I mean to do thee die this day and be quit of thee.” Said
the youth, “O king, ’tis in thy power to put me out of the world
whenso thou wilt, but haste is the wont of the ignoble and patience
the sign of the noble. An thou do me to death, thou wilt repent,
and when thou desire to bring me back to life, thou wilt not be
able. Indeed, whoso acteth hastily in an affair, there befalleth
him what befel Bihzád, son of the king.” Quoth the king, “And
what is his tale?” Replied the treasurer, “O king, hear</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF PRINCE BIHZAD</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5239" id="noteref-5239" epub:type="noteref">5239</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once, of olden time, a king and he had a son Bihzad
hight, there was not in his tide a fairer than he and he loved to
fellow with the folk and to mix with the merchants and sit and
talk with them. One day, as he was seated in an assembly,
amongst a number of people, he heard them talking of his own
beauty and loveliness, and saying, “There be not in his time a
fairer than he.” But one of the company said, “Indeed, the
daughter of King Such-an-one is seemlier than he.” When Bihzad
heard this saying, his reason fled and his heart fluttered and he
called the last speaker and said to him, “Repeat to me that which
thou saidst and tell me the truth concerning her whom thou
avouchest to be goodlier than I and whose daughter she is.”
Quoth the man, “She is the daughter of King Such-an-one;”
whereupon Bihzad’s heart clave to her and his colour changed.
Presently the news reached his sire, who said to him, “O my son,
this maiden to whom thy heart cleaveth is at thy command and we
have power over her; so wait till I demand her in wedlock for
thee.” But the Prince said, “I will not wait.” So the king
hastened in the matter and sent to demand her of her sire, who
required of him an hundred thousand dinars paid down to his
daughter’s dowry. Quoth Bihzad’s father, “So be it,” and
weighed out what was in his treasuries, and there remained to
his charge but a little of the dower.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5240" id="noteref-5240" epub:type="noteref">5240</a> So he said, “Have
patience, O my son, till we gather together the rest of the
money and send to fetch her for thee, since now she is become
thine.” Therewith the Prince waxed wroth with exceeding wrath
and cried, “I will not have patience;” so he took his sword
and his lance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5241" id="noteref-5241" epub:type="noteref">5241</a> and mounting his horse, went forth and fell to
cutting the way<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5242" id="noteref-5242" epub:type="noteref">5242</a>. It chanced one day that he fell upon a company
of folk who overcame him by dint of numbers and taking him
prisoner, pinioned him and carried him to the lord of that land
wherein he was a-highwaying. This king saw his semblance and
loveliness and misdoubting of him, said, “This be no robber’s
favour. Tell me truly, O youth, who thou art.” Bihzad was
ashamed to acquaint him with his condition and preferred death
for himself; so he answered, “I am naught but a thief and a
bandit.” Quoth the king, “It behoveth us not to act hastily in
the matter of this youth, but that we look into his affair, for that
impatience gendereth penitence.” So he imprisoned him in his
palace and assigned him one to serve him. Meanwhile the
news spread abroad that Bihzad, son of the sovran, was lost,
whereupon his father sent letters in quest of him to all the kings
including him with whom he was imprisoned. When the letter
reached the latter, he praised Almighty Allah for that he had not
anyways hastened in Bihzad’s affair and bidding them bring him
before himself, said to him, “Art thou minded to destroy thy
life?” Quoth Bihzad, “I did this for fear of shame;” and the
king said, “An thou fear shame, thou shouldst not practise haste
in thy doings; knowest thou not that the fruit of impatience is
repentance? Had we hasted, we also, like thee, had repented.”
Then he conferred on him a robe of honour and engaged to him
for the completion of the dowry and sent to his father, giving him
the glad tidings and comforting his heart with news of his son’s
safety; after which he said to Bihzad, “Arise, O my son, and go
to thy sire.” Rejoined the Prince, “O king, complete thy
kindness to me by hastening my going-in to my wife; for, an I
go back to my sire, the time will be long till he send a messenger
and he return, promising me dispatch.” The king laughed and
marvelled at him and said to him, “I fear for thee from this
precipitancy, lest thou come to shame and win not thy wish.”
Then he gave him muchel of wealth and wrote him letters, commending
him to the father of the Princess, and despatched him to
them. When he drew near their country, the king came forth to
meet him with the people of his realm and assigned him a fine
lodging and bade hasten the going-in of his daughter to him, in
compliance with the other king’s letter. He also advised the
Prince’s father of his son’s coming and they busied themselves with
the affair of the young lady. When it was the day of the bride’s
going-in<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5243" id="noteref-5243" epub:type="noteref">5243</a> Bihzad, of his impetuosity and lack of patience, betook
himself to the wall, which was between himself and her lodging
and wherein was a hole pierced, and of his haste looked through
it, so he might see his bride. But her mother espied him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5244" id="noteref-5244" epub:type="noteref">5244</a> and this
was grievous to her; so she took from one of the pages two red-hot
iron spits and thrust them into the hole through which the
Prince was looking. The spits ran into his eyes and put them
out and he fell down fainting and the wedding-festival was
changed to mourning and sore concern. “See, then, O king”
(continued the youth), “the issue of the Prince’s haste and lack
of deliberation, for indeed his impatience bequeathed him long
penitence and his joy turned to annoy; and on like wise was it
with the woman who hastened to put out his eyes and delayed
not to deliberate. All this was the doing of haste; wherefore it
behoveth the king not to be hasty in putting me to death, for that I
am under the hold of his hand, and whatso time thou desirest my
slaughter, it shall not escape thee.” When the king heard this
his anger subsided and he said, “Return him back to the prison
till to-morrow, so we may look into his case.”</p>

<p class="c013">When it was the fifth day, the fifth Wazir, whose name was
Jahrbaur,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5245" id="noteref-5245" epub:type="noteref">5245</a> came in to the king and prostrating himself before him,
said, “O king, it behoveth thee, an thou see or hear one look

for the assurance of thine empire and of our zeal for thy loyal

that this youth should live for a single hour?” Therewith the
king was filled with fury and cried, “Bring him forthright.” So
they fetched the youth whom they set before him in fetters, and
the king said to him, “Woe to thee! Thou hast sinned a great
sin and the time of thy survival hath been long;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5247" id="noteref-5247" epub:type="noteref">5247</a> but needs must

am guiltless, and by reason of this I hope for life, for that he who
is innocent of all offence goeth not in fear of pains and penalties,
neither greateneth his mourning and his concern; but whoso hath
sinned, needs must his sin be expiated upon him, though his life
be prolonged, and it shall overtake him, even as it overtook

<p class="c013">There was once a king in the land of Tabaristan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5249" id="noteref-5249" epub:type="noteref">5249</a> by name
Dádbín, and he had two Wazirs, one called Zorkhan and the other
Kárdán.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5250" id="noteref-5250" epub:type="noteref">5250</a> The Minister Zorkhan had a daughter, there was not
in her day a fairer than she nor yet a chaster or a more pious,
for she was a faster, a prayer and an adorer of Allah the Almighty,
and her name was Arwà.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5251" id="noteref-5251" epub:type="noteref">5251</a> Now Dadbin, the king, heard tell of
her praises; so his heart clave to her and he called the Wazir
her sire and said to him, “I desire of thee that thou marry me to
thy daughter.” Quoth Zorkhan, “O my liegest lord, suffer me
to consult her, and if she consent, I will marry thee with her.”
And the king said, “Haste thee with this.” So the Minister
went in to his daughter and said to her, “O my daughter, the
king seeketh thee of me and desireth to marry thee.” She said,
“O my father, I desire not a husband, and if thou wilt marry me,
marry me not but with a mate who shall be mine inferior in rank
and I nobler than he, so he may not turn to other than myself nor
lift his eyes upon me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5252" id="noteref-5252" epub:type="noteref">5252</a> and marry me not to one who is nobler than
I, lest I be with him as a slave-girl and a serving-woman.” Accordingly
the Wazir returned to the king and acquainted him with that
which his daughter had said, whenas he redoubled in desire and
love-longing for her, and said to her sire, “An thou marry me not
to her of good grace, I will take her in thy despite and by force.”
The Minister again betook himself to his daughter and repeated
to her the king’s words, but she replied, “I want no husband.”
So he returned to the king and told him what she said, and he
was wroth and threatened him, whereupon the father took his
daughter and fled with her. When this came to the king’s
knowledge, he despatched troops in pursuit of Zorkhan, to stop
the road upon him, whilst he himself went out and overtaking
the Wazir, smote him on the head with his mace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5253" id="noteref-5253" epub:type="noteref">5253</a> and slew him.
Then he took his daughter by force and returning to his dwelling
place, went in to her and married her. Arwa resigned herself
with patience to that which betided her and committed her case
to Allah Almighty; and indeed she was used to serve Him night
and day with a goodly service in the house of King Dadbin her
husband. It befel one day that the king had occasion to make
a journey; so he called his second Wazir Kardan and said to
him, “I have a charge to commit to thy care, and it is yonder
lady, my wife, the daughter of the Wazir Zorkhan, and I desire
that thou keep her and guard her thy very self, because I have
not in the world aught dearer than she.” Quoth Kardan in his
mind, “Of a truth, the king honoureth me with an exceeding
honour in entrusting me with this lady.” And he answered,
“With love and all gladness.” When the king had departed on
his journey, Kardan said in himself, “Needs must I look upon
this lady whom the king loveth with all this love.” So he hid
himself in a place, that he might espy her, and saw her surpassing
description; wherefor he was confounded at her and his wit was
wildered and love gat the lordship of him, so that he sent to her,
saying, “Have pity on me, for indeed I perish for the love of
thee.” She sent back to him and replied, “O Wazir, thou art in
the place of faith and confidence, so do not thou betray thy trust,
but make thine inward life like unto thine outward<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5254" id="noteref-5254" epub:type="noteref">5254</a> and occupy
thyself with thy wife and that which is lawful to thee. As for
this, ’tis mere lust and women are all of one and the same taste.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5255" id="noteref-5255" epub:type="noteref">5255</a>
And if thou wilt not be forbidden from this talk, I will make
thee a byword and a reproach among folk.” When the Minister
heard her answer, he knew that she was chaste of soul and body;
wherefore he repented with the utmost of repentance and feared
for himself from the king and said, “Needs must I devise a device
whereby I may destroy her; else shall I be disgraced with
the king.” Now when the king returned from his journey, he
questioned Kardan of the affairs of his kingdom, and the Wazir
answered, “All is right well, O king, save a vile matter, which
I have espied here and with which I am ashamed to confront
the sovran; but, if I hold my peace thereof, I fear lest other than
I discover it and I shall have played traitor to the king in the
matter of my warning and my trust.” Quoth Dadbin, “Speak,
for to me thou art none other than a truth-teller, a trustworthy
and a loyal counsellor in whatso thou sayest, undistrusted in
aught.” And the Minister said, “O king, this woman to whose
love thy heart cleaveth and of whose piety thou talkest and her
fasting and her praying, I will plainly prove to thee that this
is craft and guile.” Hereat the king was troubled and said,
“What may be the matter?” and the Wazir replied, “I would have
thee wot that some days after thy departure, one came to me and
said to me, Come, O Wazir, and look. So I went to the door
of the queen’s sleeping-chamber and behold, she was sitting with
Abu al-Khayr, her father’s page, whom she favoureth, and she did
with him what she did, and such is the manner of that which I
saw and heard.” When Dadbin heard this, he burnt with rage
and said to one of his eunuchs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5256" id="noteref-5256" epub:type="noteref">5256</a> “Go and slay her in her chamber.”
But the eunuch said to him, “O king, Allah prolong thy life!
Indeed, the killing of her may not be in this way neither at this
time; but do thou bid one of thine Castratos take her up on a
camel and carry her to one of the trackless wolds and cast her
down there; so, if she be guilty, Allah shall cause her to perish,
and if she be innocent, He will deliver her, and the king shall
be free from default against her; for that this lady is dear to thee
and thou slewest her father by reason of thy love for her.” Quoth
the king, “By Allah, thou sayst sooth!” Then he bade one
of his eunuchs carry her on a camel to one of the far-off wilds and
cut-off wolds and there leave her and wend his ways, and he
forbad her torment to be prolonged. So he took her up and
betaking himself with her to the desert, left her there without
provaunt or water and returned, whereupon she made for one of
the hills, and ranging stones before her in form of prayer-niche,
stood praying. Now it chanced that a camel-driver, belonging to
Kisrà<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5257" id="noteref-5257" epub:type="noteref">5257</a> the king, lost certain camels, and his lord threatened him,
if he found them not, that he would slay him. Accordingly he set
out and plunged into the wastes till he came to the place where the
lady was, and seeing her standing at prayer utterly alone, waited till
she had made an end of her orisons, when he went up to her and
saluted her with the salam, saying, “Who art thou?” Quoth
she, “I am a hand-maid of the Almighty.” He asked, “What
doest thou in this desolate place?” and she answered, “I serve
Allah the Most High.” When he saw her beauty and loveliness,
he fell in love with her, and said to her, “Harkye! Do thou
take me to mate and I will be tender to thee and use thee
with exceeding ruth, and I will further thee in obedience to Allah
Almighty.” But she answered, saying, “I have no need of wedlock
and I desire to abide here alone with my Lord and His worship;
but an thou wouldst have ruth upon me and further me in the
obedience of Allah the Most High, carry me to a place where there
is water and thou wilt have done me a kindness.” Thereupon
he took her to a place wherein was running water and setting
her down on the ground, left her and went his ways, marvelling at
her. After he left her, he found his camels, by her blessing, and
when he returned, King Kisra asked him, “Hast thou found the
camels?” He answered “Yes,” and acquainted him with the
affair of the damsel, and detailed to him her beauty and loveliness:
whereupon the king’s heart clave to her and he mounted
with a few men and betook himself to that place, where he found
the lady and was amazed at her, because he saw her surpassing
the description wherewith the camel-driver had described her to
him. So he accosted her and said to her, “I am King Kisra,
greatest of the kings. Wilt thou not have me to husband?”
Quoth she, “What wilt thou do with me, O king, and I a woman
abandoned in the waste?” And quoth he, “Needs must this
be, and if thou wilt not consent to me, I will take up my abode
here and devote myself to Allah’s service and thy service, and
with thee worship the Almighty.” Then he bade set up for her a
tent and another for himself, facing hers, so he might adore Allah
with her, and fell to sending her food; and she said in herself,
“This is a king, and ’tis not lawful for me that I suffer him for
my sake to forsake his lieges and his land.” Presently she said
to the serving-woman, who used to bring her the food, “Speak
the king that he return to his women, for he hath no need of me,
and I desire to abide in this place, so I may worship therein
Allah the Most High.” The slave-girl returned to the king and
told him this, whereupon he sent back to her, saying, “I have no
need of the kingship and I also desire to tarry here and worship
Allah with thee in this waste.” When she found this earnestness
in him, she fell in with his wishes, and said, “O king, I will
consent to that which thou desirest and will be to thee a wife,
but on condition that thou bring me Dadbin the king and his
Wazir Kardan and his Chamberlain the chief Eunuch, and that
they be present in thine assembly, so I may speak a word with
them in thy presence, to the intent that thou mayst redouble in
affection for me.” Quoth Kisra, “And what is thy want unto
this?” So she related to him her story from first to last, how
she was the wife of Dadbin the king and how the Wazir Kardan
had misspoken of her honour. When King Kisra heard this, he
redoubled in love-longing for her and affection and said to her, “Do
whatso thou willest:” then he let bring a litter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5258" id="noteref-5258" epub:type="noteref">5258</a> and carrying her
therein to his dwelling-place, entreated her with the utmost honour
and espoused her. Presently he sent a great army to King
Dadbin and fetching him and his Wazir Kardan and the Eunuch-chamberlain,
caused bring them before him, they unknowing the
while what he might purpose to do with them. Moreover, he
caused set up for Arwa a pavilion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5259" id="noteref-5259" epub:type="noteref">5259</a> in the courtyard of his palace,
and she entered it and let down the curtain before herself.
When the servants had set their seats and they had seated themselves,
Arwa raised a corner of the curtain and said, “O Kardan,
rise to thy feet, for it besitteth not that thou sit in the like of
this assembly, before this mighty King Kisra.” When the Wazir
heard these words, his heart fluttered and his joints were loosened
and he rose to his feet of his fear. Then said she to him, “By the
virtue of Him who hath made thee stand up to judgment in this
standing-stead, and thou abject and humiliated, I conjure thee
speak the truth and say what egged thee on to lie against me and
drive me from my home and from the land of my husband and
made thee practise thus against a man and a Moslem so as to slay
him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5260" id="noteref-5260" epub:type="noteref">5260</a> This is no place wherein lying availeth nor may artifice be
herein.” When the Wazir was ’ware that she was Arwa and
heard her speech, he knew that it behoved him not to lie and that
naught would avail him save truth; so he bowed his head groundwards
and wept and said, “Whoso doth evil, needs must he incur
it, albe his day be prolonged. By Allah, I am he who hath
sinned and transgressed, and naught prompted me unto this but
fear and overmastering desire and the misery writ upon my brow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5261" id="noteref-5261" epub:type="noteref">5261</a>
And indeed this woman is pure and chaste and free from all fault.”
When King Dadbin heard this, he beat his face and said to
Kardan, his Wazir, “Allah slay thee!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5262" id="noteref-5262" epub:type="noteref">5262</a> ’Tis thou that hast
parted me and my wife and wronged me!” But Kisra the
king said to him, “Allah shall assuredly slay thee, because thou
hastenedst and lookedst not into thine affair, and knewest not
the guilty from the guiltless. Hadst thou wrought deliberately,
the unright had been made manifest to thee from the right; so
when this villain Wazir purposed thy ruin, where was thy judgment
and whither went thy sight?” Then he asked Arwa, “What
wilt thou that I do with them?” and she answered, “Accomplish
on them the ordinance of Almighty Allah:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5263" id="noteref-5263" epub:type="noteref">5263</a> let the slayer be
slain and the transgressor transgressed against, even as he transgressed
against us; yea, and to the well-doer weal shall be done
even as he did unto us.” So she gave her officers order concerning
Dadbin and they smote him on the head with a mace and slew him,
and she said, “This is for the slaughter of my sire.” Then she
bade set the Wazir on a beast and bear him to the desert whither
he had caused her to be borne, and leave him there without provaunt
or water; and she said to him, “An thou be guilty, thou
shalt suffer the punishment of thy guilt and die in the desert of
hunger and thirst; but an there be no guilt in thee, thou shalt be
delivered, even as I was delivered.” As for the Eunuch-chamberlain,
who had counselled King Dadbin not to slay her, but to
cause carry her to the desert, she bestowed on him a costly robe
of honour and said to him, “The like of thee it befitteth kings
to hold in favour and promote to high place, for that thou spakest
loyally and well, and a man is requited according to his deed.”
And Kisra the King made him Wali in a certain province of his
empire. “Know, therefore, O king” (continued the youth), “that
whoso doeth good is requited with good, and he who is guiltless
of sin and offence feareth not the issue of his affair. And I,
O my liege lord, am free from guilt, wherefore I hope in Allah
that He will show forth the truth to mine auspicious king, and
vouchsafe me the victory over enemies and enviers.” When the
king heard this, his wrath subsided and he said, “Return him
to the prison till the morrow, so we may look into his case.”</p>

<p class="c013">When it was the sixth day, the wrath of the Wazirs redoubled,
because they had not won their will of the youth and they feared
for their lives from the liege lord; so three of them went in to
him and prostrating themselves between his hands, said to him,
“O king, indeed we are loyal counsellors to thy dignity and fondly

youth alive and we know not what is thine advantage therein.
Every day findeth him yet on life and the talk of folk redoubleth
suspicion on thee; so do thou do him dead, that the talk may be

Allah, verily ye say sooth and speak rightly!” Then he bade
them bring the young treasurer and when he came into the
presence said to him, “How long shall I look into thy case, and
find no helper for thee and see them athirst for thy blood?” The
youth answered, “O king, I hope for succour only from Allah,
not from created beings: an He aid me, none shall have power to
harm me, and if He be with me and on my side, because of the
truth, from whom shall I fear, because of untruth? Indeed, I
have made my intent with Allah a pure intent and a sincere, and
I have severed my expectation from the help of the creature; and
whoso seeketh aid of Allah findeth of his desire that which
Bakhtzamán found.” Quoth the king, “Who was Bakhtzaman and
what is his story?” and quoth the youth, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF KING BAKHTZAMAN</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5264" id="noteref-5264" epub:type="noteref">5264</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a king of the kings, whose name was Bakhtzaman,
and he was a great eater and drinker and carouser. Now
enemies of his made their appearance in certain parts of his realm,
which they coveted; and one of his friends said to him, “O king,
the foe intendeth for thee: be on thy guard against him.” Quoth
Bakhtzaman, “I reck not of him, for that I have weapons and
wealth and warmen and am not afraid of aught.” Then said his
friends to him, “Ask aid of Allah, O king, for He will help thee
more than thy wealth and thy weapons and thy warriors.” But
he turned a deaf ear to the speech of his loyal counsellors, and
presently the enemy came upon him and waged war upon him and
got the victory over him and profited him naught his trust in
other than Allah the Most High. So he fled from him and seeking
one of the sovrans, said to him, “I come to thee and lay hold
upon thy skirts and take refuge with thee, so thou mayst help me
against my foe.” The king gave him money and men and a
mighty many and Bakhtzaman said in himself, “Now am I
fortified with this force and needs must I conquer my foe with
such combatants and overcome him;” but he said not, “With the
aid of Allah Almighty.” So his enemy met him and overcame him
again and he was defeated and put to the rout and fled at random:
his troops were dispersed from him and his money lost and the
enemy pursued him. Thereupon he sought the sea and passing
over to the other side, saw a great city and therein a mighty
citadel. He asked its name and that of its owner, and they said
to him, “It belongeth to Khadídán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5265" id="noteref-5265" epub:type="noteref">5265</a> the king.” So he fared on till
he came to the royal palace and concealing his condition, passed
himself off for a horseman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5266" id="noteref-5266" epub:type="noteref">5266</a> and sought service with King Khadidan,
who attached him to his attendance and entreated him with
honour; but his heart still clung to his mother-land and his
home. Presently, it chanced that an enemy came out against
King Khadidan; so he sent his troops to meet him and made
Bakhtzaman head of the host. Then they went forth to the field
and Khadidan also came forth and ranged his troops and levelled
lance and sallied out in person and fought a sore fight and
overcame his foe, who with his troops ignominiously fled. When
the king and his army returned in triumph, Bakhtzaman said to
him, “Harkye, O king! This be a strange thing I see in thee
that thou art compassed about with this mighty great army, yet
dost thou apply thyself in person to battle and adventurest thy
life.” Quoth the king, “Dost thou call thyself a knight and a
learned wight and deemest that victory is in the many of men?”
Quoth Bakhtzaman, “Such is indeed my belief.” And Khadidan
the king cried, “By Allah, then, thou errest in this thy belief!”
presently adding, “Woe and again woe to him whose trust is
in other than Allah! Indeed, this army is appointed only for
phantasy and majesty, and victory is from Allah alone. I too, O
Bakhtzaman, whilome believed that victory was in the number of
men,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5267" id="noteref-5267" epub:type="noteref">5267</a> and an enemy came out against me with eight hundred head,
whilst I had eight hundred thousand. I trusted in the tale of
my troops, whilst my foe trusted in Allah, so he defeated me and
routed me and I was put to a shameful flight and hid myself
in one of the mountains, where I met with a Religious who had
withdrawn himself from the world. So I joined myself to him and
complained to him of my case and acquainted him with all that had
befallen me. Quoth the Recluse, Wottest thou why this befel
thee and thou wast defeated? Quoth I, I know not; and he
said, Because thou didst put thy trust in the multitude of thy warmen
and reliedst not upon Allah the Most High. Hadst thou put
thy trust in the Almighty and believed of Him that it is He alone
who advantageth and endamageth thee, never had thy foe availed
to cope with thee. Return unto Allah. So I returned to my right
senses, and repented at the hands of that Religious, who said to me:—Turn
back with what remaineth to thee of troops and confront
thy foes, for, if their intents be changed and turned away from Allah,
thou wilt overcome them, e’en wert thou alone. When I heard the
Solitary’s words, I put my trust in Allah of All-Might; and,
gathering together those who remained with me, fell upon mine
enemies at unawares in the night. They deemed us many and
fled with the shamefullest flight, whereupon I entered my city
and repossessed myself of my place by the might of Almighty
Allah, and now I fight not but trusting in His aid.” When
Bakhtzaman heard these words he awoke from his heedlessness
and cried, “Extolled be the perfection of God the Great! O
king, this is my case and my story, nothing added and naught
subtracted, for I am King Bakhtzaman and all this happened to
me: wherefore I will seek the gate of Allah’s mercy and repent
unto Him.” So he went forth to one of the mountains and
worshipped Allah there awhile, till one night, as he slept,
a personage appeared to him in a dream and said to him,
“O Bakhtzaman, Allah accepteth thy repentance and openeth
on thee the door of succour and will aid thee against thy
foe.” When he was assured of this in the dream, he arose
and turned back, intending for his own city; and when he
drew near thereunto, he saw a company of the king’s retainers,
who said to him, “Whence art thou? We see that thou art a
foreigner and fear for thee from this king, for that every stranger
who entereth this city, he destroyeth him, of his dread of King
Bakhtzaman.” Said Bakhtzaman, “None shall prejudice him
nor profit him save Allah the Most High.” And they replied,
“Indeed, he hath a vast army and his heart is fortified in the
multitude of his many.” When King Bakhtzaman heard this, his
mind was comforted and he said to himself, “I place my trust in
Allah. An He will, I shall overcome mine enemy by the might of
the Lord of Omnipotence.” So he said to the folk, “Wot ye not
who I am?” and they said, “No, by Allah.” Cried he, “I
am King Bakhtzaman.” When they heard this and knew that it
was indeed he, they dismounted from their horses and kissed his
stirrup, to do him honour, and said to him, “O king, why thus
risk thy life?” Quoth he, “Indeed, my life is a light matter to
me and I set my trust in Almighty Allah, looking to Him
for protection.” And quoth they, “May that suffice thee!”
presently adding, “We will do with thee that which is in
our power and whereof thou art worthy: hearten thy heart,
for we will succour thee with our substance and our existence,
and we are his chief officers and the most in favour with him
of all folk. So we will take thee with us and cause the lieges
follow after thee, because the inclination of the people, all of them,
is thee-wards.” Said he, “Do whatso Allah Almighty enableth
you to do.” So they carried him into the city and hid him with
them. Then they agreed with a company of the king’s chief
officers, who had aforetime been those of Bakhtzaman, and acquainted
them with this; whereat they rejoiced with joy exceeding.
Then they assembled together to Bakhtzaman, and made a covenant
and handfast of fealty with him and fell upon the foe and
slew him and seated King Bakhtzaman again on the throne of his
kingship. And his affairs prospered and Allah amended his estate
and restored to him His bounty, and he ruled his subjects justly and
abode in the obedience of the Almighty. “On this wise, O king,”
(continued the young treasurer), “he with whom Allah is and
whose intent is pure, meeteth naught save good. As for me, I
have no helper other than the Almighty, and I am content to submit
myself to His ordinance, for that He knoweth the purity of
my intent.” With this the king’s wrath subsided and he said,
“Return him to the prison till the morrow, so we may look into
his case.”</p>

    <div>The Seventh Day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class="c012">OF CLEMENCY.</h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the seventh day, the seventh Wazir, whose name was
Bihkamál,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5268" id="noteref-5268" epub:type="noteref">5268</a> came in to the king and prostrating himself to him,
said, “O king, what doth thy long-suffering with this youth profit
thee? Indeed the folk talk of thee and of him. Why, then, dost
thou postpone the putting him to death?” The Minister’s words
aroused the anger of the king, and he bade bring the youth. So
they fetched him before, him in fetters, and Azadbakht said to
him, “Ho, woe to thee! By Allah, after this day there abideth
no deliverance for thee from my hand, by reason that thou hast
outraged mine honour, and there can be no forgiveness for thee.”
The youth replied, “O king, there is no great forgiveness save in
case of a great default, for according as the offence is great in so
much magnified is mercy; and it is no grace to the like of thee if
he spare the like of me. Verily, Allah knoweth that there is no
crime in me, and indeed He commandeth to clemency, and no
clemency is greater than that which spareth from slaughter, for
that thy pardon of him whom thou purposest to put to death
is as the quickening of a dead man; and whoso doth evil shall find
it before him, even as it was with King Bihkard.” Asked the
king, “And what is the story of King Bihkard?” And the youth
answered, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF KING BIHKARD</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5269" id="noteref-5269" epub:type="noteref">5269</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a king named Bihkard and he had mickle of
wealth and many troops; but his deeds were evil and he would
punish for a slight offence, and he never forgave any offender.
He went forth one day to hunt and a certain of his pages shot a
shaft, which lit on the king’s ear and cut it off. Bihkard cried,
“Who shot that arrow?” So the guards brought him in haste the
misdemeanant, whose name was Yatrú,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5270" id="noteref-5270" epub:type="noteref">5270</a> and he of his fear fell
down on the ground in a fainting fit. Then quoth the king, “Slay
him;” but Yatru said, “O king, this which hath befallen was not
of my choice nor of my knowledge; so do thou pardon me, in the
hour of thy power over me, for that mercy is of the goodliest of
deeds and belike it shall be in this world a provision and a good
work for which thou shalt be repaid one of these days, and a
treasure laid up to thine account with Allah in the world to come.
Pardon me, therefore, and fend off evil from me, so shall Allah fend
off from thee the like evil.” When the king heard this, it pleased
him and he pardoned the page, albeit he had never before pardoned
any. Now this page was of the sons of the kings and
had fled from his sire on account of a sin he had committed: then
he went and took service with Bihkard the king, and there happened
to him what happened. After a while, it chanced that a man
recognized him and went and told his father, who sent him a letter,
comforting his heart and mind and calling upon him to return to
him. Accordingly he returned to his father, who came forth to
meet him and rejoiced in him, and the Prince’s affairs were set
right with his sire. Now it befel, one day of the days, that king
Bihkard shipped him in a ship and put out to sea, so he might
fish: but the wind blew on them and the craft sank. The king
made the land upon a plank, unknown of any, and came forth,
mother-naked, on one of the coasts; and it chanced that he landed
in the country whereof the father of the page aforesaid was king.
So he came in the night to the gate of the sovran’s capital, and
finding it shut, lodged him in a burying-place there. When the
morning morrowed and the folk came forth of the city, behold,
they found a man lately murthered and cast down in a corner of
the burial ground, and seeing Bihkard there, doubted not but it
was he who had slain him during the night; so they laid hands
on him and carried him up to the king and said to him, “This
fellow hath slain a man.” The king bade imprison him; whereupon
they threw him in jail, and he fell to-saying in himself, what
while he was in the prison, “All that hath befallen me is of the
abundance of my sins and my tyranny, for, indeed, I have slain much
people unrighteously and this is the requital of my deeds and that
which I have wrought whilome of oppression.” As he was thus
pondering in himself, there came a bird and lighted down on the
pinnacle of the prison, whereupon, of his passing eagerness in the
chase, he took a stone and threw it at the bird. Now the king’s
son was playing in the exercise-ground with the ball and the bat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5271" id="noteref-5271" epub:type="noteref">5271</a>
and the stone lit on his ear and cut it off, whereupon the Prince
fell down in a fit. So they enquired who had thrown the stone
and finding that it was Bihkard, took him and carried him before
the king’s son, who bade do him die. Accordingly, they cast the
turband from his head and were about to fillet his eyes, when the
Prince looked at him and seeing him cropped of an ear, said to
him, “But for thy villainies thine ear had not been cut off.”
Said Bihkard, “Not so, by Allah! Nay, but the story of the
loss of my car is so and so, and I pardoned him who smote me
with an arrow and cut off my ear.” When the prince heard this,
he looked in his face and knowing him, cried out and said, “Art
thou not Bihkard the king?” “Yes,” replied he, and the Prince
said to him, “What ill chance threw thee here?” Thereupon he
told him all that had betided him and the folk wondered and
extolled the perfection of the Almighty, crying “Subhána ’llah!—laud
to the Lord!” Then the Prince rose to him and embraced
him and kissed him and, entreating him with respect, seated
him in a chair and bestowed on him a robe of honour; and
he turned to his sire and said to him, “This be the king who
pardoned me and this be his ear which I cut off with a
shaft; and indeed he deserveth my pardon by having pardoned
me.” Then said he to Bihkard, “Verily, the issue of mercy hath
been a provision for thee in such hour as this.” And they entreated
him with the utmost kindness and sent him back to his own
country in all honour. “Know, then, O king” (continued the
youth), “that there is no goodlier quality than mercy and that all
thou dost of clemency, thou shalt find before thee a treasure for
thee treasured up.” When the king heard this, his wrath subsided
and he said, “Return him to the prison till the morrow, so we may
look into his case.”</p>

    <div>The Eighth Day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class="c012">OF ENVY AND MALICE.</h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the eighth day, the Wazirs all assembled and had
speech together and said, “How shall we do with this youth, who
overcometh us with his much talk? Indeed, we fear lest he be
saved and we fall into destruction. So, let us all go in to the king
and unite our efforts to gain our cause, ere he appear without guilt
and come forth and get the better of us.” Accordingly they all
went in to the king and prostrating themselves before him, said to
him, “O king, beware lest this youth ensorcell thee with his
sorcery and beguile thee with his wiles. An thou heardest what
we hear, thou wouldst not suffer him live; no, not a single day.
Wherefore heed not his speech, for we are thy Ministers, who
endeavour for thy permanence, and if thou hearken not to our word,
to whose word wilt thou hearken? See, we are ten Wazirs who
testify against this youth that he is guilty and entered not the
king’s sleeping chamber save with ill intent, so he might put the
king to shame and outrage his honour; and if the king slay him
not, let him banish him his realm, that the tongue of the folk may
desist from him.” When the king heard his Ministers’ words, he
was wroth with exceeding wrath and bade bring the youth, and
when he came in to the king, the Wazirs all cried out with one
voice, saying, “O Lack-wits, thinkest thou to save thyself from
slaughter by guile and sleight, that thou wilest the king with thy
talk and hopest pardon for the like of this mighty great crime thou
hast committed?” Then the king bade fetch the sworder, so he
might smite his neck; whereupon each of the Wazirs fell to saying,
“I will slay him;” and they sprang upon him. Quoth the
youth, “O king, consider and ponder the eagerness of these thy
Ministers. Is this of envy or is it not? They would fain make severance
between me and thee, so there may fall to them what they
shall plunder, as aforetime.” And the king said to him, “Consider
their witness against thee.” The young man said, “O king, how
shall they testify of that which they saw not?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5272" id="noteref-5272" epub:type="noteref">5272</a> This is but envy
and despight; and thou, an thou slay me, wilt indeed regret me,
and I fear lest there betide thee of repentance that which betided
Aylán Sháh, by reason of the malice of his Wazirs.” Asked
Azadbakht, “And what is his story?” and the youth answered,
“Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF AYLAN SHAH AND ABU TAMMAM</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5273" id="noteref-5273" epub:type="noteref">5273</a></h4>

<p class="c013">Whilome there was a merchant named Abu Tammám, and he
was a clever man and a well-bred, quick-witted and truthful in all
his affairs, and he was monied to boot. Now there was in his land
a king as unjust as he was jealous, and Abu Tammam feared for
his wealth from this king and said, “I will remove hence to
another place where I shall not be in dread.” So he made for the
city of Aylán Sháh and built himself a palace therein and transporting
his wealth thither, took up his abode there. Presently, the
news of him reached King Aylan Shah; so he sent to invite him
to his presence and said to him, “We know of thy coming to us
and thine entering under our allegiance, and indeed we have heard
of thine excellence and wit and generosity; so welcome to thee
and fair welcome! The land is thy land and at thy command, and
whatsoever need thou needest of us, ’tis already accomplished to
thee; and it behoveth that thou be near our person and of our
assembly.” Abu Tammam  prostrated himself before the king,
and said to him, “O king, I will serve thee with my monies and
with my life, but do thou excuse me from nearness to thee, for that
an I took office about thee, I should not be safe from enemies and
enviers.” Then he applied himself to the royal service with
presents and largesses, and the king saw him to be intelligent, well-bred
and of good counsel; so his heart inclined to him and he
committed to him the ordinance of his affairs and the power to bind
and to loose was in his hand. Now Aylan Shah had three Wazirs,
in whose hands public affairs were wont to be and they had been
accustomed not to quit the king night or day; but they became shut
out from him by reason of Abu Tammam and the king was occupied
with him to their exclusion. Herewith the Ministers took counsel
together upon the matter and said, “What is your rede we should
do, seeing that the king is occupied from us with yonder man, and
indeed he honoureth him with more honour than us? But now
come, let us devise some device whereby we may alienate him
from the king.” So each of them spoke forth that which was in
his mind, and one of them said, “The king of the Turks hath a
daughter, whose like there is not in the world, and whatso
messenger goeth to demand her in marriage, him her father
slaughtereth. Now our king hath no knowledge of this; so, come,
let us foregather with him and bring up the mention of her: when
his heart is taken with her, we will advise him to dispatch Abu
Tammam to seek her hand in marriage; whereupon her father
will slay him and we shall be quit of him and settle his affair once
for all.” Accordingly, they went in to the king one day (Abu
Tammam being present among them,) and mentioned the affair of
the damsel, the daughter of the Turks’ king, and enlarged upon
her charms, till the king’s heart was taken with her and he said to
them, “We will send one to demand her to wife for us; but who
shall be our messenger?” Quoth the Wazirs, “There is none fit
for this business but Abu Tammam, by reason of his wit and good
breeding;” and the king said, “Indeed, even as ye say, none is
fitting for this affair save he.” Then he turned to Abu Tammam
and said to him, “Wilt thou not go with my message and seek
me in marriage the daughter of the Turks’ king?” and he
answered, “To hear is to obey, O my Sovran!” So they made
ready his affair and the king conferred on him a robe of honour,
and he took with him a present and a letter under the king’s hand
and setting out, fared on till he came to the capital city of
Turkistan. When the king of the Turks knew of his coming, he
despatched his officers to receive him and entreated him with
honour and lodged him as befitted his rank. Then he guested him
three days, after which time he summoned him to his presence and
Abu Tammam went in to him; and, prostrating himself as beseemeth
before kings, laid that present before him and gave him the letter.
The king read the writ and said to Abu Tammam, “We will do
what behoveth in the matter; but, O Abu Tammam, needs must
thou view my daughter and she view thee, and needs must thou
hear her speech and she hear thine.” So saying, he sent him to
the lodging of the Princess, who had had notice of this; so that
they had adorned her sitting-room with the costliest that might be
of vessels of gold and silver and the like, and she seated herself on
a chair of gold, clad in the richest of royal robes and ornaments.
When Abu Tammam entered, he took thought and said, “The
wise declare that whoso governeth his sight shall suffer naught unright
and he who guardeth his tongue shall hear naught of foul
taunt, and he who keepeth watch over his hand, it shall be
lengthened and not shortened.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5274" id="noteref-5274" epub:type="noteref">5274</a> So he entered and seating himself
on the floor, cast down his eyes and covered his hands and
feet with his dress.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5275" id="noteref-5275" epub:type="noteref">5275</a> Quoth the king’s daughter to him, “Raise
thy head, O Abu Tammam, and look on me and speak with me.”
But he spake not neither raised his head, and she continued, “They
sent thee only to view me and talk with me, and yet behold thou
sayest not a word;” presently adding, “Take of these union-pearls
that be round thee and of these jewels and gold and silver.”
But he put not forth his hand to aught, and when she saw that he
paid no heed to anything, she was angry and cried, “They have
messaged me with a messenger, blind, dumb, deaf.” Then she
sent to acquaint her father with this; whereupon the king called
Abu Tammam to him and said to him, “Thou camest not save to
view my daughter: why, then, hast thou not looked upon her?”
Quoth Abu Tammam, “I saw everything;” and quoth the king,
“Why didst thou not take somewhat of that which thou sawest
of jewels and the like? Indeed they were set out for thee.” But he
answered, “It behoveth me not to put out my hand to aught that
is not mine.” When the king heard his speech, he gave him a
sumptuous robe of honour and loved him muchly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5276" id="noteref-5276" epub:type="noteref">5276</a> and said to him,
“Come, look at this well.” So Abu Tammam went up to the pit-mouth
and looked, and behold, it was full of heads of the sons of
Adam, and the king said to him, “These are the heads of envoys
whom I slew, because I saw them without loyalty to their lords,
and I was used, whenas I beheld an envoy without good
manners, to say, He who sent him is worse-mannered than he,
because the messenger is the tongue of him who sendeth him
and his breeding is of his master’s breeding; and whoso is after
this fashion, it befitteth not that he be akin to me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5277" id="noteref-5277" epub:type="noteref">5277</a> For this
reason I used to put the envoys to death; but, as for thee,
thou hast overcome us and won my daughter, of the excellence
of thy manners; so hearten thy heart, for she is thy lord’s.” Then
he sent him back to King Aylan Shah with presents and rarities
and a letter, saying, “This that I have done is in honour of thee
and of thine envoy.” When Abu Tammam returned after accomplishing
his mission and brought the presents and the letter, King
Aylan Shah rejoiced in this and redoubled all his favours
and showed him honour the highest. Some days after, the
King of Turkistan sent his daughter and she went in to King
Aylan Shah, who rejoiced in her with exceeding joy and Abu
Tammam’s worth was exalted in the royal sight. When the
Wazirs saw this, they redoubled in envy and despite and said, “An
we contrive us not a contrivance to rid us of this man, we shall
die of rage.” So they bethought them and agreed upon a device
they should practise. Then they betook themselves to two boys,
pages affected to the service of the king, who slept not but on
their knee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5278" id="noteref-5278" epub:type="noteref">5278</a> and they lay at his head, for that they were his bedchamber
pages. So the Ministers gave them each a thousand
dinars of gold, saying, “We desire of you that ye do somewhat we
require and take this gold as a provision against your time of
need.” Quoth the lads, “What is it ye would have us do?” and
quoth the Wazirs, “This Abu Tammam hath marred matters for us,
and if his case abide in this way, he will remove us all from the
king’s favour; and what we want of you twain is that, when ye
are alone with the king and he leaneth back, as he were asleep, one
of you say to his fellow:—Verily, the king hath taken Abu
Tammam into high favour and hath advanced him to exalted rank,
yet he is a transgressor against the king’s honour and an accursed
wight. Then let the other of you ask:—And what is his transgression?
and let the first answer:—He outrageth the king’s
honour and saith, the King of Turkistan was used, when a
messenger went to him to seek his daughter in marriage, to slay
him; but me he spared, because she liked me, and by reason of
this her sire sent her hither, for that she loved me. Then let the
other say, Knowest thou this for truth? and let the first reply:—By
Allah, this is familiar to all the folk, but, of their fear of the king,
they dare not divulge it to him; and as often as the king is absent
a-hunting or a-wayfaring, Abu Tammam cometh to her and is
private with her.” Whereupon the boys answered, “We will say
this.” Accordingly, one night, when they were alone with the
king and he leant back, as he were asleep, they said these words
and the king heard all and was like to die of fury and despite
and said to himself, “These are young boys, not come to years of
discretion, and have no business with any; and unless they had
heard these words from some one, they had not spoken thereof
each with other.” When it was morning wrath overmastered him,
so that he stayed not neither deliberated, but summoned Abu
Tammam and taking him apart, said to him, “Whoso guardeth not
the honour of his liege lord<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5279" id="noteref-5279" epub:type="noteref">5279</a>, what deserveth he?” Said Abu
Tammam, “He deserveth that his lord guard not <i>his</i> honour.”
Aylan Shah continued, “And whoso entereth the king’s house and
playeth traitor with him, what behoveth unto him?” and Abu
Tammam replied, “He shall not be left alive.” Whereupon the
king spat in his face and said to him, “Both these deeds hast <i>thou</i>
done.” Then he drew his poinard on him in haste and smiting
him in the belly, slit it and Abu Tammam died forthright; whereupon
the king dragged him along and cast him into a well that
was in his palace. After he had slain him, he fell into repentance
and mourning increased and chagrin waxed sore upon him, and
he would acquaint none who questioned him with the cause, nor,
of his love for his wife, did he tell her of this, and whenever she
asked him wherefore he grieved, he answered her not. When the
Wazirs knew of Abu Tammam’s death, they rejoiced with exceeding
joy and knew that the king’s sorrow arose from regret for
him. As for Aylan Shah, after this he used to betake himself by
night to the sleeping-chamber of the two boys and spy upon them,
that he might hear what they said concerning his wife. As he
stood one night privily at the door of their chamber, he saw them
spread out the gold between their hands and play with it and
heard one of them say, “Woe to us! What doth this gold profit
us? Indeed we cannot buy therewith any thing nor spend it
upon ourselves. Nay, but we have sinned against Abu Tammam
and done him dead unjustly.” And said the other, “Had we
known that the king would slay him on the spot, we had not done
what we did.” When the king heard that, he could not contain
himself, but rushed in upon them and said to them, “Woe to you!
What did ye? Tell me.” And they cried, “Amán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5280" id="noteref-5280" epub:type="noteref">5280</a>, O king!”
He cried, “An ye would have pardon from Allah and me, you are
bound to tell me the truth, for nothing shall save you from me but
soothfastness.” Hereat they prostrated themselves before him and
said, “By Allah, O king, the Wazirs gave us this gold and taught
us to lie against Abu Tammam, so thou mightest kill him, and
what we said was their speech.” When the king heard this, he
plucked at his beard, till he was like to tear it up by the roots and
bit upon his fingers, till he well nigh cut them in twain, for repentance
and sorrow that he had wrought hastily and had not delayed
with Abu Tammam, so he might consider his case. Then he sent
for the Ministers and said to them, “O villainous Wazirs, ye
deemed that Allah was heedless of your deed, but right soon shall
your wickedness revert upon you. Know ye not that Whoso
diggeth for his brother a pit shall himself fall into it?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5281" id="noteref-5281" epub:type="noteref">5281</a> Take from
me the punishment of this world and to-morrow ye shall receive
the punishment of the next world and requital from Allah.” Then
he bade put them to death; so the headsman smote off their heads
before the king, and he went in to his wife and acquainted her
with whatso he had misdone to Abu Tammam; whereupon she
grieved for him with mighty great grief and the king and his
household ceased not weeping and repenting all their lives. Moreover,
they brought Abu Tammam forth of the well and the king
built him a dome<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5282" id="noteref-5282" epub:type="noteref">5282</a> in his palace and buried him therein. “See, then,
O auspicious king” (continued the youth), “what jealousy doth
and injustice and how Allah caused the Wazirs’ malice to revert
upon their own necks; and I trust in the Almighty that He will
empower me over all who envy me my favour with the king and
show forth the truth unto him. Indeed, I dread naught for my
life from death; only I fear lest the king repent of my slaughter,
for that I am guiltless of offence, and if I knew that I were guilty
on any wise, my tongue would be dumb-struck.” When the king
heard this, he bowed his head groundwards in perplexity and confusion
and said, “Restore him to the prison till the morrow, so we
may look into his case.”</p>

    <div>The Ninth Day.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class="c012">OF DESTINY OR THAT WHICH IS WRITTEN ON THE FOREHEAD.</h3>

<p class="c013">Now when it was the ninth day, the Wazirs met and said one to
other, “Verily, this youth baffleth us, for as often as the king is
minded to kill him, he beguileth him and bewitcheth him with a
story; so what be your rede we should do, that we may slay him
and be at rest from him?” Then they advised together and
agreed that they should go to the king’s wife.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5283" id="noteref-5283" epub:type="noteref">5283</a> So they betook
themselves to her and said to her, “Thou art careless of this affair
wherein thou art and this uncare shall not profit thee; whilst the
king, occupied with eating and drinking and diversion, forgetteth
that the folk beat upon tambourines and sing of thee and
say, The wife of king loveth the youth; and as long as he abideth
alive the talk will increase and not diminish.” Quoth she, “By
Allah, ’twas ye egged me on against him, and what shall I do
now?” and quoth they, “Go thou in to the king and weep and
say to him,—Verily, the women come to me and inform me that I
am dishonoured throughout the city, and what is thine advantage
in the sparing of this youth? An thou wilt not slay him, slay me
to the end that this talk may be cut off from us.” So the woman arose
and rending her raiment, went in to the king, in the presence of the
Wazirs, and cast herself upon him, saying, “O king, is my shame
not upon thee or fearest thou not shame? Indeed, this is not of
the fashion of kings that their jealousy over their women should
be such as this.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5284" id="noteref-5284" epub:type="noteref">5284</a> Thou art heedless and all the folk of the realm
prate of thee, men and women. Either slay him, that the talk may
be cut off, or slay me, if thy soul will not consent to his slaughter.”
Thereupon the king’s wrath waxed hot and he said to her, “I have
no pleasure in his continuance and needs must I slay him this
very day. So return to thy palace and solace thy heart.” Then
he bade fetch the youth; whereupon they brought him before
him and the Wazirs said, “O base of base, fie upon thee!
Thy life-term is at hand and earth hungereth for thy flesh, so it
may make a meal of it.” But he said to them, “Death is not in
your word or in your envy; nay, it is a destiny written upon the
forehead: wherefore, if aught be writ upon my front, there is no
help but it come to pass, and neither striving nor thought-taking
nor precaution-seeking shall deliver me therefrom; even as happened
to King Ibrahim and his son.” Quoth the king, “Who was
King Ibrahim and who was his son?” and quoth the youth
“Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF KING IBRAHIM AND HIS SON</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5285" id="noteref-5285" epub:type="noteref">5285</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a king of the kings, Sultan Ibrahim hight, to
whom the sovrans abased themselves and did obedience; but he
had no son and was straitened of breast because of that, fearing
lest the kingship go forth of his hand. He ceased not to long for
a son and to buy slave-girls and lie with them, till one of them
conceived, whereat he rejoiced with passing joy and gave great
gifts and the largest largesse. When the girl’s months were complete
and the time of her lying-in drew near, the king summoned
the astrologers and they watched for the hour of child-bearing
and raised their astrolabes and carefully noted the time. The
hand-maid gave birth to a man-child, whereat the king rejoiced
exceedingly, and the people congratulated one another with this
glad news. Then the astrophils made their calculations and looked
into his nativity and his ascendant, whereupon their colour changed
and they were confounded. Quoth the king to them, “Acquaint
me with his horoscope and ye shall have assurance of pardon and
have naught to fear.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5286" id="noteref-5286" epub:type="noteref">5286</a> They replied, “O king, this princely
child’s nativity denoteth that, in the seventh year of his age, there
is fearful danger for him from a lion, which shall attempt to rend
him: and if he be saved from the lion, there will betide a matter
yet sorer and more grievous even than that.” Asked the king,
“What is it?” and they answered, “We will not speak, except
the king command us and give us assurance from fear.” Quoth
the king, “Allah assure you!” and quoth they, “An he be
saved from the lion, the king’s destruction shall be at his hand.”
When the king heard this, his complexion changed and his breast
was straitened; but he said to himself, “I will be watchful and do
my endeavour and suffer not the lion to eat him. It cannot be
that he will kill me, and indeed ‘The astrologers lied.’”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5287" id="noteref-5287" epub:type="noteref">5287</a> Then
he caused rear him among the wet-nurses and the noble matrons;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5288" id="noteref-5288" epub:type="noteref">5288</a>
but withal he ceased not to ponder the prediction of the astrophils
and verily his life was troubled. So he betook himself to the
top of a high mountain and hollowed there a deep excavation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5289" id="noteref-5289" epub:type="noteref">5289</a>
and made in it many dwelling-places and rooms and filled it with
all that was needful of rations and raiment and what not else and
laid in it pipe-conduits of water from the mountain and lodged
the boy therein, with a nurse who should rear him. Moreover, at
the first of each month he used to go to the mountain and stand
at the mouth of the hollow and let down a rope he had with him
and draw up the boy to him and strain him to his bosom and kiss
him and play with him awhile, after which he would let him down
again to his place and return; and he was wont to count the days
till the seven years should pass by. Now when arrived the time of
the Fate foreordered and the Fortune graven on the forehead and
there remained for the boy but ten days till the seven years
should be complete, there came to that mountain hunters chasing
wild beasts and, seeing a lion, they attacked him. He fled from
them and seeking refuge in the mountain, fell into the hollow in its
midst. The nurse saw him forthwith and escaped from him into
one of the chambers; upon which the lion made for the lad
and seizing upon him, tare his shoulder, after which he sought the
room wherein was the nurse and falling upon her, devoured her,
whilst the boy lay in a swoon. Meanwhile, when the huntsmen
saw that the lion had fallen into the pit, they came to the mouth
and heard the shrieking of the boy and the woman; and after
awhile the cries died away, whereby they knew that the lion had
slain them. Presently, as they stood by the mouth of the excavation
behold, the lion came scrambling up the sides and would have
issued forth: but, as often as he showed his head, they pelted him
with stones, till they beat him down and he fell; whereupon one
of the hunters descended into the pit and despatched him and
saw the boy wounded; after which he went to the chamber, where
he found the woman dead, and indeed the lion had eaten his fill of
her. Then he noted that which was therein of clothes and what
not else, and notifying his mates, fell to passing the stuff up to
them: lastly, he took up the boy and bringing him forth of the
pit, carried him to their dwelling-place, where they dressed
his wounds. He grew up with them, but acquainted them
not with his affair; and indeed, when they questioned him, he
knew not what he should say, because they let him down into
the pit when he was a little one. The hunters marvelled at his speech
and loved him with exceeding love and one of them took him to
son and abode rearing him by his side and training him in hunting
and horse-riding, till he reached the age of twelve and became a
brave, going forth with the folk to the chase and to the cutting of
the way. Now it chanced one day that they sallied forth to stop the
road and fell in with a caravan during the night: but its stout
fellows were on their guard; so they joined battle with the robbers
and overcame them and slew them and the boy fell wounded and
tarried cast down in that place till the morrow, when he opened
his eyes and finding his comrades slain, lifted himself up and
arose to walk the road. Presently, there met him a man, a treasure-seeker,
and asked him, “Whither away, O lad?” So he told
him what had betided him and the other said, “Be of good heart,
for that the tide of thy good fortune is come and Allah bringeth
thee joy and gladness. I am one who am in quest of a hidden
treasure, wherein is a mighty mickle of wealth. So come with me
that thou mayst help me, and I will give thee monies with which thou
shalt provide thyself all thy life long.” Then he carried the youth
to his dwelling and dressed his wounds, and he tarried with him
some days till he was rested; when the treasure-seeker took him
and two beasts and all that he needed, and they fared on till they
came to a towering highland. Here the man brought out a book
and reading therein, dug in the crest of the mountain five cubits
deep, whereupon there appeared to him a stone. He pulled it up
and behold it was a trap-door covering the mouth of a pit. So
he waited till the foul air<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5290" id="noteref-5290" epub:type="noteref">5290</a> was come forth from the midst of the
pit, when he bound a rope about the lad’s middle and let him down
bucket-wise to the bottom, and with him a lighted waxen taper.
The boy looked and beheld, at the upper end of the pit, wealth
abundant; so the treasure-seeker let down a rope and a basket
and the boy fell to filling and the man to drawing up, till the
fellow had got his sufficiency, when he loaded his beasts and ceased
working, whilst the boy looked for him to let down the rope and
draw him up; but he rolled a great stone to the mouth of the pit
and went his ways. When the boy saw what the treasure-seeker
had done with him, he relied upon Allah (extolled and exalted be
He!) and abode perplexed concerning his case and said, “How
bitter be this death?” for indeed the world was darkened on him
and the pit was blinded to him. So he fell a-weeping and saying,
“I escaped the lion and the robbers and now is my death to be in
this pit, where I shall die by slow degrees.” And he abode perplexed
and looked for nothing but death. But as he stood pondering,
behold, he heard a sound of water rushing with a thunderous
noise; so he arose and walked in the pit, following the
sound, till he came to a corner and heard the mighty coursing
of water. Then he laid his ear to the sound of the current and
hearing it rushing in great strength, said to himself, “This is the
flowing of a mighty watercourse and needs must I depart life in
this place, be it to-day or to-morrow; so I will throw myself into
the stream and not die a slow death in this pit.” Thereupon he
called up his courage and gathering up his skirts, cast himself
into the water, and it bore him along with force exceeding and
carrying him under the earth, stayed not till it brought him out into a
deep Wady, adown which ran a great river, that welled up from under
the ground. When he found himself on the face of earth, he abode
dazed and aswoon all that day; after which he came to himself
and rising, fared on along that valley; and he ceased not his wayfare,
praising Almighty Allah the while, till he came to an inhabited
land and a great village in the reign of the king his sire. So he
entered and foregathered with the villagers, who questioned him
of his case; whereupon he told them his tale, and they admired
how Allah had delivered him from all those dangers. Then he took
up his abode with them and they loved him much. On this wise
happened it to him; but as regards the king, his father, when he
went to the pit, as was his wont, and called the nurse, she returned
him no answer, whereat his breast was straitened and he let
down a man who found the woman dead and the boy gone and
acquainted therewith the king, who when he heard this, buffeted
his head and wept with sore weeping and descended into the midst
of the pit that he might see how the case stood. There he espied
the nurse slain and the lion dead, but beheld not the boy; so he
returned and acquainted the astrologers with the soothfastness of
their saying, and they replied, “O King, the lion hath eaten him;
destiny hath been wroughten upon him and thou art delivered
from his hand; for, had he been saved from the lion, we indeed, by
Allah, had feared for thee from him, because the king’s destruction
would have been at his hand.” So the king ceased to sorrow for
this and the days passed by and the affair was forgotten. Meanwhile
the boy grew up and abode with the people of the village, and
when Allah willed the accomplishing of His commandment, which
no endeavour availeth to avert, he went forth with a party of
the villagers to cut the way. The folk complained to King
Ibrahim his father, who sallied out with a company of his men
and surrounded the highwaymen. Now that boy was with them,
and he drew forth an arrow and launched it at them, and it
smote the king and wounded him in a mortal place. So they
carried him to his palace, after they had laid hands upon the
youth and his comrades and brought them before the sovran,
saying, “What biddest us to do with them?” Quoth he, “I am
presently in trouble for myself, so bring me the astrologers.”
Accordingly, they brought them before him and he said to them,
“Ye said to me Thy death shall be by slaying at the hand of thy
son: how, then, befalleth it that I have got my death-hurt by
yonder thieves?” The astrologers marvelled and said to him. “O
king, ’tis not beyond the lore of the stars, together with the doom
of Allah, that he who hath smitten thee should be thy son.” When
King Ibrahim heard this, he bade fetch the thieves and said to
them, “Tell me truly, which of you shot the shaft that wounded
me.” Said they, “’Twas this youth that is with us.” Whereupon
the king fell to considering him and said, “O youth, acquaint
me with thy case and tell me who was thy father and thou shalt
have assurance of safety from Allah.” The youth replied, “O my
lord, I know no father; as for me, my father lodged me in a pit,
with a nurse to rear me, and one day, there fell in upon us a lion,
which tare my shoulder, then left me and occupied himself with
the nurse and rent her in pieces; and Allah vouchsafed me one
who brought me forth the pit.” Then he related to him all that
had befallen him, first and last; which when King Ibrahim heard,
he cried out and said, “By Allah, this is my son!” presently
adding, “Bare thy shoulder.” So he uncovered it, and behold, it
was scarred. Then the king assembled his lords and lieges and
the astrologers and said to them, “Know that what Allah hath
writ upon the forehead, be it fair fortune or misfortune, none
may efface, and all that is decreed to a man must perforce befal
him. Indeed, this my care-taking and my endeavour profited me
naught, for what weird Allah decreed for my son, he hath dreed and
whatso He decreed to me I have endured. Nevertheless, I praise
Allah and thank Him because this was at my son’s hand, and not
at the hand of another, and Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord—for
that the kingship is come to my son!” And he strained the
youth to his bosom and embraced him and kissed him, saying
“O my son, this matter was after such fashion, and of my watchfulness
over thee from Fate, I lodged thee in that pit; but care-taking
availed not.” Then he took the crown of the kingship and set it
on his son’s head and caused the lieges and the people do homage
to him and commended the subjects to his care and enjoined to him
justice and equity. And he farewelled him that night and died
and his son reigned in his stead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5291" id="noteref-5291" epub:type="noteref">5291</a> “On like wise, O king” (continued
the young treasurer), “’tis with thee. If Allah have written
aught on my forehead, needs must it befal me and my speech to
the king shall not avail me; no, nor my illustrating it to him with
instances, against the doom of Allah. And so it is with these Wazirs,
for all their eagerness and endeavour for my destruction, this shall
not profit them; because, if Allah determine to save me, He will
give me the victory over them.” When the king heard these words
he became perplexed and said, “Return him to the prison till the
morrow, so we may look into his affair, for the day draweth to
an end and I mean to do him dead in foulest sort, and to-morrow
we will visit him with that which he meriteth.”</p>

<p class="c013">When it was the tenth day (now this day was called Al-Mihrján<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5293" id="noteref-5293" epub:type="noteref">5293</a>
and it was the day of the coming in of the folk, gentle and simple,
to the king, so they might give him joy and salute him and go
forth), the council of the Wazirs agreed that they should speak
with a company of the city notables. So they said to them,
“When ye go in to-day to the king and salute him, do ye say to
him:—O king, (to the Lord be the laud!) thou art praiseworthy of
policy and procedure and just to all thy subjects; but respecting
this youth whom thou hast favoured and who nevertheless hath
reverted to his base origin and done this foul deed, what is thy
purpose in his continuance? Indeed, thou hast prisoned him in thy
palace, and every day thou hearest his palaver and thou knowest not
what the folk say.” And they answered, “Hearing is obeying.”
Accordingly, when they entered with the folk and had prostrated
themselves before the king and congratulated his majesty, he raised
their several degrees. Now it was the custom of the folk to salute
and go forth; but they took seat, and the king knew that they had
a word they would fain address to him: so he turned to them (the
Wazirs being also present) and said, “Ask your need.” Therefore
they repeated to him all that the Ministers had taught them
and the Wazirs also spoke with them; and Azadbakht said to
them, “O folk, I would have it known to you that there is no doubt
with me concerning this your speech proceeding from love and
loyal counsel to me, and ye ken that, were I inclined to kill half
these folk, I could do them die and this would not be hard to me;
so how shall I not slay this youth and he in my power and in the
hending of my hand? Indeed, his crime is manifest and he hath
incurred death penalty; and I have deferred it only by reason of
the greatness of the offence; for, an I do this with him and my
proof against him be strengthened, my heart is healed and the
heart of my whole folk; and if I slay him not to-day, his slaying
shall not escape me to-morrow.” Then he bade fetch the youth
who, when present between his hands, prostrated to him and
blessed him; whereupon quoth the king, “Woe to thee! How
long shall the folk upbraid me on thine account and blame me for
delaying thy death? Even the people of my city reproach me
because of thee, so that I am grown a prating-stock amongst them,
and indeed they come in to me and reproach me for not putting
thee to death. How long shall I delay this? Verily, this very
day I mean to shed thy blood and rid the folk of thy prattling.”
The youth replied, “O king, an there have betided thee talk
because of me, by Allah, and again by Allah the Great, those who
have brought on thee this talk from the folk are none but these
wicked Wazirs, who chatter with the crowd and tell them foul tales
and ill things of the king’s house, but I hope in the Most High
that He will cause their malice to recoil upon their own heads. As
for the king’s menace of slaying me, I am in the grip of his hand;
so let not the king occupy his mind with my slaughter, because I
am like the sparrow in the grasp of the fowler; if he will, he cutteth
his throat, and if he will, he letteth him go. As for the delaying of
my death, ’tis not from the king, but from Him in whose hand is
my life; for, by Allah, O king, an the Almighty willed my slaughter,
thou couldst not postpone it; no, not for a single hour. And,
indeed, man availeth not to fend off evil from himself, even as it
was with the son of King Sulayman Shah, whose anxiety and carefulness
for the winning of his wish in the matter of the new-born
child availed him naught, for his last hour was deferred how many
a time! and Allah saved him until he had accomplished his
period and had fulfilled his life-term.” Cried the king, “Fie upon
thee, how great is thy craft and thy talk! Tell me, what was their
tale.” And the youth said, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF KING SULAYMAN SHAH AND HIS NIECE</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5294" id="noteref-5294" epub:type="noteref">5294</a>”</h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a king named Sulayman Sháh, who was goodly
of policy and rede, and he had a brother who died and left a
daughter; so Sulayman Shah reared her with the best of rearing
and the girl became a model of reason and perfection, nor was
there in her time a more beautiful than she. Now the king had
two sons, one of whom he had appointed in his mind to wed her,
while the other purposed to take her. The elder son’s name was
Bahluwán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5295" id="noteref-5295" epub:type="noteref">5295</a> and that of the younger Malik Sháh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5296" id="noteref-5296" epub:type="noteref">5296</a> and the girl was
called Sháh Khátún. Now one day, King Sulayman Shah went
in to his brother’s daughter and kissing her head, said to her,
“Thou art my daughter and dearer to me than a child, for the love
of thy late father who hath found mercy; wherefore I purpose
espousing thee to one of my sons and appointing him my heir
apparent, so he may be king after me. Look, then, which thou wilt
have of my sons,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5297" id="noteref-5297" epub:type="noteref">5297</a> for that thou hast been reared with them and
knowest them.” The maiden arose and kissing his hand, said to
him, “O my lord, I am thine hand-maid and thou art the ruler over
me; so whatever liketh thee do that same, inasmuch as thy wish is
higher and honourabler and holier than mine and if thou wouldst
have me serve thee as a hand-maid for the rest of my life, ’twere fairer
to me than any mate.” The king commended her speech and conferred
on her a robe of honour and gave her magnificent gifts; after
which, his choice having fallen upon his younger son, Malik Shah,
he wedded her with him and made him his heir apparent and bade
the folk swear fealty to him. When this reached his brother
Bahluwan and he was ware that his younger brother had by favour
been preferred over him, his breast was straitened and the affair
was sore to him and envy entered into him and hate; but he hid
this in his heart, whilst fire raged therein because of the damsel
and the dominion. Meanwhile Shah Khatun went in bridal
splendour to the king’s son and conceived by him and bare a son,
as he were the illuming moon. When Bahluwan saw this betide
his brother, envy and jealousy overcame him; so he went in one
night to his father’s palace and coming to his brother’s chamber,
saw the nurse sleeping at the door, with the cradle before her and
therein his brother’s child asleep. Bahluwan stood by him and
fell to looking upon his face, whose radiance was as that of the
moon, and Satan insinuated himself into his heart, so that he
bethought himself and said, “Why be not this babe mine?
Verily, I am worthier of him than my brother; yea, and of the
damsel and the dominion.” Then the idea got the mastery of him
and anger drave him, so that he took out a knife and setting it to
the child’s gullet, cut his throat and would have severed his windpipe.
So he left him for dead and entering his brother’s chamber,
saw him asleep, with the Princess by his side, and thought to slay
her, but said to himself, “I will leave the girl-wife for myself.”
Then he went up to his brother and cutting his throat, parted
head from body, after which he left him and went away. But
now the world was straitened upon him and his life was a light
matter to him and he sought the lodging of his sire Sulayman
Shah, that he might slay him also, but could not get admission
to him. So he went forth from the palace and hid himself in the
city till the morrow, when he repaired to one of his father’s
fortalices and therein fortified himself. On this wise it was with
him; but as regards the nurse, she presently awoke that she might
give the child suck, and seeing the cradle running with blood,
cried out; whereupon the sleepers started up and the king was
aroused and making for the place, found the child with his throat
cut and the bed running over with blood and his father dead with
a slit weasand in his sleeping chamber. They examined the child
and found life in him and his windpipe whole and they sewed up
the place of the wound: then the king sought his son Bahluwan,
but found him not and saw that he had fled; so he knew that it
was he who had done this deed, and this was grievous to the king
and to the people of his realm and to the lady Shah Khatun.
Thereupon the king laid out his son Malik Shah and buried him
and made him a mighty funeral and they mourned with passing
sore mourning; after which he applied himself to rearing the
infant. As for Bahluwan, when he fled and fortified himself, his
power waxed amain and there remained for him but to make war
upon his father, who had cast his fondness upon the child and
used to rear him on his knees and supplicate Almighty Allah that
he might live, so he might commit the command to him. When
he came to five years of age, the king mounted him on horseback
and the people of the city rejoiced in him and prayed for him
length of life, that he might take vengeance for his father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5298" id="noteref-5298" epub:type="noteref">5298</a> and
heal his grandsire’s heart. Meanwhile, Bahluwan the rebel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5299" id="noteref-5299" epub:type="noteref">5299</a>
addressed himself to pay court to Cæsar, king of the Roum<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5300" id="noteref-5300" epub:type="noteref">5300</a> and
crave aid of him in debelling his father, and he inclined unto him
and gave him a numerous army. His sire the king hearing of
this sent to Cæsar, saying, “O glorious king of might illustrious,
succour not an evil doer. This is my son and he hath done so
and so and cut his brother’s throat and that of his brother’s son in
the cradle.” But he told not the king of the Roum that the child
had recovered and was alive. When Cæsar heard the truth of
the matter, it was grievous to him as grievous could be, and he
sent back to Sulayman Shah, saying, “An it be thy wish, O king,
I will cut off his head and send it to thee.” But he made answer,
saying, “I care naught for him: soon and surely the reward of
his deed and his crimes shall overtake him, if not to-day, then
to-morrow.” And from that date he continued to exchange letters
and presents with Cæsar. Now the king of the Roum heard tell
of the widowed Princess<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5301" id="noteref-5301" epub:type="noteref">5301</a> and of the beauty and loveliness wherewith
she was endowed, wherefore his heart clave to her and he
sent to seek her in wedlock of Sulayman Shah, who could not
refuse him. So he arose and going in to Shah Khatun, said to
her, “O my daughter, the king of the Roum hath sent to me to
seek thee in marriage. What sayst thou?” She wept and replied,
“O king, how canst thou find it in thy heart to address me thus?
As for me, abideth there husband for me, after the son of my
uncle?” Rejoined the king, “O my daughter, ’tis indeed as thou
sayest; but here let us look to the issues of affairs. I must now
take compt of death, for that I am a man shot in years and fear not
save for thee and for thy little son; and indeed I have written to
the king of the Roum and others of the kings and said, His uncle
slew him, and said not that he hath recovered and is living, but
concealed his affair. Now the king of the Roum hath sent to
demand thee in marriage, and this is no thing to be refused and
fain would we have our back strengthened with him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5302" id="noteref-5302" epub:type="noteref">5302</a> And she
was silent and spake not. So King Sulayman Shah made answer to
Cæsar with “Hearing and obeying.” Then he arose and despatched
her to him, and Cæsar went in to her and found her passing the
description wherewith they had described her; wherefore he loved
her every day more and more and preferred her over all his women
and his affection for Sulayman Shah was increased; but Shah
Khatun’s heart still clave to her child and she could say naught.
As for Sulayman Shah’s son, the rebel Bahluwan, when he saw
that Shah Khatun had married the king of the Roum, this
was grievous to him and he despaired of her. Meanwhile, his
father Sulayman Shah watched over the child and cherished him
and named him Malik Shah, after the name of his sire. When he
reached the age of ten, he made the folk do homage to him and
appointed him his heir apparent, and after some days, the old
king’s time for paying the debt of nature drew near and he died.
Now a party of the troops had banded themselves together for
Bahluwan; so they sent to him, and bringing him privily, went
in to the little Malik Shah and seized him and seated his uncle
Bahluwan on the throne of kingship. Then they proclaimed him
king and did homage to him all, saying, “Verily, we desire thee
and deliver to thee the throne of kingship; but we wish of thee that
thou slay not thy brother’s son, because we are still bounden by the
oaths we sware to his sire and his grandsire and the covenants
we made with them.” So Bahluwan granted this to them and
imprisoned the boy in an underground dungeon and straitened
him. Presently, the grievous news reached his mother and this
was to her a fresh grief; but she could not speak and committed
her affair to Allah Almighty, for that she durst not name this
to King Cæsar her spouse, lest she should make her uncle King
Sulayman Shah a liar. But as regards Bahluwan the Rebel, he
abode king in his father’s place and his affairs prospered, while
young Malik Shah lay in the souterrain four full-told years, till
his favour faded and his charms changed. When He (extolled
and exalted be He!) willed to relieve him and to bring him forth
of the prison, Bahluwan sat one day with his chief Officers and the
Lords of his land and discoursed with them of the story of his
sire, King Sulayman Shah and what was in his heart. Now there
were present certain Wazirs, men of worth, and they said to him,
“O king, verily Allah hath been bountiful to thee and hath
brought thee to thy wish, so that thou art become king in thy
father’s place and hast won whatso thou wishedst. But, as for this
youth, there is no guilt in him, because he, from the day of his
coming into the world, hath seen neither ease nor pleasure, and
indeed his favour is faded and his charms changed. What is his
crime that he should merit such pains and penalties? Indeed,
others than he were to blame, and hereto Allah hath given thee
the victory over them, and there is no fault in this poor lad.”
Quoth Bahluwan, “Verily, ’tis as ye say; but I fear his
machinations and am not safe from his mischief; haply the most
part of the folk will incline unto him.” They replied, “O
king, what is this boy and what power hath he? An thou fear
him, send him to one of the frontiers.” And Bahluwan said, “Ye
speak sooth; so we will send him as captain of war to reduce one
of the outlying stations.” Now over against the place in question
was a host of enemies, hard of heart, and in this he designed
the slaughter of the youth: so he bade bring him forth of the
underground dungeon and caused him draw near to him and
saw his case. Then he robed him, whereat the folk rejoiced, and
bound for him the banners<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5303" id="noteref-5303" epub:type="noteref">5303</a> and, giving him a mighty many, despatched
him to the quarter aforesaid, whither all who went or were
slain or were taken. Accordingly Malik Shah fared thither with his
force and when it was one of the days, behold, the enemy attacked
them in the night; whereupon some of his men fled and the rest
the enemy captured; and they seized Malik Shah also and cast
him into a pit with a company of his men. His fellows mourned
over his beauty and loveliness and there he abode a whole twelvemonth
in evillest plight. Now at the beginning of every year it was
the enemy’s wont to bring forth their prisoners and cast them down
from the top of the citadel to the bottom; so at the customed
time they brought them forth and cast them down, and Malik
Shah with them. However, he fell upon the other men and the
ground touched him not, for his term was God-guarded. But
those who were cast down there were slain upon the spot and
their bodies ceased not to lie there till the wild beasts ate them
and the winds scattered their bones. Malik Shah abode strown
in his place and aswoon, all that day and that night, and when he
revived and found himself safe and sound, he thanked Allah the
Most High for his safety and rising, left the place. He gave not
over walking, unknowing whither he went and dieting upon
the leaves of the trees; and by day he hid himself where he
might and fared on at hazard all his night; and thus he did
for some days, till he came to a populous part and seeing folk
there, accosted them. He acquainted them with his case, giving
them to know that he had been prisoned in the fortress and that
they had thrown him down, but Almighty Allah had saved him
and brought him off alive. The people had ruth on him and
gave him to eat and drink and he abode with them several days;
then he questioned them of the way that led to the kingdom of his
uncle Bahluwan, but told them not that he was his father’s brother.
So they showed him the road and he ceased not to go barefoot, till
he drew near his uncle’s capital, naked, anhungered, and indeed
his limbs were lean and his colour changed. He sat down at
the city gate, when behold, up came a company of King Bahluwan’s
chief officers, who were out a-hunting and wished to
water their horses. They lighted down to rest and the youth
accosted them, saying, “I would ask you of somewhat that ye
may acquaint me therewith.” Quoth they, “Ask what thou
wilt;” and quoth he, “Is King Bahluwan well?” They derided
him and replied, “What a fool art thou, O youth! Thou art
a stranger and a beggar, and whence art thou that thou should’st
question concerning the king?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5304" id="noteref-5304" epub:type="noteref">5304</a> Cried he, “In very sooth, he is my
uncle;” whereat they marvelled and said, “’Twas one catch-question<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5305" id="noteref-5305" epub:type="noteref">5305</a>
and now ’tis become two.” Then said they to him,
“O youth, it is as if thou wert Jinn-mad. Whence comest thou
to claim kinship with the king? Indeed, we know not that he
hath any kith and kin save a nephew, a brother’s son, who was
prisoned with him, and he despatched him to wage war upon
the infidels, so that they slew him.” Said Malik Shah, “I am
he and they slew me not, but there befel me this and that.”
They knew him forthwith and rising to him, kissed his hands
and rejoiced in him and said to him, “O our lord, thou art
indeed a king and the son of a king, and we desire thee naught
but good and we pray for thy continuance. Look how Allah
hath rescued thee from this wicked uncle, who sent thee to
a place whence none ever came off safe and sound, purposing
not in this but thy destruction; and indeed thou fellest
upon death from which Allah delivered thee. How, then,
wilt thou return and cast thyself again into thine foeman’s
hand? By Allah, save thyself and return not to him this
second time. Haply thou shalt abide upon the face of the
earth till it please Almighty Allah to receive thee; but, an
thou fall again into his hand, he will not suffer thee to live a
single hour.” The Prince thanked them and said to them, “Allah
reward you with all weal, for indeed ye give me loyal counsel;
but whither would ye have me wend?” Quoth they, “To the
land of the Roum, the abiding-place of thy mother.” “But,”
quoth he, “My grandfather Sulayman Shah, when the king of
the Roum wrote to him demanding my mother in marriage,
hid my affair and secreted my secret; and she hath done the
same, and I cannot make her a liar.” Rejoined they, “Thou
sayst sooth, but we desire thine advantage, and even wert thou to
take service with the folk, ’twere a means of thy continuance.”
Then each and every of them brought out to him money and
gave him a modicum and clad him and fed him and fared on with
him the length of a parasang, till they brought him far from
the city, and letting him know that he was safe, departed from
him, whilst he journeyed till he came forth of his uncle’s reign
and entered the dominion of the Roum. Then he made a
village and taking up his abode therein, applied himself to
serving one there in caring and seeding and the like. As for
his mother, Shah Khatun, great was her longing for her child
and she thought of him ever and news of him was cut off from
her, so her life was troubled and she foresware sleep and could
not make mention of him before King Cæsar her spouse. Now
she had a Castrato who had come with her from the court of
her uncle King Sulayman Shah, and he was intelligent, quick-witted,
right-reded. So she took him apart one day and said
to him, shedding tears the while, “Thou hast been my Eunuch
from my childhood to this day; canst thou not therefore get
me tidings of my son, seeing that I cannot speak of his
matter?” He replied, “O my lady, this is an affair which thou
hast concealed from the commencement, and were thy son
here, ’twould not be possible for thee to entertain him, lest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5306" id="noteref-5306" epub:type="noteref">5306</a>
thine honour be smirched with the king; for they would never
credit thee, since the news hath been bruited abroad that
thy son was slain by his uncle.” Quoth she, “The case is
even as thou sayst and thou speakest sooth; but, provided I
know that my son is alive, let him be in these parts pasturing
sheep and let me not sight him nor he sight me.” He asked,
“How shall we manage in this matter?” and she answered,
“Here be my treasures and my wealth: take all thou wilt
and bring me my son or else tidings of him.” Then they
devised a device between them, which was that they should
feign some business in their own country, to wit that she had
wealth there buried from the time of her husband, Malik Shah,
and that none knew of it but this Eunuch who was with her, so
it behoved him to go fetch it. Accordingly she acquainted the
king her husband with that and sought his permit for the Eunuch
to fare: and the king granted him leave of absence for the
journey and charged him devise a device, lest he come to grief.
The Castrato, therefore, disguised himself in merchant’s habit and
repairing to Bahluwan’s city, began to make espial concerning
the youth’s case; whereupon they told him that he had been
prisoned in a souterrain and that his uncle had released him and
despatched him to such a place, where they had slain him. When
the Eunuch heard this, the mishap was grievous to him and his
breast was straitened and he knew not what to do. It chanced
one day of the days that a certain of the horsemen, who had fallen
in with the young Malik Shah by the water and clad him and
given him spending-money, saw the Eunuch in the city, habited
as a merchant, and recognising him, questioned him of his case
and of the cause of his coming. Quoth he, “I came to sell merchandise;”
and quoth the horseman, “I will tell thee somewhat,
an thou canst keep it secret.” Answered the Neutral, “That I
can! What is it?” and the other said, “We met the king’s son
Malik Shah, I and sundry of the Arabs who were with me, and
saw him by such a water and gave him spending-money and sent
him towards the land of the Roum, near his mother, for that we
feared for him lest his uncle Bahluwan slay him.” Then he told
him all that had passed between them, whereat the Eunuch’s
countenance changed and he said to the cavalier “Thou art safe!”
The knight replied, “Thou also art safe though thou come in
quest of him.” And the Eunuch rejoined, saying, “Truly, that
is my errand: there is no rest for his mother, lying down or
rising up, and she hath sent me to seek news of him.”
Quoth the cavalier, “Go in safety, for he is in a quarter
of the land of the Roum, even as I said to thee.” The
Castrato thanked him and blessed him and mounting, returned
upon his road, following the trail, whilst the knight rode with him
to a certain highway, when he said to him, “This is where we left
him.” Then he took leave of him and returned to his own city,
whilst the Eunuch fared on along the road, enquiring in every
village he entered of the youth, by the description which the rider
had given him, and he ceased not thus to do till he came to the
village wherein was young Malik Shah. So he entered, and dismounting,
made enquiry after the Prince, but none gave him news
of him; whereat he abode perplexed concerning his affair and
made ready to depart. Accordingly he mounted his horse; but, as
he passed through the village, he saw a cow bound with a rope
and a youth asleep by her side, hending the halter in hand; so he
looked at him and passed on and heeded him not in his heart;
but presently he halted and said to himself, “An the youth whom
I am questing have become the like of this sleeping youth whom I
passed but now, how shall I know him? Alas, the length of my
travail and travel! How shall I go about in search of a somebody
I know not, one whom, if I saw him face to face I should not
know?” So saying he turned back, musing anent that sleeping
youth, and coming to him, he still sleeping, dismounted from his
mare and sat down by his side. He fixed his eyes upon his face
and considered him awhile and said in himself, “For aught I wot,
this youth may be Malik Shah;” then he began hemming and
saying, “Harkye, O youth!” Whereupon the sleeper awoke and
sat up; and the Eunuch asked him, “Who be thy father in this
village and where be thy dwelling?” The youth sighed and
replied, “I am a stranger;” and quoth the Castrato, “From what
land art thou and who is thy sire?” Quoth the other, “I am
from such a land,” and the Eunuch ceased not to question him
and he to answer his queries, till he was certified of him and knew
him. So he rose and embraced him and kissed him and wept over
his case: he also told him that he was wandering about in search
of him and informed him that he was come privily from the king,
his mother’s husband, and that his mother would be satisfied to
weet that he was alive and well, though she saw him not. Then he
re-entered the village and buying the Prince a horse, mounted
him and they ceased not going till they came to the frontier of
their own country, where there fell robbers upon them by the way
and took all that was with them and pinioned them; after which
they threw them into a pit hard by the road and went their ways
and left them to die there; and indeed they had cast many folk
into that pit and they had perished. The Eunuch fell a weeping
in the pit and the youth said to him, “What is this weeping and
what shall it profit here?” Quoth the Castrato, “I weep not for
fear of death, but of ruth for thee and the cursedness of thy case
and because of thy mother’s heart and for that which thou hast
suffered of horrors and that thy death should be this ignoble
death, after the endurance of all manner dire distresses.” But
the youth said, “That which hath betided me was writ to me and
that which is written none hath power to efface; and if my life-term
be advanced, none may defer it.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5307" id="noteref-5307" epub:type="noteref">5307</a> Then the twain passed
that night and the following day and the next night and the next
day in the hollow, till they were weak with hunger and came
nigh upon death and could but groan feebly. Now it fortuned
by the decree of Almighty Allah and His destiny, that Cæsar,
king of the Greeks, the spouse of Malik Shah’s mother Shah
Khatun, went forth a-hunting that morning. He flushed a head of
game, he and his company, and chased it, till they came up with
it by that pit, whereupon one of them lighted down from his horse,
to slaughter it, hard by the mouth of the hollow. He heard a sound
of low moaning from the sole of the pit; whereat he arose and
mounting his horse, waited till the troops were assembled. Then
he acquainted the king with this and he bade one of his servants
descend into the hollow: so the man climbed down and brought
out the youth and the Eunuch in fainting condition. They cut
their pinion-bonds and poured wine down their throats, till they
came to themselves, when the king looked at the Eunuch and
recognizing him, said, “Harkye, Such-an-one!” The Castrato
replied, “Yes, O my lord the king,” and prostrated himself to
him; whereat the king wondered with exceeding wonder and
asked him, “How camest thou to this place and what hath befallen
thee?” The Eunuch answered, “I went and took out the treasure
and brought it thus far; but the evil eye was behind me and I
unknowing. So the thieves took us alone here and seized the
money and cast us into this pit that we might die the slow death
of hunger, even as they had done with others; but Allah the
Most High sent thee, in pity to us.” The king marvelled, he and
his, and praised the Lord for that he had come thither; after which
he turned to the Castrato and said to him, “What is this youth
thou hast with thee?” He replied, “O king, this is the son of a
nurse who belonged to us and we left him when he was a little one.
I saw him to-day and his mother said to me, ‘Take him with
thee:’ so this morning I brought him that he might be a servant
to the king, for that he is an adroit youth and a clever.” Then the
king fared on, he and his company, and with them the Eunuch
and the youth, who questioned his companion of Bahluwan and his
dealing with his subjects, and he replied, saying, “As thy head
liveth, O my lord the king, the folk are in sore annoy with him and
not one of them wisheth a sight of him, be they high or low.”
When the king returned to his palace, he went in to his wife Shah
Khatun and said to her, “I give thee the glad tidings of thine
Eunuch’s return;” and he told her what had betided and of
the youth whom he had brought with him. When she heard
this, her wits fled and she would have screamed, but her reason
restrained her, and the king said to her, “What is this? Art thou
overcome with grief for the loss of the monies or for that which
hath befallen the Eunuch?” Said she, “Nay, as thy head liveth,
O king! but women are weaklings.” Then came the Castrato
and going in to her, told her all that had happened to him and
also acquainted her with her son’s case and with that which he
had suffered of distresses and how his uncle had exposed him
to slaughter, and he had been taken prisoner and they had cast
him into the pit and hurled him from the highmost of the
citadel and how Allah had delivered him from these perils, all of
them; and whilst he recounted to her all this, she wept. Then
she asked him, “When the king saw him and questioned thee of
him, what was it thou saidst him?” and he answered, “I said to
him:—This is the son of a nurse who belonged to us. We
left him a little one and he grew up; so I brought him,
that he might be servant to the king.” Cried she, “Thou didst
well;” and she charged him to serve the Prince with faithful service.
As for the king, he redoubled in kindness to the Castrato and
appointed the youth a liberal allowance and he abode going in to
and coming out of the king’s house and standing in his service, and
every day he waxed better with him. As for Shah Khatun, she used
to station herself at watch for him at the windows and in the
balconies and gaze upon him, and she frying on coals of fire on his
account; yet could she not speak. In such condition she abode a
long while and indeed yearning for him was killing her; so she
stood and watched for him one day at the door of her chamber and
straining him to her bosom, bussed him on the breast and kissed
him on either cheek. At this moment, behold, out came the
major-domo of the king’s household and seeing her embracing
the youth, started in amazement. Then he asked to whom that
chamber belonged and was answered, “To Shah Khatun, wife of
the king,” whereupon he turned back, quaking as one smitten by
a leven-bolt. The king saw him in a tremor and said to him,
“Out on thee! what is the matter?” Said he, “O King, what
matter can be more grievous than that which I see?” Asked the
king, “What seest thou?” and the officer answered, “I see that
the youth, who came with the Eunuch, was not brought with him
save on account of Shah Khatun; for I passed but now by her
chamber door, and she was standing, watching; and when the
youth came up, she rose to him and clipped him and kissed him
on his cheek.” When the king heard this, he bowed his head
amazed, perplexed, and sinking into a seat, clutched at his beard
and shook it till he came nigh upon plucking it out. Then he
arose forthright and laid hands on the youth and clapped him in
jail he also took the Eunuch and cast them both into a
souterrain under his palace. After this he went in to Shah
Khatun and said to her, “Brava, by Allah, O daughter of nobles.
O thou whom kings sought to wed, for the purity of thy repute
and the fairness of the fame of thee! How seemly is thy
semblance! Now may Allah curse her whose inward contrarieth
her outward, after the likeness of thy base favour, whose exterior
is handsome and its interior fulsome, face fair and deeds foul!
Verily, I mean to make of thee and of yonder ne’er-do-well an
example among the lieges, for that thou sentest not thine Eunuch
but of intent on his account, so that he took him and brought him
into my palace and thou hast trampled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5308" id="noteref-5308" epub:type="noteref">5308</a> my head with him; and
this is none other than exceeding boldness; but thou shalt see
what I will do with you all.” So saying, he spat in her face and
went out from her; whilst Shah Khatun said nothing, well knowing
that, an she spoke at that time, he would not credit her speech:
Then she humbled herself in supplication to Allah Almighty and
said, “O God the Great, Thou knowest the things by secrecy
ensealed and their outwards revealed and their inwards concealed!
If an advanced life-term be appointed to me, let it not be deferred,
and if a deferred one, let it not be advanced!” On this wise she
passed some days, whilst the king fell into bewilderment and
forsware meat and drink and sleep, and abode, knowing not what
he should do and saying to himself, “An I slay the Eunuch and
the youth, my soul will not be solaced, for they are not to blame,
seeing that she sent to fetch him, and my heart careth not to kill
them all three. But I will not be hasty in doing them die,
for that I fear repentance.” Then he left them, so he might look
into the affair. Now he had a nurse, a foster-mother, on whose
knees he had been reared, and she was a woman of understanding
and suspected him, yet dared not question him. So she went in
to Shah Khatun and finding her in yet sadder plight than he,
asked her what was to do; but she refused to answer. However,
the nurse gave not over coaxing and questioning her, till she swore
her to concealment. Accordingly, the old woman made oath that
she would keep secret all that she should say to her, whereupon
the Queen to her related her history, first and last, and told her
that the youth was her son. With this the old woman prostrated
herself before her and said to her, “This is a right easy matter.”
But the Queen replied, “By Allah, O my mother, I prefer my
destruction and that of my son to defending myself by a plea
which they will not believe; for they will say:—She pleadeth this
only that she may fend off shame from herself. And naught will
profit me save long-suffering.” The old woman was moved by her
speech and her wisdom and said to her, “Indeed, O my daughter,
’tis as thou sayest, and I hope in Allah that He will show forth
the truth. Have patience and I will presently go in to the king
and hear his words and machinate somewhat in this matter,
Inshallah!” Thereupon the ancient dame arose and going into the
king, found him with his head between his knees in sore pain of
sorrow. She sat down by him awhile and bespake him with soft
words and said to him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5309" id="noteref-5309" epub:type="noteref">5309</a> “Indeed, O my son, thou consumest my
vitals, for that these many days thou hast not mounted horse, and
thou grievest and I know not what aileth thee.” He replied, “O
my mother, all is due to yonder accursed, of whom I deemed so
well and who hath done this and that.” Then he related to her the
whole story from beginning to end, and she cried to him, “This
thy chagrin is on account of a no-better-than-she-should-be!”
Quoth he, “I was but considering by what death I should slay
them, so the folk may take warning and repent.” And quoth she,
“O my son, ’ware precipitance, for it gendereth repentance and the
slaying of them shall not escape thee. When thou art assured of
this affair, do whatso thou willest.” He rejoined, “O my mother,
there needeth no assurance anent him for whom she despatched
her Eunuch and he fetched him.” But she retorted, “There is a
thing wherewith we will make her confess,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5310" id="noteref-5310" epub:type="noteref">5310</a> and all that is in
her heart shall be discovered to thee.” Asked the king, “What
is that?” and she answered, “I will bring thee the heart of a
hoopoe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5311" id="noteref-5311" epub:type="noteref">5311</a> which, when she sleepeth, do thou lay upon her bosom and
question her of everything thou wouldest know, and she will discover
the same unto thee and show forth the truth to thee.” The king
rejoiced in this and said to his nurse, “Hasten thou and let none
know of thee.” So she arose and going in to the Queen, said
to her, “I have done thy business and ’tis as follows. This
night the king will come in to thee and do thou seem asleep; and
if he ask thee of aught, do thou answer him, as if in thy sleep.”
The Queen thanked her and the old dame went away and fetching
the bird’s heart, gave it to the king. Hardly was the night come,
when he went in to his wife and found her lying back, a-slumbering;
so he sat down by her side and laying the hoopoe’s heart on her
breast, waited awhile, so he might be assured that she slept. Then
said he to her, “Shah Khatun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5312" id="noteref-5312" epub:type="noteref">5312</a> Shah Khatun, is this my reward
from thee?” Quoth she, “What offence have I committed?” and
quoth he, “What offence can be greater than this? Thou sentest
after yonder youth and broughtest him hither, on account of the
lust of thy heart, so thou mightest do with him that for which thou
lustedst.” Said she, “I know not carnal desire. Verily, among
thy pages are those who are comelier and seemlier than he; yet
have I never desired one of them.” He asked “Why, then, didst
thou lay hold of him and kiss him?” And she answered, “This
youth is my son and a piece of my liver; and of my longing and
affection for him, I could not contain myself, but sprang upon him
and kissed him.” When the king heard this, he was dazed and
amazed and said to her, “Hast thou a proof that this youth is thy
son? Indeed, I have a letter from thine uncle King Sulayman
Shah, informing me that his uncle Bahluwan cut his throat.” Said
she “Yes, he did indeed cut his throat, but severed not the windpipe;
so my uncle sewed up the wound and reared him, for that
his life-term was not come.” When the king heard this, he said,
“This proof sufficeth me,” and rising forthright in the night, bade
bring the youth and the Eunuch. Then he examined his stepson’s
throat with a candle and saw the scar where it had been cut from
ear to ear, and indeed the place had healed up and it was like a
thread stretched out. Thereupon the king fell down prostrate before
Allah, who had delivered the Prince from all these perils and from
the distresses he had suffered, and rejoiced with joy exceeding
because he had delayed and had not made haste to slay him, in
which case mighty sore repentance had betided him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5313" id="noteref-5313" epub:type="noteref">5313</a> “As for the
youth” continued the young treasurer, “he was not saved but
because his life-term was deferred, and in like manner, O king, ’tis
with me: I too have a deferred term, which I shall attain, and a
period which I shall accomplish, and I trust in Almighty Allah
that He will give me the victory over these villain Wazirs.”
When the youth had made an end of his speech, the king said,
“Restore him to the prison;” and when they had done this, he
turned to the Ministers and said to them, “Yonder youth
lengtheneth his tongue upon you, but I know your tenderness for
the weal of mine empire and your loyal counsel to me; so be of
good heart, for all that ye advise me I will do.” They rejoiced
when they heard these words, and each of them said his say.
Then quoth the king, “I have not deferred his slaughter but to
the intent that the talk might be prolonged and that words might
abound, yet shall he now be slain without let or stay, and I desire
that forthright ye set up for him a gibbet without the town and
that the crier cry among the folk bidding them assemble and take
him and carry him in procession to the gibbet, with the crier
crying before him and saying:—This is the reward of him whom
the king delighted to favour and who hath betrayed him!” The
Wazirs rejoiced when they heard this, and for their joy slept not
that night; and they made proclamation in the city and set up
the gallows.</p>

    <div>The Eleventh Day.</div>

<h3 class="c012">OF THE SPEEDY RELIEF OF ALLAH.</h3>

<p class="c013">When it was the eleventh day, the Wazirs repaired in early
morning to the king’s gate and said to him, “O king, the folk are
assembled from the portals of the palace to the gibbet, to the end
they may see the king’s order carried out on the youth.” So
Azadbakht bade fetch the prisoner and they brought him; whereupon
the Ministers turned to him and said to him, “O vile of
birth, can any lust for life remain with thee and canst thou hope
for deliverance after this day?” Said he, “O wicked Wazirs, shall
a man of understanding renounce all esperance in Almighty
Allah? Howsoever a man be oppressed, there cometh to him
deliverance from the midst of distress and life from the midst of
death, as in the case of the prisoner and how Allah delivered him.”
Asked the king, “What is his story?” and the youth answered,
saying, “O king, they tell</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF THE PRISONER AND HOW ALLAH GAVE HIM RELIEF</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5314" id="noteref-5314" epub:type="noteref">5314</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a king of the kings, who had a high palace,
overlooking his prison, and he used to hear in the night one saying,
“O Ever-present Deliverer, O Thou whose deliverance is aye
present, relieve Thou me!” One day the king waxed wroth and
said, “Yonder fool looketh for relief from the pains and penalties
of his crime.” Then said he to his officers, “Who is in yonder
jail?” and said they, “Folk upon whom blood hath been
found.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5315" id="noteref-5315" epub:type="noteref">5315</a> Hearing this the king bade bring that man before him
and said to him, “O fool, O little of wit, how shalt thou be delivered
from this prison, seeing that thy crime is mortal?” Then he
committed him to a company of his guards and said to them,
“Take this wight and crucify him within sight of the city.” Now
it was the night season. So the soldiers carried him without the
city, thinking to crucify him, when behold, there came out upon
them robbers and fell upon them with swords and other weapons.
Thereat the guards left him whom they purposed to slay and fled
whilst the man who was going to slaughter also took to flight and
plunging deep into the desert, knew not whither he went before he
found himself in a copse and there came out upon him a lion of
terrible aspect, who snatched him up and cast him under him.
Then he went up to a tree and uprooting it, covered the man
therewithal and made off into the thicket, in quest of the lioness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5316" id="noteref-5316" epub:type="noteref">5316</a>
As for the man, he committed his affair to Allah the Most High,
relying upon Him for deliverance, and said to himself, “What is
this affair?” Then he removed the leaves from himself and
rising, saw great plenty of men’s bones there, of those whom the
lion had devoured. He looked again and behold, he saw a heap
of gold lying alongside a purse-belt;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5317" id="noteref-5317" epub:type="noteref">5317</a> whereat he marvelled and
gathering up the gold in the breast of his gaberdine, went forth of
the copse and fled at hap-hazard, turning neither to the right nor
to the left, in his fear of the lion; nor did he cease flying till he
came to a village and cast himself down, as he were dead. He
lay there till the day appeared and he was rested from his travail,
when he arose and burying the gold, entered the village. Thus
Allah gave him relief and he got the gold. Then said the king,
“How long wilt thou beguile us, O youth, with thy prate? But
now the hour of thy slaughter is come.” So he bade crucify him
upon the gibbet. But as they were about to hoist him up, lo and
behold! the Captain of the thieves, who had found him and reared
him, came up at that moment and asked, “What be this assembly
and the cause of the crowds here gathered together?” They
informed him that a page of the king had committed a mighty
great crime and that he was about to do him die; so the Captain
of the thieves pressed forward and looking upon the prisoner, knew
him, whereupon he went up to him and strained him to his bosom
and threw his arms round his neck, and fell to kissing him upon
his mouth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5318" id="noteref-5318" epub:type="noteref">5318</a> Then said he, “This is a boy I found under such a
mountain, wrapped in a gown of brocade, and I reared him and he
fell to cutting the way with us. One day, we set upon a caravan,
but they put us to flight and wounded some of us and took the
lad and ganged their gait. From that day to this I have gone
round about the lands seeking him, but have not found news
of him till now; and this is he.” When the king heard this, he
was assured that the youth was his very son; so he cried out at
the top of his voice and casting himself upon him, embraced him
and kissed him and shedding tears, said, “Had I put thee to death,
as was mine intent, I should have died of regret for thee.” Then
he cut his pinion-bonds and taking his crown from his head, set it
on the head of his son, whereupon the people raised cries of joy,
whilst the trumpets blared and the kettle-drums beat and there
befel a mighty great rejoicing. They decorated the city and it
was a glorious day; even the birds stayed their flight in the welkin,
for the greatness of the greeting and the clamour of the crying.
The army and the folk carried the prince to the palace in splendid
procession, and the news came to his mother Bahrjaur, who fared
forth and threw herself upon him. Moreover, the king bade open
the prison and bring forth all who were therein, and they held high
festival seven days and seven nights and rejoiced with a mighty
rejoicing. Thus it betided the youth; but as regards the Ministers,
terror and silence, shame and affright fell upon them and they gave
themselves up for lost. After this the king sat, with his son by
his side and the Wazirs on their knees before him, and summoned
his chief officers and the subjects of the city. Then the prince
turned to the Ministers and said to them, “See, O villain Wazirs,
the work of Allah and his speedy relief.” But they answered ne’er
a syllable and the king said, “It sufficeth me that there is nothing
alive but rejoiceth with me this day, even to the birds in the sky,
but ye, your breasts are straitened. Indeed, this is the greatest
of hostility in you me-wards, and had I hearkened to you, my
regret had been prolonged and I had died miserably of sorrow.”
Quoth the prince, “O my father, but for the fairness of thy thought
and thy perspicacity and thy longanimity and deliberation in
affairs, there had not betided thee this great joy. Hadst thou
slain me in haste, repentance would have been sore on thee and
longsome annoy, and on this wise whoso preferreth haste shall
rue.” Presently the king sent for the Captain of the robbers
and bade indue him with a robe of honour, commanding that all
who loved the king should doff their dresses and cast them upon
him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5319" id="noteref-5319" epub:type="noteref">5319</a> So there fell robes of honour on him, till he was a-wearied
with their weight, and Azadbakht invested him with the mastership
of the police of his city. Then he bade set up other nine gibbets
by the side of the first and said to his son, “Thou art innocent,
and yet these villain Wazirs strave for thy slaughter.” Replied
the prince, “O my sire, I had no fault in their eyes but that I
was a loyal counsellor to thee and still kept watch over thy wealth
and withdrew their hands from thy hoards and treasuries; wherefore
they were jealous and envied me and plotted against me and
planned to slay me.” Quoth the king, “The time of retribution
is at hand, O my son; but what be thy rede we should do with
them in requital of that they did with thee? And indeed they
have striven for thy slaughter and exposed thee to disgrace and
smirched mine honour among the kings.” Then he turned to
the Wazirs and said to them, “Woe to you! What liars ye
are! And is aught of excuse left to you?” Said they, “O
king, there remaineth no excuse for us and we are houghed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5320" id="noteref-5320" epub:type="noteref">5320</a> by
the deed we would have done to him. Indeed we planned evil
to this youth and it hath reverted upon us, and we plotted
mischief against him and it hath overtaken us; yea, we digged
for him a pit and we ourselves have fallen into it.” So the king
bade hoist up the Wazirs upon the gibbets and crucify them there,
because Allah is just and decreeth that which is due. Then
Azadbakht and his wife and son abode in joyance and gladness,
till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and they died all;
and extolled be the Living One, who dieth not, to whom be glory
and whose mercy be upon us for ever and ever! Amen.</p>
