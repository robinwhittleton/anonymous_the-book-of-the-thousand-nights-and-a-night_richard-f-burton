<p>One day of the days, as I stood at the door of my house, and the
heat was excessive, behold, I saw a fair woman approaching, and
with her a slave-girl carrying a parcel. They gave not over going till
they came up to me, when the woman stopped and asked me, “Hast
thou a draught of water?” Answered I, “Yes, enter the vestibule,
O my lady, so thou mayst drink.” Accordingly she came in and
I went up into the house and fetched two gugglets of earthenware,
smoked with musk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6091" id="noteref-6091" epub:type="noteref">6091</a> and full of cold water. She took one of them
and discovered her face, the better to drink; whereupon I saw that
she was as the rising moon or the resplendent sun and said to her,
“O my lady, wilt thou not come up into the house, so thou mayst rest
thyself till the air cool and afterwards fare thee to thine own place?”
Quoth she, “Is there none with thee?” and quoth I, “Indeed I am
a bachelor and have none belonging to me, nor is there a wight in
the site;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6092" id="noteref-6092" epub:type="noteref">6092</a> whereupon she said, “An thou be a stranger, thou art he
in quest of whom I was going about.” So she went up into the
house and doffed her walking dress and I found her as she were
the full moon. I brought her what I had by me of food and drink
and said to her, “O my lady, excuse me: this is all that is ready;”
and said she, “This is right good<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6093" id="noteref-6093" epub:type="noteref">6093</a> and indeed ’tis what I sought.”
Then she ate and gave the slave-girl that which was left; after
which I brought her a casting-bottle of musked rose-water, and
she washed her hands and abode with me till the season of mid-afternoon
prayer, when she brought out of the parcel she had with
her a shirt and trousers and an upper garment<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6094" id="noteref-6094" epub:type="noteref">6094</a> and a gold-worked
kerchief and gave them to me; saying, “Know that I am one of
the concubines of the Caliph, and we be forty concubines, each of
whom hath a cicisbeo who cometh to her as often as she would
have him; and none is without a lover save myself, wherefore I
came forth this day to get me a gallant and now I have found thee.
Thou must know that the Caliph lieth each night with one of us,
whilst the other nine-and-thirty concubines take their ease with
the nine-and-thirty masculines, and I would have thee company
with me on such a day, when do thou come up to the palace of
the Caliph and sit awaiting me in such a place, till a little eunuch
come out to thee and say to thee a certain watch-word which is, Art
thou Sandal? Answer Yes, and wend thee with him.” Then she
took leave of me and I of her, after I had strained her to my bosom
and thrown my arms round her neck and we had exchanged kisses
awhile. So she fared forth and I abode patiently expecting the
appointed day, till it came, when I arose and went out, intending
for the trysting-place; but a friend of mine met me by the way
and made me go home with him. I accompanied him and when I
came up into his sitting-chamber he locked the door on me and
walked out to fetch what we might eat and drink. He was absent
until midday, then till the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, whereat I
was chagrined with sore concern. Then he was missing till sundown,
and I was like to die of vexation and impatience; and
indeed he returned not and I passed my night on wake, nigh upon
death, for the door was locked on me, and my soul was like to
depart my body on account of the assignation. At daybreak, my
friend returned and opening the door, came in, bringing with him
meat-pudding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6095" id="noteref-6095" epub:type="noteref">6095</a> and fritters and bees’ honey, and said to me, “By
Allah, thou must needs excuse me, for that I was with a company
and they locked the door on me and have let me go but this very
moment.” I returned him no reply; however, he set before me
that which was with him and I ate a single mouthful and went out
running at speed so haply I might overtake the rendezvous which
had escaped me. When I came to the palace, I saw over against
it eight-and-thirty gibbets set up, whereon were eight-and-thirty
men crucified, and under them eight-and-thirty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6096" id="noteref-6096" epub:type="noteref">6096</a> concubines as
they were moons. So I asked the cause of the crucifixion of the
men and concerning the women in question, and it was said unto
me, “The men thou seest crucified the Caliph found with yonder
damsels, who be his bed-fellows.” When I heard this, I prostrated
myself in thanksgiving to Allah and said, “The Almighty requite
thee with all good, O my friend!” For had he not invited
me and locked me up in his house that night, I had been crucified
with these men, wherefore Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord!
“On this wise,” (continued Shahrazad), “none is safe from the
calamities of the world and the vicissitudes of Time, and in proof
of this, I will relate unto thee yet another story still rarer and
stranger than this. Know, O king, that one said to me: A friend
of mine, a merchant, told me the following tale of</p>
