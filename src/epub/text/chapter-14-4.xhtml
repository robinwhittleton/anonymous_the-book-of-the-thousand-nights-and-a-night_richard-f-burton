    <div>The Three Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other then sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that there was a certain
eater of Bhang whose wont it was every day to buy three
Faddahs’ worth of hemp and he would eat one third thereof in the
morning and a second at noon and the rest about sundown. He
was by calling a fisherman; and regularly as dawn appeared he
would take hook and line and go down to the river a-fishing; then
he would sell of his catch a portion, expending half a Faddah on
bread and eat this with the remaining part of the fish broiled. He
would also provide himself day by day with a waxen taper and
light it in his cell and sit before it, taking his pleasure and talking
to himself after his large dose of Bhang. In such condition he
abode a while of time until one fine spring-night, about the middle
of the month when the moon was shining sheeniest, he sat down
to bespeak himself and said, “Ho, Such-an-one! hie thee forth and
solace thy soul with looking at the world, for this be a time when
none will espy thee and the winds are still.” Herewith he went
forth intending for the river; but as soon as he issued from his celldoor
and trod upon the square, he beheld the moonbeams bestrown
upon the surface and, for the excess of his Bhang, his Fancy
said to him, “By Allah, soothly the stream floweth strong and
therein needs must be much store of fish. Return, O Such-an-one,
to thy cell, bring hook and line and cast them into these
waters; haply Allah our Lord shall vouchsafe thee somewhat of
fish, for men say that by night the fisher-wight on mighty fine work
shall alight.” He presently brought out his gear and, having
baited the hook, made a cast into the moonlit square, taking station
in the shadow of the walls where he believed the river bank
to be. Then he bobbed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6899" id="noteref-6899" epub:type="noteref">6899</a> with his hook and line and kept gazing
at the waters, when behold! a big dog sniffed the bait and coming
up to it swallowed the hook till it stuck in his gullet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6900" id="noteref-6900" epub:type="noteref">6900</a> The beast
feeling it prick his throttle yelped with pain and made more noise
every minute, rushing about to the right and the left: so the line
was shaken in the man’s hand and he drew it in, but by so doing
the hook pierced deeper and the brute howled all the louder; and
it was pull Bhang-eater and pull cur. But the man dared not
draw near the moonlight, holding it to be the river, so he tucked up
his gown to his hip-bones, and as the dog pulled more lustily he
said in his mind, “By Allah this must be a mighty big fish and I
believe it to be a ravenous.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6901" id="noteref-6901" epub:type="noteref">6901</a> Then he gripped the line firmly and
haled it in but the dog had the better of him and dragged him to
the very marge of the moonlight; so the fisherman waxed afraid and
began to cry “Alack! Alack! Alack!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6902" id="noteref-6902" epub:type="noteref">6902</a> To my rescue ye braves!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6903" id="noteref-6903" epub:type="noteref">6903</a>
Help me for a monster of the deep would drown me! Yállah,
hurry ye, my fine fellows, hasten to my aid!” Now at that hour
people were enjoying the sweets of sleep and when they heard
these unseasonable outcries they flocked about him from every
side and accosting him asked, “What is it? What maketh
thee cry aloud at such an hour? What hath befallen thee?”
He answered, “Save me, otherwise a river-monster will cause
me fall into the stream and be drowned.” Then, finding him
tucked up to the hips, the folk approached him and enquired,
“Where is the stream of which thou speakest?” and he replied,
“Yonder’s the river; be ye all blind?” Thereat they understood
that he spoke of the moonbeams, whose sheen was dispread upon
earth, deeming it a river-surface, and they told him this; but he
would not credit them and cried, “So ye also desire to drown me:
be off from me! our Lord will send me other than you to lend
me good aid at this hour of need.” They replied, “O well-born
one, this be moonshine;” but he rejoined, “Away from me, ye low
fellows,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6904" id="noteref-6904" epub:type="noteref">6904</a> ye dogs!” They derided him and the angrier he grew
the more they laughed, till at last they said one to other, “Let us
leave him and wend our ways,” and they quitted him in such condition——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
Sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the folk
who flocked to the assistance of the Bhang-eater left him in such
condition, he crying aloud in affright, the dog being now before
him in a phrenzy of pain for the hook sticking in his gullet and
being unable to rid himself of it, while the man dreaded to draw
near the moonshine, still deeming (albeit he stood upon <span xml:lang="la">terra firma</span>)
that he was about to step into the stream. So he hugged the
wall shadow which to him represented the river-bank. In this
case he continued until day brake and light shone and the to-ing
and fro-ing of the folk increased; withal he remained as he was,
crying out for affright lest he be drowned. Suddenly a Kazi rode by
him and seeing him with gown kilted up and the hound hanging on
to the hook, asked, “What may be the matter with thee, O man?”
He answered saying, “O my lord, I dread lest I be drowned in
this stream, whither a monster of the deep is a-dragging me.”
The judge looked at him and knew him for a Bhang-eater, so he
dismounted from his monture and cried to one of his attendants,
“Catch hold of yon dog and unhook him!” Now this Kazi
was also one who was wont to use Hashísh; so quoth he to himself,
“By Allah, take this fellow with thee and feed him in thy
house and make a mocking-stock of him; and, as each night
cometh on do thou and he eat together a portion of the drug and
enjoy each other’s company.” Accordingly he took him and
carrying him to his quarters seated him in a private stead until
nightfall when the twain met and supped together; then they
swallowed a large dose of Bhang and they lit candles and sat in
their light to enjoy themselves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6905" id="noteref-6905" epub:type="noteref">6905</a> Presently from excess of the
drug they became as men Jinn-mad, uttering words which befit not
to intend or to indite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6906" id="noteref-6906" epub:type="noteref">6906</a> amongst which were a saying of the Bhang-eater
to the Kazi, “By Allah, at this season I’m as great as the
King;” and the Judge’s reply, “And I also at such time am as
great as the Basha, the Governor.” Thereupon quoth to him
the Bhang-eater, “I’m high above thee and if the King would cut
off the Governor’s head what would happen to hinder him?” And
quoth the Kazi, “Yea, verily; naught would hinder him; but ’tis
the custom of Kings to appoint unto Governors a place wherein
they may deal commandment.” Then they fell to debating the
affairs of the Government and the Sultanate, when by decree of
the Decreer the Sultan of the city went forth his palace that very
night, accompanied by the Wazir (and the twain in disguise); and
they ceased not traversing the town till they reached the house
wherein sat the Bhang-eater and the Kazi. So they stood at the
door and heard their talk from first to last when the King turned
to the Minister and asked, “What shall we do with these two
fellows?” “Be patient, O King of the Age,” answered the Wazir,
“until they make an end of their talk, after which whatso thou
wilt do with them that will they deserve.” “True indeed,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6907" id="noteref-6907" epub:type="noteref">6907</a> quoth
the ruler, “nevertheless, instead of standing here let us go in to
them.” Now that night the boon-companions had left the door
open forgetting to padlock it; so the visitors entered and salam’d
to them and they returned the greeting and rose to them and
bade them be seated. Accordingly they sat down and the Sultan
said to the Bhang-eater, “O man, fearest thou not aught from the
Sovran, thou and thy friend; and are ye sitting up until this hour?”
He replied, “The Sultan himself often fareth forth at such untimely
time, and as he is a King even so am I, and yonder man is
my Basha: moreover, if the ruler think to make japery of us, we
are his equals and more.” Thereupon the Sultan turned to his
Wazir and said by signals, “I purpose to strike off the heads of
these fellows;” and said the Minister in the same way, “O King,
needs must they have a story, for no man with his wits in his
head would have uttered such utterance. But patience were our
bestest plan.” Then cried the Bhang-eater to the Sultan, “O
man, whenever we say a syllable, thou signallest to thine associate.
What is it thou wouldst notify to him and we not understanding
it? By Allah, unless thou sit respectfully in our presence we will
bid our Basha strike off thy pate!”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when
the Sultan heard the Bhang-eater’s words he waxed the more
furious and would have arisen and struck off his head; but
the Wazir winked at him and whispered, “O King of the Age, I
and thou are in disguise and these men imagine that we are of
the commons: so be thou pitiful even as Almighty Allah is pitiful
and willeth not the punishment of the sinner. Furthermore, I
conceive that the twain are eaters of Hashísh, which drug when
swallowed by man, garreth him prattle of whatso he pleaseth and
chooseth, making him now a Sultan then a Wazir and then a
merchant, the while it seemeth to him that the world is in the
hollow of his hand.” Quoth the Sultan, “And what may be thy
description of Hashísh?” and quoth the Wazir, “’Tis composed
of hemp leaflets, whereto they add aromatic roots and somewhat
of sugar: then they cook it and prepare a kind of confection which
they eat;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6908" id="noteref-6908" epub:type="noteref">6908</a> but whoso eateth it (especially an he eat more than
enough), talketh of matters which reason may on no wise represent.
If thou wouldst know its secret properties, on the coming
night (Inshallah!) we will bring some with us and administer it to
these two men; and when they eat it the dose will be in addition
to their ordinary.” After this the Sultan left them and went
forth, when the Bhang-eater said to the Kazi, “By Allah, this
night we have enjoyed ourselves and next night (if Allah please!)
we will enjoy ourselves yet more.” The other replied, “Yes,
but I fear from the Sultan, lest he learn our practice and cut off
our heads.” “Who shall bring the Sovran to us?” asked the
other: “he is in his palace and we are in our own place; and,
granting he come, I will divert him by recounting an adventure
which befel me.” The Kazi answered, “Have no dread of the
Sultan; for he may not fare forth a-nights single-handed; nay,
what while he issueth forth he must be escorted by his high
officials.” Now when the next night fell, the Kazi brought the
Hashish which he divided into two halves, eating one himself and
giving the other to his companion; and both swallowed their
portions after supper and then lit the waxen tapers and sat down
to take their pleasure.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6909" id="noteref-6909" epub:type="noteref">6909</a> Suddenly the Sultan and his Wazir came
in upon them during the height of their enjoyment, and the
visitors were habited in dress other than before, and they brought
with them a quantity of Bhang-confection and also some conserve
of roses: so they handed a portion of the first to the revellers,
which these accepted and ate, while they themselves swallowed the
conserve, the others supposing it to be Hashish like what they
had eaten. Now when they had taken an overdose, they got into
a hurly-burly of words and fell to saying things which can neither
be intended nor indited, and amongst these they exclaimed, “By
Allah, the Sultan is deposed and we will rule in his stead and
deal commandment to his reign.” The other enquired, “And if
the Sultan summon us what wilt thou say to him?” “By Allah,
I will tell him a tale which befel myself and crave of him ten
Faddahs wherewithal to buy Bhang!” “And hast thou any skill
in tale-telling?” “In good sooth I have!” “But how wilt thou
depose the Sultan and reign in his stead?” “I will say to him
‘Be off!’ and he will go.” “He will strike thy neck.” “Nay, the
Sultan is pitiful and will not punish me for my words.” So saying
the Bhang-eater arose and loosed the inkle of his bag-trowsers,
then approaching the Sultan he drew forth his prickle and proceeded
to bepiss him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6910" id="noteref-6910" epub:type="noteref">6910</a> but the King took flight as the other faced
him, and fled before him, he pursuing.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Bhang-eater holding up his bag-trowsers ran after the Sultan
purposing to bepiss him and caught up the fugitive at the doorway
when he fell over the threshold and began a-piddling upon
his own clothes. In like manner the Kazi attempted to bepiss
the Wazir and ran after him to the entrance, where he also fell
upon the Bhang-eater and took to making water over him. So
the Bhang-eater and the Kazi lay each bewraying other, and the
Sultan and the Wazir stood laughing at them and saying, “By
Allah, too much Hashish injureth man’s wits;” and presently they
left and went their ways returning to their palaces. But the two
drunkards ceased not lying in their own water till day broke; and
when the fumes of the drug had left their brains, they arose and
found themselves dripping and befouled with their own filth.
Thereupon each said to other, “What be this cross hath betided
us?” Presently they arose and washed themselves and their
clothes; then sitting down together they said, “None did this
deed by us save and except the two fellows who were with us;
and who knoweth what they were, or citizens of this city or
strangers; for ’twas they brought the intoxicant which we ate
and it bred a madness in our brains. Verily ’twas they did the
mischief; but, an they come to us a third time, needs must we be
instant with them and learn from them an they be foreigners or
folk of this city: we will force them to confess, but if they hide
them from us we will turn them out.” On the next night they
met again and the two sat down and ate a quantity of Hashish
after they had supped: and they lit the waxen tapers and each of
them drank a cup of coffee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6911" id="noteref-6911" epub:type="noteref">6911</a> Presently their heads whirled round
under the drug and they sat down to talk and enjoy themselves
when their drunkenness said to them, “Up with you and dance.”
Accordingly they arose and danced, when behold, the Sultan and
his Wazir suddenly came in upon them and salam’d to them: so they
returned the salutation but continued the saltation. The new comers
considered them in this condition and forthwith the King turned
to the Minister and said, “What shall we do with them?” Said the
other, “Patience until their case come to end in somewhat whereof
we can lay hold.” Then they chose seats for themselves and solaced
them with the spectacle, and the dancers kept on dancing until they
were tired and were compelled to sit down and take their rest.
Presently the Bhang-eater looked at the Sultan and exclaimed,
“You, whence are you?” and he replied, “We be foreigner folk
and never visited this city before that night when we met you; and
as we heard you making merry we entered to partake of your
merriment.” On this wise the device recoiled upon the Bhang-eater
and presently the King asked them, saying, “Fear ye not
lest the Sultan hear of you, and ye in this condition which would
cause your disgrace at his hands?” The Bhang-eater answered,
“The Sultan! What tidings of us can he have? He is in the
royal Palace and we in our place of Bhang-eating.” The Sovran
rejoined, “Why not go to him! Belike he will gift you and
largesse you;” but the Bhang-eater retorted, “We fear his people
lest they drive us away.” Whereto quoth the King, “They will
not do on such wise and if thou require it we will write thee a note
to his address, for we know him of old inasmuch as both of us
learned to read in the same school.” “Write thy writ,” quoth the
other to the Sultan who after inditing it and sealing it placed it in
their hands and presently the two visitors departed. Then the
Bhang-eater and the Kazi sat together through the night until
daylight did appear when the fumes of the Hashish had fled their
brains and the weather waxed fine and clear. So they said, each
to other, “Let us go to the Sultan,” and the twain set out together
and walked till they reached the square facing the Palace. Here,
finding a crowd of folk, they went up to the door and the Bhang-eater
drew forth his letter and handed it to one of the Sultan’s
suite, who on reading it fell to the ground and presently rising
placed it upon his head.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the officer who
took the letter caused the Bhang-eater and his comrade enter the
presence, and the Sultan catching sight of them commanded them
to be seated in a private stead where none other man was. His
bidding was obeyed; and at noontide he sent them a tray of food
for dinner and also coffee; and the same was done at sundown.
But as soon as supper-tide came the Sultan prayed and recited
sections of Holy Writ, as was his wont, until two hours had passed
when he ordered the twain be summoned; and when they stood in
the presence and salam’d to him and blessed him the King returned
their salute and directed them to be seated. Accordingly they sat down
and quoth the Sultan to the Bhang-eater, “Where be the man who
gave you the writ?” Quoth the other, “O King of the Age, there
were two men who came to us and said:——Why go ye not to
the King? Belike he will gift you and largesse you. Our reply
was:——We know him not and we fear lest his folk drive us away.
So one of them said to us, I will write thee a note to his address
for we know him of old, inasmuch as both of us learned to read
in the same school. Accordingly he indited it and sealed it and
gave it to us; and coming hither we found his words true and now
we are between his hands.” The Sultan enquired, “Was there
any lack of civility to the strangers on your part?” and they replied,
“None, save our questioning them and saying, Whence come
ye? whereto they rejoined, We be strangers. Beyond this there
was nothing unpleasant; nothing at all.” “Whither went they?”
asked the King and the other answered, “I wot not.” The
Sultan continued, “Needs must thou bring them to me for ’tis
long since I saw them;” and the other remarked, “O King of the
Age, if again they come to our place we will seize them and
carry them before thee even perforce, but in case they come not, we
have no means to hand.” Quoth the King, “An thou know
them well, when thou catchest sight of them they cannot escape
thee,” and quoth the other, “Yea, verily.” Then the Sultan pursued,
“What did ye with the twain who came before them and
ye wanted to bepiss them?” Now when the Bhang-eater heard
these words his colour paled and his case changed, his limbs
trembled and he suspected that the person which he had insulted
was the Sultan; whereupon the King turned towards him and
seeing in him signs of discomfiture asked, “What is in thy mind,
O Bhang-eater? What hath befallen thee?” The other arose
forthright and kissing ground cried, “Pardon, O King of the
Age, before whom I have sinned.” The Sovran asked, “How
didst thou know this?” and he answered, “Because none other was
with us and news of us goeth not out of doors; so needs must thou
have been one of the twain and he who wrote the writ was thyself;
for well we know that the kings read not in schools. Thou
and thy friend did come in disguise to make merry at our expense;
therefore pardon us, O King of the Age, for mercy is a quality of
the noble, and Almighty Allah said, ‘Whoso pardoneth and benefitteth
his reward is with Allah,’ and eke He said, ‘And the stiflers
of wrath and the pardoners of mankind and Allah loveth the
doers of good.’”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6912" id="noteref-6912" epub:type="noteref">6912</a> Herewith the Sultan smiled and said, “No harm
shall befal thee, O Bhang-eater! Thine excuse is accepted and
thy default pardoned, but, O thou clever fellow, hast thou no tale
to tell us?” He replied, “O King of the Age, I have a story
touching myself and my wife which, were it graven with needle-gravers
upon the eye-corners were a warning to whoso would be
warned. But I strave against her on my own behalf, withal she
overcame me and tyrannised over me by her contrivance.” “What
is it?” asked the King; so the man began to relate the</p>

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Bhang-eater
said to the Sultan:——I had no property save a single bull and
poverty confused my wits. So I resolved to sell Roger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6913" id="noteref-6913" epub:type="noteref">6913</a> and going
to the Bazar stood therein expecting someone to buy it, but none
came to me until the last of the day. At that time I drove it
forth and dragged it off till we reached half-way to my home,
where I came upon a tree and sat down to rest in the cool
shade. Now I had somewhat of Bhang with me, also a trifle of
bread which I brought out and ate, and after I drank a draught
of water from the spring. Presently the Bhang began to wobble
in my brains and behold a bird in the tree-top which men call a
Magpie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6914" id="noteref-6914" epub:type="noteref">6914</a> fell a-cawing, so I said to her, “Thou, O Mother of
Solomon, hast thou a mind to buy the bull?” and she cawed
again. I continued, “Whatso price ever thou settest upon the
bull, at that will I cede it to thee.” Again a croak, and I
“Haply thou hast brought no money?” Another croak and
cried I, “Say the word and I will leave the bull with thee till
next Friday when thou wilt come and pay me its price.” But
she still cawed, and I, whenever she opened beak, O King of the
Age, fancied that she bespake me and wanted the bull. But all
this was of the excess of my Bhang which kept working in my
brains and I mistook the croaking for her conversing. Accordingly
I left with her the bull bound to the tree and turned towards my
village; and, when I went in to my wife, she asked me anent the
bull and I told her of my selling it to the Mother of Solomon.
“Who may she be?” asked my rib, and I replied, “She dwelleth
in yonder tree;” whereat my spouse rejoined, “Allah compensate
thee with welfare.” So I awaited patiently the appointed term;
then, after swallowing somewhat of Bhang, I repaired to the tree
and sat beneath it when, lo and behold! the pie cawed and I cried
to her, “Hast thou brought the coin?” A second caw! Then said
I, “Come hither and bring me the money.” A third caw! Hereat
I waxed wroth and arose and taking up a bittock of brick I threw
it at her as she sat perched upon the tree, whereupon she flew
off and alit upon an ‘old man’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6915" id="noteref-6915" epub:type="noteref">6915</a> of clay hard by. So it occurred
to my mind, “By Allah, the Mother of Solomon biddeth me follow
her and recover the value of the bull from yonder ‘old man.’”
Presently I went up to it and digging therein suddenly came upon
a crock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6916" id="noteref-6916" epub:type="noteref">6916</a> full of gold wherefrom I took ten ashrafis, the value of
the bull, and returned it to its place, saying, “Allah ensure thy
weal, O Mother of Solomon.” Then I walked back to my village
and went in to my wife and said, “By Allah, verily the Mother
of Solomon is of the righteous! Lookye, she gave me these ten
golden ducats to the price of our Roger.” Said my wife, “And
who may be the Mother of Solomon?” and I told her all that had
befallen me especially in the matter of the crock of gold buried
in the ‘old man.’ But after she heard my words she tarried until
sundown; then, going to the land-mark she dug into it and
carrying off the crock brought it home privily. But I suspected
her of so doing and said to her, “O woman, hast thou taken the
good of the Mother of Solomon (and she of the righteous) after
we have received from her the price of our Roger out of her own
moneys? And hast thou gone and appropriated her property?
By Allah, an thou restore it not to its stead even as it was, I will
report to the Wálí that my wife hath happened upon treasure-trove.”
And so saying I went forth from her. Then she arose
and got ready somewhat of dough for cooking with flesh-meat and,
sending for a fisherman, bade him bring her a few fishes fresh-caught
and all alive, and taking these inside the house she drew sweet
water and sprinkled them therewith, and lastly she placed the
dough and meat outside the house ready for nightfall. Presently
I returned and we supped, I and she; but ’twas my firm resolve
to report my wife’s find to the Chief of Police. We slept together
till midnight when she awoke me saying, “O man, I have dreamed
a dream, and this it is, that the sky hath rained down drink and
meat and that the fishes have entered our house.” I replied to
her of my folly and the overmuch Bhang which disported in my
head, “Let us get up and look.” So we searched the inside of the
house and we found the fishes, and the outside where we came upon
the doughboy and flesh-meat; so we fell to picking it up, I and
she, and broiling it and eating thereof till morning. Then said I,
“Do thou go and return the moneys of Solomon’s Mother to their
own place.” But she would not and flatly refused.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Bhang-eater
continued:—I said to my wife, “Do thou go and return
the moneys of Solomon’s Mother to their own place;” but she
would not and flatly refused. Then I repeated<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6917" id="noteref-6917" epub:type="noteref">6917</a> my words but
without avail, so I flew into a fury and leaving her ceased not
trudging till I found the Wali and said to him, “O my lord, my
wife Such-an-one hath hit upon a hoard and ’tis now with her.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6918" id="noteref-6918" epub:type="noteref">6918</a>
The Chief of Police asked, “O man, hast thou seen it?” and I
answered, “Yes.” So he sent a body of his followers to bring her
before him and when she came said to her, “O woman, where
is the treasure trove?” Said she, “O my lord, this report is a
baseless;” whereupon the Chief of Police bade her be led to jail.
They did his bidding and she abode in the prison a whole day,
after which the Wali summoned her and repeated his words to her
adding, “An thou bring not the hoard I will slay thee and
cast thy corpse into the bogshop<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6919" id="noteref-6919" epub:type="noteref">6919</a> of the Hammam.” The woman
(my wife) rejoined, “O my lord, I never found aught;” and
when he persisted threatening her with death she cried, “O my
lord, wherefore oppress me on this wise and charge such load
of sin upon thine own neck? I never came upon treasure at all,
at all!” The Chief of Police retorted, “My first word and my
last are these:——Except thou bring the treasure trove I will slay
thee and cast thee into the jakes.” Herewith quoth she, “O my
lord, ask my husband where it was I hit upon the hoard and at
what time, by day or by night,” and the Wali’s men cried, “By
Allah, these her words are just and right, nor is therein aught of
harm.” So he sent to summon me and asked me, “O man, when
did thy wife hit upon the hoard?” I answered, “O my lord,
she found it on the night when the skies rained drink and food
and fishes.” Now when the Wali heard my words he said to
me, “O man, the skies are not wont to shed aught save rain-water;
and a man in his right wits speaketh not such speech as this.”
Said I, “By the life of thy head, O my lord, they did rain
all three of them;” but the officers cried, “O my lord, verily
this man be Jinn-mad and his wife who telleth plain truth is
wronged by him: the fellow deserveth confining in the Máristán.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6920" id="noteref-6920" epub:type="noteref">6920</a>
Accordingly the Chief of Police bade the men set the woman
free and let her wend her ways and seize me and throw me
into the madhouse. They did his bidding and I remained there
the first day and the second till the third when my wife said
to herself, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great! By the Lord, needs must I go
and relieve my husband from Bedlam and charge him never again
to speak of that treasure trove.” So she came to the Maristan
and entering said to me, “Ho, Such-an-one, if any ask of
thee saying:—What do the skies rain?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6921" id="noteref-6921" epub:type="noteref">6921</a> do thou make answer,
They rain water! Furthermore if they inquire of thee, Do
they ever rain drink and food and fishes? reply thou, This is
clean impossible, nor can such thing ever take place! Then
haply they will say to thee, How many days are in the week;
and do thou say, Seven days and this day be such a day! Lastly
have a guard on thyself when speaking.” I rejoined, “’Tis
well, and now hie thee forth and buy me half a faddah’s worth
of Bhang, for during these days I have not eaten aught thereof.”
So she went and bought me somewhat of food and of Hashish:——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Bhang-eater’s
wife fared forth and brought back somewhat of food and
of Hashish: then returning to the Maristan (he continued) she
gave both to me and I ate of them, after which I said to her,
“Let us up and be off!” whereto she, “And when we go to the
Wali what wilt thou say?” Then the Bhang wrought in my
brains and I cried, “O bawd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6922" id="noteref-6922" epub:type="noteref">6922</a> O my nice young lady, well
thou wottest that the skies did rain flesh and drink and fishes!
Why then didst thou not tell the truth before the Chief of
Police?” Thereupon the Manager of the Madhouse cried to
me, “O fellow, this is the babble of madmen!” and I, “By
Allah, I ate of them boiled; and doubtless the same kind of
rain fell in your house.” The other exclaimed, “There be nor
doubt nor hesitation anent the insanity of one who sayeth such
say!” Now all this was related by the Bhang-eater to the
Sultan who marvelled and asked him, “What could have made
thee go to the Manager and recount to him such absurdities?”
But the Bhang-eater resumed, saying, “I dwelt in the Maristan
twenty days until at last having no Bhang to eat I came to
my senses and confessed that the skies shed only rain-water,
that the week containeth seven days and that this day be
such-and-such; in fact I discoursed like a man in his right mind.
So they discharged me and I went my ways.” But when the
Kazi heard this tale he cried out to the Sultan, “O King of
the Age, my story is still more wondrous than this, which is only
a prank played by a wife. My name was originally Abú Kásim
al-Tambúrí<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6923" id="noteref-6923" epub:type="noteref">6923</a> and I was appointed Kazi after a neat thing I did,
and if thou, O our lord the Sultan, desire to be told of the
adventures which befel me and of the clever trick wherefor
they made me a judge, deign give thy commandment and I
will commence it.” Quoth the Sultan, “Recount to us why and
where they entitled thee Kazi,” and the judge began to relate</p>

<div>

  <h3 class="c012"><em>HOW DRUMMER ABU KASIM BECAME A KAZI.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c013">There was once, O King of the Age, a merchant and a man
of Bassorah who went about trading with eunuchs and slave-boys
and who bore his goods in bales<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6924" id="noteref-6924" epub:type="noteref">6924</a> from Bassorah to Ajam-land
there to sell them and to buy him other merchandise
for vending in Syria. On this wise he tarried a long while until
one year of the years he packed up his property, as was his
wont, and fared forth with it to Persia. But at that time there
fortuned to be a famine and when he arrived at one of the
cities of Ajam-land, where formerly the traders bought his goods,
on this occasion none of them would come near him. In such
case he continued a long while till at last a Khwájah appeared
before him, a man who owned abundant riches in Persia, but
his home was distant three days from the place. The visitor
asked saying, “O Bassorite, wilt thou sell me thy stock-in-trade?”
whereto the other answered, “And how? Of course I’ll sell
it!” So the buyer opened the gate of bidding and offered
such-and-such; but the Bassorah man cried, “Allah openeth.”
Then the purchaser added somewhat and the seller rejoined,
“Give me yet more!” At last the buyer exclaimed, “I will
give nothing more than ‘Anaught’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6925" id="noteref-6925" epub:type="noteref">6925</a>;” and the seller accepted
the offer saying, “May Allah grant us gain!” Thereupon
the Persian Khwajah took over all the goods from the vendor and
next day the twain met to settle money-matters. Now I, O
King of the Age, happened to be abiding in that city. The
seller received from the buyer payment in full nor did anything
remain; but after, the Bassorah man said to his customer, “Thou
still owest me the ‘Anaught,’ which thou must hand over to me.”
The other replied jeeringly, “And the ‘Anaught’ is a naught;
to wit, no thing;” but the Bassorite rejoined, “Here with that
‘Anaught’!” Upon this a violent ruffle befel between them,
the cause was carried before the King and payment was required
in the Divan, for the Bassorite still demanded from the purchaser
his “Anaught.” The Sultan asked, “And what be this
‘Anaught’?” and the Bassorah man answered, “I wot not,
O King of the Age;” whereat the Sultan marvelled.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night,
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
marvelled at the action of this Bassorite and his saying, “Give me
my ‘Anaught!’” Presently the tidings of that cause reached me,
O King; so I went to the Divan which was thronged with folk and
all present kept saying, “How would it be if this ‘Anaught’ were
a fraud or a resiliation of the contract?” Thereupon the Sultan
exclaimed, “Whoso shall settle this case, to him verily will I be
bountiful.” So I came forward, O King of the Age, thinking of
a conceit and kissed ground and said to him, “I will conclude this
cause,” and he rejoined, “An thou determine it and dispose of it
I will give thee largesse; but if not, I will strike off thy head.” I
rejoined, “To hear is to obey.” Then I bade them bring a large
basin which could hold a skinful of water and ordered them fill
it; after which I called out to the Bassorite, “Draw near,” and
he drew near. All this and the King looked on and kept his eyes
fixed upon us. Then I cried to the claimant, “Close thy fist!”
and he did accordingly, and again I commanded him to close it and
to keep it tight closed. He obeyed my bidding and I continued
“Dip thy neave into the basin,” and he dipped it. Presently I
asked, “Is thy hand in the water and thy fist closed?” and he
replied, “It is.” Then said I, “Withdraw it,” and he withdrew it,
and I cried, “Open thy neave,” and he opened it. Then I asked
“What thing hast thou found therein?” and he answered, “A
naught;” whereupon I cried to him, “Take thine ‘Anaught’ and
wend thy ways.” Hereupon the Sultan said to the Bassorite,
“Hast thou taken thine ‘Anaught,’ O man?” and said he “Yes.”
Accordingly the King bade him gang his gait. Then the Sultan gifted
me with costly gifts and named me Kazi; and hence, O King of the
Age, is the cause of the title in the case of one who erst was Abu
Kasim the Drummer. Hereat quoth the Sultan, “Relate to us
what rare accident befel thee in thy proper person.” So the judge
began to recount</p>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_b212a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>
<p class="c013">Once upon a time, O King of the Age, I had a slipper which
hardly belonged to its kind nor ever was there seen a bigger. Now
one day of the days I waxed aweary of it and sware to myself that
I would never wear it any more; so in mine anger I flung it away
and it fortuned to fall upon the flat roof of a Khwájah’s house
where the stucco was weakest. Thence it dropped through,
striking a shelf that held a number of phials full of the purest
rose-water and the boarding yielded breaking all the bottles and
spilling their contents. The house-folk heard the breakage
ringing and rattling; so they crowded one after other to discover
what had done the damage and at last they found my papoosh
sprawling amiddlemost the room. Then they made sure that the
shelf had not been broken except by the violence of that slipper,
and they examined it when, behold, the house-master cried, saying,
“This be the papoosh of Abu Kasim the Drummer.” Hereupon
he took it and carried it to the Governor who summoned me and
set me before him; then he made me responsible for the phials and
whatso was therein and for the repairing of the terrace-roof and
upraising it again. And lastly he handed to me the slipper which
was exceedingly long and broad and heavy and, being cruel old it
showed upwards of an hundred and thirty patches nor was it
unknown to any of the villagers. So I took it and fared forth and,
being angered with the article, I resolved to throw it into some
dark hole or out-of-the-way place;——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
deeds of fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Abu Kasim the
Drummer continued to the Sultan: I resolved to throw it into
some dark hole or out-of-the-way-place; and presently I came to
the watercloset of the Hammam and cast it into the conduit
saying, “Now shall none ever see it again; nor shall I be troubled
with its foul aspect for the rest of my life.” Then I returned
home and abode there the first day and the second, but about noon
on the third a party of the Governor’s men came and seized me
and bore me before him; and no sooner did he see me than he
cried out, “Throw him!” Accordingly they laid me out at
fullest length and gave me an hundred cuts with a scourge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6926" id="noteref-6926" epub:type="noteref">6926</a> which
I bore stoutly and presently said, “O my Sultan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6927" id="noteref-6927" epub:type="noteref">6927</a> what be the cause
of this fustigation and wherefor do they oppress me?” Said he,
“O man, the conduit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6928" id="noteref-6928" epub:type="noteref">6928</a> of the jakes attached to the Mosque was
choked by thy slipper and the flow, unable to pass off, brimmed
over, whereby sundry houses belonging to the folk were wrecked.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6929" id="noteref-6929" epub:type="noteref">6929</a>
I replied, “O my lord, can a slipper estop the flowing of a water
that feedeth a Hammam?” Thereupon the Governor said to me,
“Take it away and if any find it in his place and again bring me
a complaint thereanent, I will cut off thy head.” So they haled
me away after tossing my slipper to me, and I repaired to the
Efendi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6930" id="noteref-6930" epub:type="noteref">6930</a> of the town and said to him, “O our lord, I have a complaint
against this Papoosh which is not my property nor am I its
owner: prithee do thou write me a deed to such purport between
me and the Slipper and all who pass down this road.” The
Efendi replied, “O man, how shall I write thee a deed between
thee and thy Papoosh, which is a senseless thing? Nay, take it thyself
and cut it up and cast it into some place avoided of the folk.”
Accordingly I seized it and hacked it with a hatchet into four
pieces which I threw down in the four corners of the city, saying
to myself the while, “By Allah, I shall nevermore in my life hear
any further of its adventures;” and walked away barefoot. But
I had thrown one bit under a bridge that crossed a certain of the
small canals; and the season was the dries, wherefore it collected
a heap of sand which rose thereupon, and the wind whenever it
blew brought somewhat of dust and raised the pile higher until the
archway was blocked up by a mound. Now when the Níl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6931" id="noteref-6931" epub:type="noteref">6931</a> flooded
and reached that archway the water was dammed up and ceased
running, so the townsfolk said, “What may be the matter? The
Nile-inundation hath reached the bridge but cannot pass under it.
Come let us inspect the archway.” They did so and presently
discovered the obstacle; to wit, the mound before the arch which
obstructed the waterway; whereupon a party kilted their clothes
and waded into the channel that they might clear it. But when
they came to the mound-base they found my quarter-slipper, and
they exclaimed with one cry, “This be the Papoosh of Abu
Kasim the Drummer!” But as soon as the tidings reached me,
I fared away, flying from that town, and while so doing was
met by my comrade, yonder Bhang-eater; so we agreed that we
would travel together and he companied me till we came to this
city, e’en as thou seest us, O our lord the Sultan. Thereupon
the King said to them, “Do ye twain abide with me amongst my
servants; but I have a condition with you which is that ye be
righteous in your service and that ye be ready to join my séance
every night after supper-tide.” Then he cautioned them against
disobedience and quoth he, “Be ye not deluded by becoming my
companions nor say to yourselves, We be the assessors of the
King; for that the byword declareth:——Whenas the King sitteth
beware of his severity, and be not refractory whenever he shall say
to thee ‘Do.’” They agreed to this condition and each whispered
his mate, “Do thou have a care to act righteously!” Then they
left the King nor did they see him again till one day of the days
when behold, a Khwajah appeared before the Sultan——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that one day of the days,
behold a Khwajah appeared before the Sultan and said, “’Tis not
lawful in Allah’s sight, O King of the Age, that a Bhang-eater
should propose to dishonour me in the person of my daughter and
load me with infamy amongst His worshippers saying the while:—I
am of the King’s suite.” Now the cause of the merchant’s
complaint was as follows. One day of the days the Bhang-eater
was passing by under the latticed window of the Khwajah’s home
when by decree of the Decreer, the daughter of the house was
looking out at the casement and was solacing herself by observing
all who walked the street. Perchance the Bhang-eater’s glance
fell upon the maiden and that sight of eyes entailed a thousand
sighs, so he said to himself, “By Allah, if I meet not this maiden,
although it be only once, I shall die of a broken heart nor shall
any one know of my death.” He then took to passing under the
window every day and to gazing upwards and to tarrying there
from morning-tide to set of sun; but the more he looked the less
he saw of her because Fortune which was fair to him the first time
had now turned foul. So he continued in this condition for a
while, coming every day to look at the lattice and seeing naught.
Presently his case became strait and ill health entered his frame
for love to the merchant’s daughter; and by reason of its excess
he betook himself to his pillow turning and tossing right and left
and crying, “O her eyes! O her loveliness! O her stature! O
her symmetrical grace!” But as he was repeating these words
behold, an old woman came in to him and, seeing his concern and
chagrin, accosted him and said, “No harm to thee!” Quoth he,
“Ah, my reverend mother, unless thou come to my aid I perish,”
and quoth she, “What is upon thy mind?” So he disclosed to
her all he felt of fondness and affection for the Khwajah’s daughter
and she rejoined, “Thou wilt never win to thy wish in this matter
except through me.” Then she left him and repaired to her own
place, pondering the wiles of women, till she entered her house
and there she donned a woollen robe and hung three rosaries
around her neck, after which she hent a palm-staff in hand and
set out for the merchant’s quarters. She ceased not walking till
she reached the place and entered in her garb of a religious
mendicant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6932" id="noteref-6932" epub:type="noteref">6932</a> crying out, “Allah, there is no god but the God!
extolled be Allah! Allah be with you all!” When the girl,
whose name was Sitt al-Husn—the Lady of Beauty—heard these
words she met her, hoping for a blessing, and saying, “O my
mother, pray for me!” and the old woman responded, “The name
of Allah be upon thee! Allah be thy safeguard!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6933" id="noteref-6933" epub:type="noteref">6933</a> Then she
sat down and the damsel came and took seat beside her; so likewise
did the girl’s mother and both sought a blessing from her and
conversed together till about noon when she arose and made the
Wuzú-ablution and span out her prayers, whilst those present
exclaimed, “By Allah this be a pious woman!” When her
orisons were ended they served up dinner to her; but she said,
“I’m fasting;” whereat they increased in love and belief herwards
and insisted upon her abiding with them until sunset that she
might break her fast within their walls. On such wise she acted
but it was all a fraud. Then they persisted in keeping her for the
night; so she nighted with them, and when it was morn she arose
and prayed and mumbled words, some intelligible and others not
to be understanded of any, while the household gazed upon her
and, whenever she would move from place to place, supported her
with their hands under her armpits. At last, when it was mid-forenoon
she fared forth from them albeit their intent was not to
let her depart. But early on the next day she came in to them
and all met her with greetings and friendly reception, kissing her
hands and bussing her feet; so she did as she had done on the
first day and in like guise on the third while they showed her
increased honour and worship. On the fourth day she came to
them, as was her wont, and they prayed her be seated; however she
refused and said, “I have a daughter whom I am about to marry
and the bridal festivities will be in my house; but I come to you
at this hour to let you know my desire that Sitt al-Husn may
accompany me and be present at my girl’s wedding-feast and thus
she will gain a blessing.” Her mother replied, “We dread lest
somewhat befal her,” but the ancient woman rejoined, “Fear not
for her as the Hallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6934" id="noteref-6934" epub:type="noteref">6934</a> are with her!” Thereupon cried the girl,
“There is no help but that I accompany her and be present at
her daughter’s wedding ceremony and enjoy the spectacle and take
my pleasure.” The mother said, “’Tis well;” and the old trot
added, “I will go and return within this moment.” So saying,
she went off as one aweary to the house of the Bhang-eater and
told him what she had done; then she returned to the maiden
whom she found drest and decorated and looking her best. So she
took the girl and fared forth with her——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”

    <div>The Four Hundred and Fourth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the ancient woman took
the girl and fared forth with her and led her to the Bhang-eater’s
house and brought her in to him who, seeing her in all her beauty
and loveliness, arose forthright and his wits fled him and he drew
near to her of his excessive love herwards. Therewith the “Lady
of Beauty” understood that the old woman was an accursed procuress
who had beguiled her in order to bring her and the man
together. So of her cleverness and clear intelligence she said to
her lover, “O my brave, whoso expecteth a visit of his beloved
getteth ready somewhat of meat and somewhat of fruit and somewhat
of wine, that their pleasure may be perfected; and, if thou
purpose love-liesse we will pass the night in this place.” Quoth
the Bhang-eater, “By Allah, O my lady, thou speakest sooth but
what shall we do at such hour as this?” and quoth she, “Hie
thee to the market-street and bring all whereof I spoke.” Said
he, “Hearkening and obedience,” and said she, “I will sit down,
I and this my mother in this place, the while thou goest and
comest.” He rejoined, “A sensible saying!” and forthright fared
from her intending for the Bazar to bring the requisites; and he was
right gladsome nor knew what was prepared for him in the hidden
future. Now as soon as he went the damsel arose and without
making aught of noise locked the door closely upon herself and
the old trot: then she wandered about the rooms and presently
came upon a butcher’s chopper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6935" id="noteref-6935" epub:type="noteref">6935</a> which she seized. Hereupon
tucking up her sleeves above her elbows, in the firmness of her
heart she drew near the old crone until she was hard by her right
and so clove her skull asunder that she fell weltering in her blood
and her ghost fled her flesh. After this the damsel again went
about the house and all worth the taking she took, leaving whatso
was unworthy, till she had collected a number of fine robes which
the man had brought together after he had become a cup-companion
of the Sultan; and, lastly, she packed the whole in a sheet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6936" id="noteref-6936" epub:type="noteref">6936</a>
and went forth therewith. Now the season was morning but The
Veiler veiled her and none met her on the way until she reached
her home and went in to her mother whom she found awaiting her
and saying, “By Allah, to day my girl hath tarried long at the
bridal festivities of the Ascetic’s daughter.” And behold Sitt al-Husn
came in to her carrying a large sheet stuffed with raiment,
and as her mother saw her agitated and in disorder she questioned
her of her case and of what was packed in the bundle. But the
girl, who returned no reply and could not speak one syllable for
the emotion caused by the slaughter of the ancient woman, fell to
the ground in a fit. Her swoon endured from noon until eventide,
her mother sitting at her head the while and sorrowing for her
condition. But about set of sun behold, in came her father who
found his daughter aswoon; so he questioned his wife who began
by recounting to him what they had noted in the old woman of
prayer and display of devotion and how she had told them, “I
have a daughter whom I am about to marry and the bridal festivities
will be in my house.” “And,” pursued the mother, “she
invited us to visit her; so at undurn-tide I sent with her the girl;
who at noontide came back bringing somewhat wrapped up and
bundled, which be this. But when she entered the house she fell
to the floor in a fainting fit and she is even as thou seest; nor do
I know what befel her.” Then the father rose up and besprinkled
somewhat of water upon her face which revived her and she said,
“Where am I?” whereto said he, “Thou art with us.” And when
she had recovered and returned to her senses, and her condition
was as before the swoon, she told them of the old woman and her
ill designs and of her death and lastly how the clothes had been
brought by herself from the house of the Bhang-eater. As soon as
her sire had heard her words, he set out from his home and sought
the Sultan.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that whilst the
Sultan was sitting behold, the Khwajah came in and complained
to him of the Bhang-eater, whereupon he ordered a company to go
fetch the accused and they went off and found him not. So they
returned and reported accordingly. Such was the cause of the
Khwajah coming to the King and such was the case with them;
but as regards the Bhang-eater, when he went off rejoicing to the
Bazar in order to buy whatso the merchant’s daughter had asked
him, he brought many a thing wherewith he returned to his lodging.
However as he returned he beheld the old woman slaughtered
and weltering in her blood and he found nothing at all of the
choice articles wherewith his house was fulfilled; so he fell to
quoting this couplet:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6937" id="noteref-6937" epub:type="noteref">6937</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he beheld that condition of things he turned from his
home in haste and without stay or delay left it about the hour of mid-afternoon
and fared forth from the city. There he found a caravan
bound to some bourne or other, so he proceeded therewith hardly
believing in his own safety and he ceased not accompanying the
Cafilah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6938" id="noteref-6938" epub:type="noteref">6938</a> for the space of five days till it made the city the
travellers sought, albeit he was fatigued and footsore from the
stress of hardships and weariness he had endured. So he entered
the place and wandered about until he found a Khan wherein
he hired him a cell by way of nighting-stead and every day he
would go forth to seek service for wages whereby he might make
a livelihood. Now one day of the days a woman met him face
to face on the highway and said to him, “Dost thou do service?”
and said he, “Indeed I do, O my lady.” She continued, “There
is a wall about my place which I desire to level and build another
in lieu thereof for that ’tis old and very old.” He replied to her,
“’Tis well,” and she took him and repaired with him to her house
and showing him the wall in question handed to him a pickaxe
and said, “Break it down as much as thou art able be it for two
or three days, and heap up the stones in one place and the dried
mud in another.” He replied, “Hearkening and obedience;”
after which she brought to him somewhat of food and of water
and he ate and drank and praised Almighty Allah. After this he
rose and began breaking down the wall and he ceased not working
and piling up the stones and the dried mud until it was sunset
time when the woman paid him to his wage ten faddahs and
added a something of food which he took and turned towards his
own cell. As soon as it was the second day he repaired to the
house of the woman who again gave him somewhat to break his
fast and he fell to felling the wall even as he had done on the first
day and he worked till noon; but when it was midday and all
the household was asleep, lo and behold! he found in the middle
of the foundation a crock<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6939" id="noteref-6939" epub:type="noteref">6939</a> full of gold. So he opened it and considered
its contents whereat he was rejoiced and he went forth
without leisure or loss of time seeking his own cell and when he
reached it he locked himself within for fear lest any look upon
him. Then he opened the crock and counted therein one hundred
dinars which he pouched in his purse and stowed away in his
breast-pocket. Presently he returned, as he was, to break down the
rest of the wall and whilst he was trudging along the highway
suddenly he sighted a box surrounded by a crowd of whom none
knew what might be its contents and its owner was crying out,
“For an hundred gold pieces!” Thereupon the Bhang-eater
went forwards saying to himself, “Buy thee yonder box for the
hundred dinars and thy luck be thy lot, for if there be inside of it
aught of wonderful ’tis well, and if otherwise thou shalt stand by
thy bad bargain.” So he drew near the broker<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6940" id="noteref-6940" epub:type="noteref">6940</a> and said to him,
“This box for how much?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6941" id="noteref-6941" epub:type="noteref">6941</a> and the other answered, “For an
hundred gold dinars!” But when he questioned him as to its
contents the man replied, “I know not; whoso taketh it his luck
be his lot.” Thereupon he brought out to him the hundred ducats
and the broker made over to him the box which he charged upon
his shoulders and carried off to his cell. There arrived he bolted
himself in and opened the coffer wherein he found a white slave-girl
which was a model of beauty and loveliness and stature and
perfect grace: but she was like one drunken with wine. So he
shook her but she was not aroused when he said to himself, “What
may be the story of this handmaiden?” and he was never tired of
looking upon her while she was in that condition and he kept
saying to himself, “Would Heaven I wot an she be on life or in
death; withal I see her breath coming and going.” Now when it
was about midnight, the handmaiden revived and looking around
and about her, cried, “Where am I?” and said the Bhang-eater,
“Thou, O my lady, art in my home;” whereby she understood
what had befallen her——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Sixth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the handmaiden
understood what had befallen her at the hands of her enemies.
Now the cause thereof was that the Sultan of that city had bought
him for concubine one Kút al-Kulúb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6942" id="noteref-6942" epub:type="noteref">6942</a>, or Heart’s-food hight, and she
became to him the liefest of all the women he before had, amongst
whom his wife, the daughter of his uncle, had been preferred:
but all fell into the rank of the common and from the time he
bought the new handmaid he was wholly occupied with her love
and he never went near the other inmates of his Harem, not even
his cousin. So they were filled with exceeding jealousy against
Heart’s-food the new comer. Now one day of the days the Sultan
went forth to hunt and bird and enjoy the occasion and solace
himself in the gardens together with the Lords of his land, and
they rode on till they found themselves amiddlemost of the waste
pursuing their quarry. But when two days had passed, his wife
together with the women which were concubines arose and invited
all the neighbourhood whereamong was Kut al-Kulub, and she
spread for them a sumptuous banquet and lavished upon the new
comers all manner of attentions and the wife began to play with
her rival and to disport with her until it was thought that she
loved none in the assembly save Heart’s-food; and on such wise
she continued to cheer her and solace her and gambol with her
and make her laugh until the trays were laid and the meats were
dispread and all the guests came forward and fell to eating and
drinking. Thereupon the King’s cousin-wife brought a plate
seasoned with Bhang and set it before the concubine who had no
sooner eaten it and it had settled in her stomach than she trembled
as with sudden palsy and fell to the ground without power of
motion. Then the Queen bade place her in a box and having
locked her therein sent for one who was Shaykh of the Brokers and
committed to him the coffer saying, “Do thou sell it for an hundred
gold pieces whilst it is locked and fast locked and suffer not any
open it, otherwise we will work for the cutting off of thy hands.”
He replied, “To hear is to obey;” and took up the box and went
with it to the market-street where he said to the brokers, “Cry
for sale this coffer at an hundred dinars and if any attempt to
open it, open it not to any by any manner of means.” So they
took their station and made auction of it for an hundred gold
pieces, when by the decree of Destiny the Bhang-eater passed
down the street exulting in his hundred dinars which he had
found in the crock while levelling the wall belonging to the
woman. Thereupon he came up and having paid the price
required carried off his coffer saying in his mind, “My luck is my
livelihood.” After this he went to his own cell and opened it and
found there the handmaid in condition as though drunken with
wine. Such is the history of that concubine Kut al-Kulub and
she fell not into the hand of the Bhang-eater save by the wile and
guile of the Sultan’s cousin-wife. But when she recovered from
her fainting fit and gazed around and understood what had
befallen her she concealed her secret and said to the man, “Verily
this thy cell becometh us not;” and, as she had somewhat of gold
pieces with her and a collar of jewels around her neck worth a
thousand dinars, she brought out for him some money and sent
him forth to hire for them a house in the middle of the quarter
befitting great folk and when this was done she had herself transported
thither. Then she would give him every day spending-money
to buy whatso she ever required and she would cook the
delicatest dishes fit for the eating of the Kings wherewith she fed
herself and her owner. This continued for twenty days when
suddenly the Sultan returned from his hunting party and as soon
as he entered his palace he asked for Kut al-Kulub——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I should relate to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and goodwill! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as soon as
the Sultan returned from the chase he asked after Kut al-Kulub
from his exceeding desire to her, and the daughter of his uncle
told him the tidings saying, “By Allah, O King of the Age, three
days after the time thou faredst forth there came upon her malaise
and malady wherein she abode six days and then she deceased
to the mercy of Almighty Allah.” He exclaimed, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great! Verily we are the Almighty’s and unto Him shall we
return.” Then befel him the extreme of grief and straitness of
breast and he passed that night in exceeding cark and care for
Kut al-Kulub. And when it was morning he sent after the Wazir
and summoned him between his hands and bade him go forth to
the Tigris-bank and there approve some place whereon he might
build a palace which should command all the roads. The Minister
replied, “Hearkening and obeying;” and hied to do his lord’s
bidding taking with him architects<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6943" id="noteref-6943" epub:type="noteref">6943</a> and others, and having found a
piece of level ground he ordered them to measure an hundred ells of
length for the building by a breadth of seventy cubits. Presently
he sent for surveyors and master-masons whom he commanded to
make ready every requisite for the work, of ashlar and lime and
lead; also to dig trenches for the base of the walls. Then they
fell to laying the foundations, and the builders and handicraftsmen
began to pile the stones and prepare the loads while the Wazir
stood by them bidding and forbidding. Now when it was the third
day, the Sultan went forth the Palace to look at the masons and
artizans who were working at the foundations of his new edifice.
And as soon as he had inspected it, it pleased him, so he said to
the Wazir, “Walláhi! none would befit this palace save and except
Kut al-Kulub, when ’twould have been full of significance;” and
so saying he wept with sore weeping at the remembrance of her.
Quoth the Wazir to him, “O King of the Age, have patience
when calamity afflicteth thee, even as said one of them with much
meaning, anent long-suffering:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Be patient under weight of wrath and blow of sore calamities: ✿ The Nights   compressed by Time’s embrace <i><span xml:lang="la">gravidæ miras gerunt res</span></i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6944" id="noteref-6944" epub:type="noteref">6944</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then quoth the Sultan, “’Tis well, O Wazir, I know that patience
is praiseworthy and fretfulness is blameworthy, for indeed quoth
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When Time shall turn on thee, have patience for ’tis best of plight: ✿ Ease   shall pursue unease and naught but suffrance makes it light;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>and by Allah, O Wazir, human nature is never free from sad
thought and remembrance. Verily that damsel pleased me and I
delighted in her; nor can I ever think to find one like her in
beauty and loveliness.” Thereupon the Wazir fell to guiding the
Sultan with fair words until his breast was broadened and the two
began to solace themselves by inspecting the masons. After this
the Sultan would go forth every morning for solace to Tigris-bank
and tidings reached the ears of Kut al-Kulub that her lord was
engaged on building a riverine palace, whereupon she said to the
Bhang-eater, “Day by day we expend money upon our condition,
and our outgoing is without incoming, so ’twere but right that
each morning thou fare and work with the workmen who are
edifying a mansion for the Sultan, inasmuch as the folk declare
that he is of temper mild and merciful and haply thou shalt gain
from him profit and provision.” “O my lady,” he replied, “by
Allah, I have no patience to part with thee or to be far from thee;”
and he said so because he loved her and she loved him, for that
since the time he had found her locked in the box and had looked
upon her he had never required her of her person and this was
indeed from his remembrance, for he bore in mind but too well
what had befallen him from the Khwajah’s daughter. And she on
her side used to say, “’Tis a wondrous thing that yon Bhang-eater
never asketh me aught nor draweth nigh me seeing that I be a
captive of his right hand.” So she said to him, “Assuredly thou
dost love me?” and said he, “How can it be otherwise when
thou art the blood of my life and the light of mine eyes?” “O
light of mine eyes,” she replied, “take this necklace and set it in
thy breast-pocket and go work at the Sultan’s palace, and as often
as thou shalt think of me, do thou take it out and consider it and
smell it and it shall be as if thou wert to see me.” Hearing this
he obeyed her and went forth till he reached the palace where he
found the builders at work and the Sultan and the Wazir sitting in
a Kiosk hard by overseeing the masons and the workmen;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Bhang-eater joined the masons he saw the Sultan and Wazir overseeing
them; and, as soon as the King sighted him, he opened his
breast to him and said, “O man, wilt thou also do work?” and
said the other, “Yes.” So he bade him labour with the builders
and he continued toiling till hard upon noontide, at which time
he remembered his slave-girl and forthright he bowed his head
upon his bosom-pocket and he sniffed thereat. The Wazir saw
him so doing and asked him, “What is the meaning of thy sniffing
at what is in thy poke?” and he answered him, “No matter.”
However the Minister espied him a second time occupied in like
guise and quoth he to the Sultan, “Look, O King of the Age, at yon
labourer who is hiding something in his pocket and smelling
thereat.” “Haply,” responded the Sovran, “there is in his pouch
something he would look at.” However when the Sultan’s glance
happened to fall that way he beheld the Bhang-eater sniffing and
smelling at his poke, so he said to the Wazir, “Walláhi! Verily
this workman’s case is a strange.” Hereupon both fixed their eyes
upon him and they saw him again hiding somewhat in his pouch
and smelling at it. The Wazir cried, “Verily this fellow is a-fizzling
and he boweth his head toward his breast in order that he may
savour his own farts.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6945" id="noteref-6945" epub:type="noteref">6945</a> The Sultan laughed and said, “By Allah,
if he do on this wise ’tis a somewhat curious matter, or perhaps,
O Wazir, he have some cause to account for it; at any rate do thou
call out to him and ask him.” So the Wazir arose and drawing
near to him asked him saying, “Ho, this one!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6946" id="noteref-6946" epub:type="noteref">6946</a> every time thou
fizzlest thou smellest and sniffest at thy fizzlings;” whereto
answered the workman, “Wag not thy tongue with these words
seeing thou art in the presence of a King glorious of degree.”
Quoth the Minister, “What is the matter with thee in this case
that thou art sniffing at thy pocket?” and quoth the labourer,
“Verily my beloved is in my pouch.” The Wazir wondered
hereat and reported the same to the Sultan who cried, “Return to
him and say:—Is it possible that thou display to us thy beloved
who is in thy breast-pocket?” So he returned to him and said,
“Show us what there is in thy pouch.” Now the origin of this
necklace was that the King had bought it for Kut al-Kulub at the
price of a thousand dinars and the damsel had given it to the
Bhang-eater with the sole object that the Sultan might look upon
it and thereby be directed unto her and might learn the reason of
her disappearance and her severance from him. Hereupon the
man brought out to them the necklace from his breast-pocket and
the Sultan on seeing it at once recognized it and wondered how it
had fallen into the hands of that workman; accordingly he asked
who was its owner and the other answered, “It belongeth to the
handmaid whom I bought with an hundred dinars.” Quoth the
Sultan to him, “Is it possible<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6947" id="noteref-6947" epub:type="noteref">6947</a> thou invite us to thy quarters that
we may look upon this damsel;” and quoth the other, “Would
you look upon my slave-girl and not be ashamed of yourselves?
However I will consult her, and if she be satisfied therewith we
will invite you.” They said to him, “This be a rede that is right
and an affair which no blame can excite.” When the day had
reached its term the masons and workmen were dismissed after
they had taken their wage; but as for the Bhang-eater the Sultan
gave him two gold pieces and set him free about sunset tide; so
he fared to his handmaid and informed her of what had befallen
him from the King, adding, “He hath indeed looked upon the
necklace and hath asked me to invite him hither as well as the
Wazir.” Quoth she, “No harm in that; but to-morrow (Inshallah!)
do thou bring all we require for a state occasion of meats
and drinks, and let me have them here by noontide, so they may
eat the early meal. But when he shall ask to buy me of thee
compose thy mind and say thou, No, when he will reply to thee:—Give
me this damsel in free gift. Hereat do thou say:—She is
a present from me to thee; because indeed I am his slave and
bought with his money for one thousand and five hundred dinars;
and thou hadst never become my lord save through my foes who
devised a device against me and who sold me when thou boughtest
me. However the hour of thy prosperity hath now come.” And
when morning morrowed she gave him five gold pieces and said to
him, “Bring for me things that be such and such,” and said he,
“Hearing and obedience.” So he went to the market-street where
he purchased all the supplies wherewith she had charged him and
returned to her forthright. Hereupon she arose and tucking up
her sleeves prepared meats that befitted the King and likewise
she got ready comfits and the daintiest of dainties and sherbets
and she tempered the pastilles and she besprinkled the room with
rose-water and looked to the furniture of the place. About midday
she sent to the Sultan and the Wazir with notice that she was
ready; so the Bhang-eater repaired to the Palace and having gone
in to the presence said, “Have the kindness!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6948" id="noteref-6948" epub:type="noteref">6948</a> The twain arose
without more ado and hied with him privily till they reached his
house and entered therein.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I should relate to you on
the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan and
the Wazir entered the place wherein were the Bhang-eater and the
damsel, and took their seats. Now the meats were ready and
they served up to them the trays and the dishes, when they fell to
and were cheered by the sumptuous viands until they had eaten
after the measure of their sufficiency. And when their hands were
washed, the confections and sherbet and coffee were set before
them, so they ate and were satisfied and gladdened and made
merry. After this quoth the Sultan to the Bhang-eater, “Where
is the damsel?” and quoth the man, “She is here,” whereat he
was commanded to bring her. Accordingly he went off and led
her in and as soon as the King sighted her he recognised her and
ordered her owner to make her over to him and said when he did
so, “O man, wilt thou sell to me this damsel?” But the other
kissed ground before him and replied, “O King of the age, she is
from me a free gift to thee;” and quoth the Sultan, “She is
accepted from thee, O Shaykh, and do thou come and bring her
thyself to the Palace about sundown-time.” He replied, “To hear
is to obey.” And at the hour named he took the damsel and
ceased not faring with her till he brought her to the Serai,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6949" id="noteref-6949" epub:type="noteref">6949</a> where
the Eunuchry met her and took her and carried her in to the Sultan.
But as soon as she entered she nestled in his bosom and he threw
his arms round her neck and kissed her of his excessive desire to
her. Then he asked her saying, “This man who purchased thee,
hath he any time approached thee?” whereto she answered,
“By Allah, O King, from the time he bought me in the box which
he opened and found me alive therein until this present never hath
he looked upon my face, and as often as I addressed him he would
bow his brow earthwards.” Quoth the Sultan, “By Allah, this
wight deserveth an aidance for that he paid down for thee an
hundred dinars and he hath presented thee in free gift to me.”
Now when morrowed the morning the King sent after the Bhang-eater
and summoned him between his hands and bestowed upon
him one thousand five hundred dinars with a suit of royal raiment,
after which he presented to him, by way of honourable robe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6950" id="noteref-6950" epub:type="noteref">6950</a> a
white slave girl. He also set apart for him an apartment and made
him one of his boon companions. So look thou, O hearer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6951" id="noteref-6951" epub:type="noteref">6951</a> how
it happened to this Bhang-eater from the Khwajah’s daughter and
his love herwards; how he failed to win her and how he gained of
blows whatso he gained; and after what prosperity befel him from
the part of Kut Al-Kulub. And ever afterwards when the Sultan
would ride out for disport or for the hunt and chase he would take
the man with him. Presently of the perfection of his prosperity
this Bhang-eater fully mastered the affairs of the kingdom, both
its income and its outgo, and his knowledge embraced all the
regions and cities which were under the rule of his lord. Furthermore,
whenever he would counsel the King, his advice was found
to be in place and he was consulted upon all State affairs, and
whenever he heard of any business he understood its inner as well
as its outer meaning until the Sultan and the Wazir both sought
rede of him, and he would point out to them the right and unright,
and that which entaileth trouble and no trouble, when they
could fend it off and overthrow it or by word or by deed of hand.
Now one day of the many days the King was in a certain of his
gardens a-solacing himself with the sights when his heart and
stomach became full of pain and he fell ill and his illness grew
upon him, nor did he last four days ere he departed to the mercy
of Allah Almighty. As he had no issue, either son or daughter,
the country remained without a King for three days, when the
Lords of the land forgathered and agreed upon a decision, all and
some, that they would have no King or Sultan save the Wazir and
that the man the Bhang-eater should be made Chief Councillor.
So they agreed upon this matter and their words went forth to the
Minister who at once took office. After this he gave general
satisfaction and lavished alms on the mean and miserable, also on
the widows and orphans, when his fame was bruited abroad and it
dispread far and wide till men entitled him the “Just Wazir” and
in such case he governed for a while of time.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate

    <div>The Four Hundred and Tenth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Wazir
governed for a while of time with all justice of rule so that the
caravans spread abroad the name and fame of him throughout every
city and all the countries. Presently there befel him an affair
between two women which were sister-wives to one man.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6952" id="noteref-6952" epub:type="noteref">6952</a> Now
these had conceived by him in the same month and when the time
of their pregnancy had passed, the twain were delivered in the
same place at the same hour and the midwife was one and the
same. One brought forth a babe but it was a daughter which
incontinently died and the other a man-child who lived. The
women quarrelled and fought about the boy-babe and both of them
said, “This is my child;” and there befel between them exceeding
contention and excessive hostility. So they carried their cause
before the divines and the Olema and the head men of the place,
yet did none of them know how to decide between the twain and
not a few of the folk said, “Let each woman take the child to her
for a month,” whilst others declared that they might keep it
between them at all times, whilst of the women one said, “’Tis
well: this be <em>my</em> boy!” and the other declared “’Tis well, this be
<em>my</em> son!” nor could any point out to which of the women the boy
belonged. So the town’s people were gathered together and said,
“None can determine this dispute except the Just Wazir;” and
they agreed upon this, so that the husband of the two women and
sundry of his associates arose and took the twain of them and
travelled with them to hear the Minister’s judgment. Also the
Olema and the great men of the place declared “By Allah, we also
needs must travel with the party and produce the two women and
be present at the Just Wazir’s judgment.” So they all assembled
and followed after the two adversaries, nor did they cease travelling
until they entered the city where the Minister abode. There they
delayed for rest during one day and on the second they all joined
one another and went in to the Wazir and recounted to him the case
of the two women. Hearing this he bowed his brow groundwards
and presently raising it he cried, “Bring me two eggs and void
them of their contents and see that the shells be clean empty.”
Then he commanded that each of the women drain somewhat of
milk from her nipple into the egg-shell till she had filled it. They
did accordingly and set before him the egg-shells brimful when he
said, “Bring me a pair of scales.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6953" id="noteref-6953" epub:type="noteref">6953</a> After this he placed both eggs
in the balance-pan and raising it aloft from its rounded stead perceived
that one was weighty and the other was light. Quoth he,
“The milk of the woman in this egg is the heavier and she is the
mother of the boy-babe whereas the other bare the girl-child and
we know not an it be alive or dead.” Hereat the true mother of
the boy held her peace but the other wailed aloud and said, “’Tis
well: still this be <em>my</em> babe!” Thereupon quoth the Wazir, “I am
about to take the boy and hew him in halves whereof I will give
one to each of you twain.” But the true mother arose and cried
out, “No! O my lord, do not on this wise: I will forfeit my claim
for Allah’s sake;” while the other one exclaimed, “All this is right
good!” Now all the folk of the city who were then standing by
heard these words and looked on; but when this order was pronounced
and the woman was satisfied and declared, “I will take
half the boy,” the Wazir gave orders forthright that they seize her
and hang her; so they hanged her and he gave the babe to the right
mother. Then said they to him, “O our lord, how was it proved
to thee that the boy was the child of this one?” and he said, “It
became evident to me from two sides; in the first place because
her milk was the heavier, so that I knew that the boy was her boy,
and secondly when I commanded:——Let us cut the boy in half, the
real mother consented not to this and the matter was hard upon her
because the child was a slice of her liver, and she said to herself:—His
life is better than his death, even though my sister-wife take
him, at any rate I shall be able to look upon him. But the second
woman designed only to gratify her spite whether the boy died or
not and to harm her sister-wife; so when I saw that she was
contented to have the babe killed, I knew that it was right to do
her die.” Then all who were present of the Lords of the land and
the Olema and divines and notables wondered at the judgment and
exclaimed, “By Allah, well done,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6954" id="noteref-6954" epub:type="noteref">6954</a> O Wazir of the realm.” Now this
history of the Minister’s perspicacity and penetration was spread
abroad and all folk went from his presence and everyone who
had wives that had borne girls took somewhat of milk from the
women and went to each and every of those who had borne boys and
took from them milk in the same quantity as the Wazir had taken, and
weighed it in the scales, when they found that the mothers of males
produced milk that was not equal to, nay it weighed two-fold that
of those who bare girls. Hereupon they said, “It is not right that
we call this Minister only the Just Wazir;” and all were agreed
that he should be titled “The Wazir-wise-in-Allah-Almighty;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6955" id="noteref-6955" epub:type="noteref">6955</a>
and the reason whereof was the judgment which he passed in the
cause between the two women. Now after this it befel him to
deliver a decision more wondrous than the former.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I should relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that to the
Wazir-wise-in-Almighty-Allah there befel between his hands a
strange matter which was as follows. As he was sitting one
day of the days there came in to him unexpectedly two men, of
whom one led a cow and a little colt whilst the second had with
him a mare and a little calf. Now the first who came forward
was the owner of the mare and quoth he, “O my lord, I have a
claim upon this man.” Quoth the Minister, “What be thy claim?”
And the plaintiff continued, “I was going a-morn to the meadow
for pasture and with me was my mare followed by her young one,
her little colt, when yonder man met me upon the road and the
colt began to play and to throw up gravel with its hoofs as is the
wont of horseflesh and draw near to the cow. Hereupon this
man came up and seized it and said, “This colt is the offspring of
my cow,” and so saying he took it away and he gave me his calf,
crying, “Take this which be the issue of thy mare.”” So the
Wazir turning to the master of the cow asked, “O man, what
sayest thou concerning what thy comrade hath spoken?” and the
other answered, “O my lord, in very deed this colt is the produce
of my cow and I brought it up by hand.” Quoth the Wazir, “Is
it right that black cattle should bring forth horses and that horses
should bear cows? indeed the intelligence of an intelligent man
may not compass this;” and quoth the other, “O my lord, Allah
createth whatso He willeth and maketh kine to produce horses and
horses to produce kine.” Hereupon the Minister said to him, “O
Shaykh, when thou seest a thing before thee and lookest thereon
canst thou speak of it in the way of truth?” And the other
assented. Then the Wazir continued addressing the two men,
“Wend your ways at this time and on the morrow be present here
at early morn and let it be at a vacant hour.” Accordingly they
forthright went forth, and the next day early the two men came
to the divan of the Wazir who set before them a she-mouse he had
provided and called for a sack which he filled with earth. And
as the men stood between his hands he said, “Wait ye patiently
without speaking a word;” so they held their peace and presently
he bade them set the sack and the mouse before him and he ordered
the men to load the sack upon the mouse. Both cried, “O our
lord, ’tis impossible that a mouse can carry a sack full of earth,”
when he answered, “How then can a cow bear a colt? and when a
mouse shall be able to bear a sack then shall a cow bear a colt.”
All this and the Sultan was looking out at the latticed window
listening and gazing. Hereupon the Wazir gave an order that
the master of the mare take her colt and the master of the cow
carry off her calf; after which he bade them go about their
business.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan,
whose Minister was the Wazir-wise-in-Allah-Almighty, on a certain
day summoned his Chief Councillor and when he came said to him,
“Verily my breast is straitened and I am beset by unease, so I
desire to hear something which may broaden my bosom;” and
said the other, “O King of the age, by Allah, I have a friend who
is named Mahmúd the ’Ajamí and that man is a choice spirit and
he hath all kind of rare tales and strange anecdotes and wondrous
histories and marvellous adventures.” Said the Sultan, “There is
no help but that thou summon him to us hither and let us hear
from him somewhat.” So the Wazir sent after the Persian and
when the man stood in the presence said to him, “Verily the
Sultan hath summoned thee.” He replied, “Hearing and
obeying,” when he was taken and set before the Sovran and as he
entered he saluted him with the salams of the Caliphs and blessed
him and prayed for him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6956" id="noteref-6956" epub:type="noteref">6956</a> The King returned his greeting and
after seating him said to him, “O Mahmud, at this moment my
breast is indeed straitened and I have heard of thee that thou hast
a store of rare stories which I would that thou cause me hear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6957" id="noteref-6957" epub:type="noteref">6957</a> and
let it be somewhat sweet of speech which shall banish my cark
and my care and the straitness of my breast.” Hereto the other
replied, “Hearing and obeying;” and began to relate the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>TALE OF MAHMUD THE PERSIAN AND THE KURD SHARPER.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6958" id="noteref-6958" epub:type="noteref">6958</a></h3>

<p class="c013">The Sultan was delighted with the ’Ajami’s relation and largessed
him two thousand pieces of gold; after which he returned to his
palace and took seat upon his Divan when suddenly a poor man
appeared before him carrying a load of fruit and greens and
greeted him and prayed for him and expressed a blessing which
the Sultan returned and bade him fair welcome. After which he
asked, “What hast thou with thee, O Shaykh?” and the other
answered, “O King of the Age, I have an offering to thee of fresh
greens and firstfruits;” and the King rejoined, “It is accepted.”
Thereupon the man placed them between his royal hands and
stood up, and the King having removed the cover<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6959" id="noteref-6959" epub:type="noteref">6959</a> found under it
a portion of ordinary cucumbers and sundry curling cucumbers
and bundles of rose-mallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6960" id="noteref-6960" epub:type="noteref">6960</a> which had been placed before him.
So he took thereof some little matter and ate it and was much
pleased and bade the Eunuchry bear the rest into the Harem.
They carried out his commands and the women also were delighted
and having eaten somewhat they distributed the remainder to the
slave-girls. Then said they, “By Allah, this man, the fruit-owner,
deserveth Bakhshísh;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6961" id="noteref-6961" epub:type="noteref">6961</a> so they sent to him by the Eunuch one
hundred gold pieces whereto the Sultan added twain, so the whole
of his gain was three hundred dinars. But the Sultan was much
pleased with the man and a part of the care which he felt was
lightened to him, whereupon asked he, “O Shaykh, knowest thou
aught of boon-companionship with the Kings?” to which the
other answered, “Yes;” for he was trim of tongue and ready of
reply and sweet of speech. Presently the Sultan continued, “O
Shaykh, for this present go back to thy village and give to thy wife
and family that which Allah hath made thy lot.” Accordingly
the man went forth and did as the King bade him; after which he
returned in a short time and went into the presence about set of
sun when he found his liege lord at supper. The King bade him
sit to the trays which he did and he ate after the measure of his
sufficiency, and again when the Sultan looked upon him he was
pleased with him. And when the hour of night-prayers came all
prayed together;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6962" id="noteref-6962" epub:type="noteref">6962</a> then the King invited him to sit down as a cup-companion

<p class="c013">It is told anent a man, one of the Kings of Orient-land, that he
had three sons, of whom the eldest one day of the days heard
the folk saying, “In such a place there is a bird hight the
shrilling Philomelet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6964" id="noteref-6964" epub:type="noteref">6964</a> which transmews everyone who comes to
it into a form of stone.” Now when the heir apparent heard
this report he went to his father and said, “’Tis my desire to
fare forth and to get that marvellous bird;” and said the father,
“O my son, thou wouldst work only to waste thy life-blood and
to deprive us of thee; for that same bird hath ruined Kings
and Sultans, not to speak of Bashas and Sanjáks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6965" id="noteref-6965" epub:type="noteref">6965</a> men in whose
claws<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6966" id="noteref-6966" epub:type="noteref">6966</a> thou wouldst be as nothing.” But the son replied,
“Needs must I go and if thou forbid my going I will kill myself.”
So quoth his father, “There is no Majesty and no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great;” and saith the son,
“Affects are affected and steps are sped towards a world that
is vile and distributed daily bread.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6967" id="noteref-6967" epub:type="noteref">6967</a> Then he said to him, “O
my child, set out upon thy journey and mayest thou win to thy
wish.” Hereupon they prepared for him somewhat of victual and
he went forth on his wayfare. But before departing he took off
his seal-ring from his finger and gave it to his second brother
saying, “O my brother, an this signet press hard upon thy little
finger do thou know and make certain that mishap hath happened
to me.” So the second Prince took it and put it upon his minim
finger, after which the eldest youth farewelled his father and his
mother and his brothers and the Lords of the land and departed
seeking the city wherein the Bird woned. He ceased not travelling
by nights and days, the whole of them, until he reached the
place wherein was the bird Philomelet whose habit it was to
take station upon his cage between mid-afternoon and sunset,
when he would enter it to pass the night. And if any approached
him with intent of capturing him, he would sit afar from the
same and at set of sun he would take station upon the cage
and would cry aloud speaking in a plaintive voice, “Ho thou
who sayest to the mean and mesquin, ‘Lodge!’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6968" id="noteref-6968" epub:type="noteref">6968</a> Ho thou who
sayest to the sad and severed, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who sayest
to the woeful and doleful, ‘Lodge!’” Then if these words were
grievous to the man standing before him and he make reply
“Lodge!” ere the words could leave his lips the Bird would take
a pinch of dust from beside the cage and hovering over the wight’s
head would scatter it upon him and turn him into stone. At
length arrived the youth who had resolved to seize the Bird
and sat afar from him till set of sun: then Philomelet came
and stood upon his cage and cried, “Ho thou who sayest to the
mean and mesquin, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who sayest to the sad
and severed, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who sayest to the woeful and
doleful, ‘Lodge!’” Now the cry was hard upon the young
Prince and his heart was softened and he said, “Lodge!” This
was at the time when the sun was disappearing, and as soon as he
spake the word the Bird took a somewhat of dust and scattered it
upon the head of the youth, who forthright became a stone. At
that time his brother was sitting at home in thought concerning
the wanderer, when behold, the signet squeezed his finger and he
cried, “Verily my brother hath been despoiled of life and done
to death!”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the second
Prince, when the signet squeezed his little finger, cried out saying,
“My brother, by Allah, is ruined and lost; but needs must I also
set forth and look for him and find what hath befallen him.”
Accordingly he said to his sire, “O my father, ’tis my desire to
seek my brother;” and the old King answered, “Why, O my
son, shouldst thou become like thy brother, both bereaving us
of your company?” But the other rejoined, “There is no help
for that nor will I sit at rest till I go after my lost one and espy
what hath betided him.” Thereupon his sire gave orders for
his journey and got ready what would suffice him of victual, and
he departed, but before he went he said to his youngest brother,
“Take thou this ring and set it upon thy little finger, and if it
press hard thereupon do thou understand and be certified that my
life’s blood is shed and that I have perished.” After this he
farewelled them and travelled to the place of the Enchanting Bird,
and he ceased not wayfaring for whole days and nights and
nights and days until he arrived at that stead. Then he found
the bird Philomelet and sat afar from him till about sundown
when he took station upon his cage and began to cry, “Ho thou
who sayest to the mean and mesquin, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who
sayest to the sad and severed, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who sayest to
the woeful and doleful, ‘Lodge!’” Now this cry of the Bird was
hard upon the young Prince and he had no sooner pronounced the
word “Lodge!” than the Philomelet took up somewhat of dust
beside his cage and scattered it upon him, when forthright he
became a stone lying beside his brother. Now the youngest of
the three Princes was sitting at meat with his sire when suddenly
the signet shrank till it was like to cut off his finger; so he rose
forthright to his feet and said, “There is no Majesty and there is
no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.” Quoth his
father, “What is to do with thee, O my son?” and quoth he,
“By Allah, my brother is ruined and wasted, so needs must I also
fare forth and look after the twain of them.” Exclaimed his
sire, “Why, O my son, should you three be cut off?” but the
other answered, “Needs must I do this, nor can I remain after
them without going to see what hath betided them, and either
we three shall return in safety and security or I also shall become
one of them.” So the father bade them prepare for his journey
and after they had got ready for him a sufficiency of provision
he farewelled him and the youth set out. But when he departed
from his sire the old man and his wife filleted their brows with
the fillets of sorrow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6969" id="noteref-6969" epub:type="noteref">6969</a> and they fell to weeping by night and by
day. Meanwhile the youth left not wayfaring till he reached the
stead of the Bird and the hour was mid-afternoon, when he
found his brothers ensorcelled to stones, and about sunset he sat
down at a distance from Philomelet who took station upon his
cage and began to cry, “Ho thou who sayest to the mean and
mesquin, ‘Lodge!’ Ho thou who sayest to the sad and severed,
‘Lodge!’ together with many words and instances of the same
kind.” But the Prince hardened his heart nor would speak the
word, and albeit the Bird continued his cry none was found to
answer him. Now when the sun evanished and he had kept up
his appeal in vain he went into the cage, whereupon the youngest
of the Princes arose and running up shut the door upon him.
Quoth the Bird, “Thou hast done the deed, O son of the Sultan,”
and the youth replied, “Relate to me whatso thou hast wrought
in magic to these creations of God.” Replied Philomelet,
“Beside thee lie two heaps of clay whereof one is white and the
other blue: this is used in sorcery and that to loose the spells.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I should relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Bird said to
the youngest son of the Sultan, “By the side of my cage are two
heaps of clay, this blue and that white; and the first is the material
for sorcery whilst the second looseth the spell.” Hereupon the
youth approached them and finding the mounds took somewhat of
the white and scattered it upon the stones and cried, “Be ye returned
unto your older shapes;” and, as he did so, each and every
of the stones became men as they had been. Now amongst them
were sundry sons of the Sultans, also the children of Kings and
Wazirs and Bashas and Lords of the land, and of the number two
were the elder brothers of the young Prince: so they salamed to
him and all congratulated one another on their safety. After this
one came forward to the youth and said to him, “Verily this place
is a city, all and some of whose folk are ensorcelled.” So he took
a somewhat of clay from the white and entered the streets, where,
finding the case as described to him, he fell to sifting the clay upon
them and they were transmewed from statues of stone into the
shapes of Adam’s sons. Then, at last, the sons of that city rose one
and all and began offering to the Prince gifts and rarities until he
had of them a mighty matter. But when his brothers saw that
he had become master of the bird Philomelet and his cage, and
all these presents and choice treasures, they were filled with envy
of him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6970" id="noteref-6970" epub:type="noteref">6970</a> and said each to other, “How shall our brother win him
all this and we abide with him in servile condition, especially when
we hie us homewards and return to our own land? And will not
folk say that the salvation of the two elder brothers was by the
hand of the youngest? But we cannot endure such disgrace as
this!” So envy entered them and in their jealousy they planned
and plotted the death of their cadet, who knew not that was in
their minds or whatso was hidden from him in the Limbo of
Secrets. And when they had wrought their work the youngest
Prince arose and bade his pages and eunuchs lade the loads upon
the camels and mules and, when they had done his bidding, they
all set forth on the homewards march. They travelled for whole
days and nights till they drew near their destination and the
youngest Prince bade his attendants seek an open place wherein
they might take repose, and they said, “Hearkening and obedience.”
But when they came upon it they found a well builded of stone,
and the brothers said to the cadet, “This be a place befitting rest
by reason of this well being here; for the water thereof is sweet
and good for our drink and therewith we can supply our folk and
our beasts.” Replied the youth, “This is what we desire.” So
they set up their tents hard by that well, and when the camp was
pitched they let prepare the evening meal, and as soon as it was
sun-set-tide they spread the trays and supped their sufficiency
until presently night came down upon them. Now the youngest
Prince had a bezel’d signet-ring which he had taken from the
bird Philomelet, and he was so careful thereof that he never slept
without it. But his brothers awaited until he was drowned in sleep,
when coming softly upon him they pinioned him and carried him
off and cast him into the well without anyone knowing aught
thereof. Then as soon as morning morrowed the two eldest
Princes arose and commanded the attendants to load, but these
said to them, “Where be our lord?” and said the others, “He is
sleeping in the Takhtrawán.” So the camel men arose and loaded
the loads and the litter and the two Princes sent forwards to the
King their sire a messenger of glad tidings who when he found
him informed him of the fair news. Accordingly he and all his
Lords took horse and rode forth to meet his sons upon the road
that he might salam to them and give them joy of their safe
return. Now he chanced in their train to catch sight of the caged
bird which is called “the shrilling Philomelet,” and he rejoiced
thereat and asked them, “How did ye become masters of him?”
Then he enquired anent their brother.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and

short the watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
enquired of the two elder sons concerning their younger brother
and they said, “We made ourselves masters of the Bird and we
have brought him hither and we know nothing about our cadet.”
However, the King who loved his youngest with exceeding love
put the question, “Have ye not looked after him and have ye not
been in his company?” whereto they answered saying, “A certain
wayfarer declared to have seen him on some path or other.” When
the father heard this from them he cried, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great;” and he
fell to striking palm upon palm.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6971" id="noteref-6971" epub:type="noteref">6971</a> On this wise it befel these, but
as regards the case of their brother, when they cast him into the
well he awoke from his sleep and he felt himself falling into the
depths, so he cried, “I take refuge with the All-sufficient Words of
Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6972" id="noteref-6972" epub:type="noteref">6972</a> from the mischief He hath created.” And by the blessing
of these Holy Names he reached the sole of the well without
aught of harm or hurt. Here finding himself pinioned, he strained
upon his bonds and loosed them; but the well was deep of bottom
and he came upon an arched recess, so he sat in it and exclaimed,
“Verily we are Allah’s and to Him we are returning
and I who wrought for them such work<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6973" id="noteref-6973" epub:type="noteref">6973</a> am rewarded with the
contrary thereof; withal the power is unto Allah.” And suddenly
he heard the sound of speaking at some little distance beside him,
and the voice was saying, “O Black of Head, who hath come
amongst us?” and his comrade responded, “By Allah, this youth
is the son of the Sultan and his best beloved, and the same hath
released his brothers from sorcery and was carrying them to their
homes when they played him false and cast him into this well.
However, he hath a signet-ring with a bezel which if he rub ’twill
bespeak him with whatso he desireth, and will do what he may
wish.” So the Prince said in his mind, “I bid the Servant of this
Ring to take me out;” after which he rubbed it and the Jinni
appeared and cried, “Yea verily, O son of the Sultan, what is it
thou requirest of me?”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Ringbezel
said to him, “What dost thou require of me?” and said the
Prince, “I demand that thou hoist me out of the well: and this
done that thou summon for me an host with Pages and Eunuchs
and tents and pavilions and ensigns and banners.” Whereto the
other replied, “Present!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6974" id="noteref-6974" epub:type="noteref">6974</a> Then he brought him forth the well
and the youth found hard by it all he needed, so he bade them
load their belongings upon the beasts and when this was done
he set out seeking the city of his sire. And as he drew so near
it that it was within shot of eye, he alighted there upon a broad
plain and ordered them to pitch the camp. Accordingly they set
up the tents and the sitting pavilions while the Farráshes fell to
sprinkling water upon the ground afront the abodes and to setting
up the ensigns and colours whilst the band of kettledrums went
dub-a-dub and the trumpets blared tantaras. The cooks also
began at once to prepare the evening meal. Now when the city-folk
saw this pomp and circumstance, they held in their minds that
the new comer was some Sultan approaching to take their town;
so they gathered together and went in to their own King and
informed him thereof. But he, having heard their words, felt his
heart melt and his vitals throb and a certain joy penetrate into his
heart, so he said, “Praise to the Lord, there hath entered into my
heart a certain manner of pleasure, albeit I know not what may be
the case and Allah hath said in his Holy Book, “We have heard
good news.””<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6975" id="noteref-6975" epub:type="noteref">6975</a> Hereupon he and the Lords of his land took horse
and rode till they reached the front of the pavilions where the
King dismounted from his steed. Now the Prince his younger son
was dressed in a habit that might have belonged to a hidden Hoard,
and when he saw his father he recognised him, so he rose and
met him and kissed his hands, but his sire knew him not by reason
of the case the youth was in, so he supposed him to be a strange
Sultan. Presently, the Prince asked him, “Where be thy youngest
son?” and the King hearing this fell down a-fainting, but, soon
recovering from his swoon, he said, “Verily my son hath wasted
the blood of his life and hath become food for wild beasts.” Hereupon
the youth laughed aloud and cried, “By Allah, thy son hath
not suffered aught from the shifts and changes of the World, and
he is still in the bonds of life, safe and sound; nor hath there
befallen him anything of harm whatever.” “Where is he?”
quoth the father: “He standeth between thy hands,” quoth the
son. So the Sultan looked at him and straightly considering him
found that it was his very son who was bespeaking him, and of his
delight he threw his arms around his neck and fell with him
aswoon to the ground. This lasted for a full-told hour; but when
he recovered from his fainting he asked his son what had betided
him, so he told all that had befallen, to wit how he had become
master of the Enchanting Bird Philomelet and also of the magical
clay wherewith he had besprinkled his brethren and others of
the city-folk who had been turned to stone, all and some, and how
they had returned to the shapes whilome they wore. Moreover
he recounted to him the presents and offerings which had been
made to him and also how, when they arrived at a certain place,
his brothers had pinioned him and cast him into the well. And
ere he finished speaking, lo and behold! the two other Princes
came in and when they looked upon his condition and noted the
state of prosperity he was in, surrounded as he was by all manner
of weal, they felt only increase of envy and malice. But as soon
as their sire espied them he cried, “Ye have betrayed me in my
son and have lied to me and, by Allah, there is no retribution for
you on my part save death;” and hereupon the Sultan bade do
them die. Then the youngest Prince made intercession for his
brethren and said, “O my sire, whoso doeth a deed shall meet its
deserts,” and thus he obtained their pardon. So they passed that
night one and all in camp and when morning morrowed they
loaded and returned to the city and all were in the most pleasureable
condition. Now when the King heard this tale from the
owner of the fruit it pleased him and he rejoiced therein and said,
“By Allah, O Shaykh, indeed that hath gone from us which we
had of cark and care; and in good sooth this history deserveth
that it be written with water of gold upon the pages of men’s
hearts.” Replied the other, “By Allah, O King of the Age, this
adventure is marvellous, but I have another more wondrous and
pleasurable and delectable than any thou hast yet heard.” Quoth
the Sultan, “Needs must thou repeat it to us,” and quoth the
fruit-seller, “Inshallah—God willing—I will recite it to thee on the
coming night.” Hereupon the Sultan called for a handmaiden who
was a model of beauty and loveliness and stature and perfect grace
and from the time of his buying her he never had connection with
her nor had he once slept with her, and he gave her in honourable gift
to the reciter. Then he set apart for them both an apartment with
its furniture and appurtenances and the slave-girl rejoiced greatly
thereat. Now when she went in to her new lord she donned her
best of dresses so he lay down beside her and sought carnal copulation,
but his prickle would not stand erect, as was its wont,
although he knew not the cause thereof.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the prickle of the
Fruiterer would not stand to the handmaid as was the wont
thereof, so he cried, “Verily this is a wondrous business.” Then
the girl fell to rubbing it up and to toying therewith, her object
being to stablish an erection. But the article in question grew not
and remained limp, whereupon she said, “O my lord, Allah
increase the progress of thy pego!” Thereupon she arose and
opened a bag wherefrom she drew out kerchiefs and dried
aromatic herbs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6976" id="noteref-6976" epub:type="noteref">6976</a> such as are scattered upon corpses; and she also
brought a gugglet of water. Presently she fell to washing the
prickle as it were a dead body, and after bathing it she shrouded
it with a kerchief: then she cried upon her women and they all
bewept the untimely fate of his yard which was still clothed in the
kerchief.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6977" id="noteref-6977" epub:type="noteref">6977</a> And when morning morrowed the Sultan sent after the
man and summoned him and said to him, “How passed thy
night?” So he told him all that had betided him, and concealed
from him naught; and when the Sultan heard this account from
him he laughed at him on such wise that from excess of merriment
he well nigh fell upon his back and cried, “By Allah, if there be
such cleverness in that girl, she becometh not any save myself.”
Accordingly he sent to fetch her as she stood and left the furniture
of the place wholly and entirely to the owner of the fruit. And
when this was done the Sultan made of him a boon-companion
for that day from morning to evening and whenever he thought of
the handmaid’s doings he ordered the man to repeat the tale and
he laughed at him and admired the action of the slave-girl with
the Limpo. When darkness came on they prayed the night-prayer
and they supped and sat down to converse and to tell
anecdotes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6978" id="noteref-6978" epub:type="noteref">6978</a> Thereupon the King said to the Fruiterer, “Relate us
somewhat of that thou hast heard anent the Kings of old;” and
said the other, “Hearing and obeying,” and forthwith began the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>STORY OF THE KING OF AL-YAMAN AND HIS THREE SONS.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">It is related that there was a Sultan in the land of Al-Yaman who
had three male children, two of them by one mother and a third by
another. Now that King used to dislike this second wife and her
son, so he sent her from him and made her, together with her child,
consort with the handmaids of the kitchen, never asking after them
for a while of time. One day the two brothers-german went in to
their sire and said to him, “’Tis the desire of us to go forth a-hunting
and a-chasing,” whereto their father replied, “And have ye force
enough for such sport?” They said, “Yea, verily, we have!”
when he gave to each of them a horse with its furniture of saddle
and bridle, and the twain rode off together. But as soon as the
third son (who together with his mother had been banished to the
kitchen) heard that the other two had gone forth to hunt, he went to
his mother and cried, “I also would fain mount and away to the
chase like my brethren.” His mother responded, saying, “O my
son, indeed I am unable to buy thee a horse or aught of the kind;”
so he wept before her and she brought him a silvern article, which
he took and fared forth with it to the bazar, and there, having sold
it for a gold piece, he repaired to a neighbouring mill and bought
him a lame garron. After this he took a bittock of bread; and,
backing the beast without saddle or bridle, he followed upon the
footsteps of his brothers through the first day and the second, but
on the third he took the opposite route. Presently he reached
a Wady, when behold, he came across a string<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6979" id="noteref-6979" epub:type="noteref">6979</a> of pearls and
emeralds which glittered in the sunlight, so he picked it up and set
it upon his head and he fared onwards singing for very joy. But
when he drew near the town he was met by his two brothers who
seized him and beat him and, having taken away his necklace, drove
him afar from them. Now he was much stronger and more beautiful
than they were, but as he and his mother had been cast off by
the King, he durst not offer aught of resistance.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6980" id="noteref-6980" epub:type="noteref">6980</a> Now the two
brothers having taken the necklace from him went away joyful, and
repairing to their father, showed him the ornament and he rejoiced
in them and hending it in his hand marvelled thereat. But the
youngest son went to his mother with his heart well nigh broken.
Then the Sultan said to his two sons, “Ye have shown no cleverness
herein until ye bring me the wearer of this necklace.” They
answered, “Hearkening and obedience, and we will set out to find
her.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable?” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I should relate to you on the coming night an the
King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and

    <div>The Four Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the sons of the Sultan
made them ready for the march whereby they might bring back
the bird to whom the necklace belonged. So they took them a
sufficiency of provision and, farewelling their father, set out for the
city wherein they judged the bird might be. Such was their case;
but as regards their unhappy brother, when he heard the news of
their going he took with him a bittock of bread and having bidden
adieu to his mother mounted his lame garron and followed upon
the traces of his brethren for three days. Presently he found himself
in the midst of the wild and the wold, and he ceased not faring
therethrough till he came to a city whose folk were all weeping and
wailing and crying and keening. So he accosted an aged man and
said to him, “The Peace be upon thee!” and when the other
returned his salam and welcomed him he asked saying, “O my
uncle, tell me what causeth these groans and this grief?” The
other replied, “O my son, verily our city is domineered over by
a monstrous Lion who every year cometh about this time and he
hath already done on such wise for forty and three years.” Now
he expecteth every twelvemonth as he appeareth to be provided
with a damsel arrayed and adorned in all her finery, and if he
chance to come as is his wont and find her not he would assault the
city and destroy it. So before the season of his visit they cast
lots upon the maidens of the place and whomso these befal, her they
decorate and lead forth to a place without the walls that the
monster may take her. And this year the sort hath fallen upon
the King’s daughter.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6981" id="noteref-6981" epub:type="noteref">6981</a> When the youth heard these words he held
his peace and, having taken seat by the old man for an hour or so,
he arose and went forth to the place where the Lion was wont to
appear and he took his station there, when behold, the daughter of
the King came to him and right heavy was she of heart. But
as she found the youth sitting there, she salam’d to him and
made friendship with him and asked, “What brought thee to this
stead?” Answered he, “That which brought <em>thee</em> brought me
also.” Whereto quoth she, “Verily at this hour the Lion shall
come to seize me, but as soon as he shall see me he will devour
thee before me, and thus both of us shall lose our lives; so
rise up and depart and save thyself, otherwise thou wilt become
mere wasted matter in the belly of the beast.” “By Allah, O my
lady,” quoth he, “I am thy sacrifice at such a moment as this!”
And as they were speaking, suddenly the world was turned topsy-turvy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6982" id="noteref-6982" epub:type="noteref">6982</a>
and dust-clouds and sand-devils<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6983" id="noteref-6983" epub:type="noteref">6983</a> flew around and whirlwinds
began to play about them, and lo and behold! the monster made
his appearance; and as he approached he was lashing his flanks
with his tail like the sound of a kettle-drum. Now when the
Princess espied him, the tears poured down her cheeks, whereat
the youth sprang to his feet in haste, and unsheathing his sword,
went forth to meet the foe, who at the sight of him gnashed his
tusks at him. But the King’s son met him bravely, springing
nimbly from right to left, whereat the Lion raged furiously, and
with the design to tear him limb from limb, made a rush at the
youth, who smote him with all the force of his forearm and
planted between his eyes a sway of scymitar so sore that the blade
came out flashing between his thighs, and he fell to the ground
slain and bleeding amain. When the Princess saw this derring-do
of her defender, she rejoiced greatly and fell to wiping with her
kerchief the sweat from his brow; and the youth said to her,
“Arise and do thou fare to thy family.” “O my lord, and O light
of mine eyes!” said she, “we twain together will wend together as
though we were one flesh;” but he rejoined, “This is on no wise
possible.” Then he arose from beside her and ceased not faring
until he had entered the city, where he rested himself beside a
shop. She also sprang up, and faring homewards, went in to her
father and mother, showing signs of sore sorrow. When they saw
her, their hearts fluttered with fear lest the monster should attack
the town and destroy it, whereupon she said to them, “By Allah,
the Lion hath been slain and lieth there dead.” They asked her
saying, “What was it  killed him?” and she answered, “A handsome
youth fair of favour,” but they hardly believed her words and
both went to visit the place, where they found the monster stonedead.
The folk of the city, one and all, presently heard this fair
news, and their joy grew great, when the Sultan said to his
daughter, “Thou! knowest thou the man who slew him?” to which
she answered, “I know him.” But as all tidings of the youth were
cut off, the King let proclaim about the city——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying

proclaim through the city how none should oppose him or delay

should come forth and pass before the windows of his daughter’s
palace. Accordingly the Crier went abroad and cried about the city
to that purport, bidding all the lieges muster and defile in front
of the Princess’s windows; and they continued so doing for three
full-told days, while she sat continually expecting to sight the
youth who had slain the Lion, but to no purpose. At last never a
soul remained who had not passed in the review, so the Sultan
asked, “Is there anyone who hath absented himself?” and they
answered, “There is none save a stranger youth who dwelleth in
such and such a place.” “Bring him hither!” cried the King,
“and command him to pass muster,” when the others hastened
to fetch him; and as soon as he drew near to the window, behold,
a kerchief was thrown upon him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6984" id="noteref-6984" epub:type="noteref">6984</a> Then the Sultan summoned
him, and he, when standing in the presence, saluted and made
obeisance and blessed the Sovran with the blessings fit for the
Caliphs. The Sultan was pleased thereat and said, “Art thou he
who slew the Lion?” and said the other, “I did.” Hereupon
quoth the King, “Ask a favour of me, that I grant it to thee;”
and quoth the Youth, “I pray of Allah and then of our lord the
Sultan that he marry me to his daughter.” But the King continued,
“Ask of me somewhat of wealth,” and all the Lords of the
land exclaimed, “By Allah, he deserveth the Princess who saved
her from the Lion and slew the beast.” Accordingly the King
bade the marriage-knot be tied, and let the bridegroom be led in
procession to the bride, who rejoiced in him with extreme joy, and
he abated her maidenhead and the two lay that night together.
But the Prince arose about the latter hours without awaking his
bride, and withdrawing her seal-ring from her finger passed his
own thereupon and wrote in the palm of her hand, “I am
’Aláeddín,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6985" id="noteref-6985" epub:type="noteref">6985</a> son of King Such-and-such, who ruleth in the capital
of Al-Hind, and, given thou love me truly, do thou come to me,
otherwise stay in thy father’s house.” Then he went forth without
awaking her and fared through wilds and wolds for a term of ten
days, travelling by light and by night, till he drew near a certain
city which was domineered over by an Elephant. Now this beast
would come every year and take from the town a damsel; and on
this occasion it was the turn of the Princess, daughter to the King
who governed that country. But as the youth entered the streets
he was met by groans and moans and crying and keening; so he
asked thereanent and was answered that the Elephant was presently
approaching to seize the maiden and devour her.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6986" id="noteref-6986" epub:type="noteref">6986</a> He
asked, “To what stead cometh he?” and they pointed out to him
a place without the city whereto he repaired and took his seat.
Suddenly the Princess presented herself before him a-weeping
and with tears down her cheeks a-creeping, when he said to her,
“O my lady, there is no harm for thee.” Said she, “O youth,
by Allah! thou wastest thy life to no purpose and seekest thy
death without cause, so rise up and save thyself, for the Elephant
will be here this very hour.” And behold, the beast came up to
the heart of the waste and he was raising a dust-cloud and
trumpeting with rage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6987" id="noteref-6987" epub:type="noteref">6987</a> and lashing flanks with tail. But when he
arrived at the wonted place he was confronted by the youth
who, with heart stronger than granite, hastened to fall upon him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6988" id="noteref-6988" epub:type="noteref">6988</a>
and fatigued him and dealt blows without cease; and, when the
Elephant charged down upon him, he met the monster with a stroke
between the eyes dealt with all the force of his forearm, and the
blade came flashing out from between the thighs, when the beast
fell to the ground slain and weltering in his blood amain. Thereupon,
in the stress of her joy, the Princess arose hurriedly and
walked towards the youth——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I should relate to you
on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Thirtieth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Princess
walked hurriedly towards the youth and in the stress of her joy
she threw her arms around his neck and kissed him between the
eyes and cried, “O my lord, may thy hands never palsied grow
nor exult over thee any foe!” Said he to her, “Return to thy
people!” and said she, “There is no help but that I and thou
fare together.” But he replied, “This matter is not the right
rede,” and he went from her at a double quick pace, saying, “O
Allah, may none see me!” until he entered the city and presently
seating him beside a tailor’s shop fell to conversing with its owner.
Presently the man said, “There is no Majesty and there is no
Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great: by this time the
daughter of the King will have been seized by the Elephant and
torn to pieces and devoured, and she the mainstay of her mother
and her father.” And behold loud lullilooing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6989" id="noteref-6989" epub:type="noteref">6989</a> flew about the
city and one began exclaiming “Verily the Elephant which is
wont to come hither year by year hath been slaughtered by a
man quite young in years, and the Sultan hath sent a Crier to
cry amongst the crowds, ‘Let the slayer of the beast come into
the presence and crave a boon and marry the maiden.’” So
quoth the Youth to the tailor, “What is to do?” and the other
informed him of the truth of the report, whereupon he asked, “If
I go to the King will he give her to me?” Answered the tailor,
“Who art thou that thou shouldst intermarry with the daughter
of the King?” and the Prince rejoined, “We will go and bespeak
him and lie to him saying, I am he who slew the monster.”
But the other retorted, “O Youth, thou art willingly and wilfully
going to thy death, for an thou lie to him he will assuredly cut off
thy head.” Presently the Prince, who was listening to the Crier,
said to his companion, “Up with thee and come with us that
thou mayest look upon my execution;” and cried the other,
“Why so, O thou true-born son?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6990" id="noteref-6990" epub:type="noteref">6990</a> whereto the Youth replied,
“Needs must I do this!” Hereupon he and the man arose and
went till they came to the palace of the Sultan, where they craved
leave to enter, but were forbidden by the Chamberlain, when lo and
behold! the Princess looked out from the lattice and saw the Prince
together with the tailor. So she threw the kerchief upon his head
and cried aloud, “By Allah, here he be, and ’tis none but he who
slew the Elephant and who saved me from him.” Hereat the
tailor fell to wondering at the youth, but when the King saw
that his daughter had thrown the kerchief upon him, he presently
sent to summon him between his hands and asked him how it
happened, and heard from him the truth of the tale. Then said
he, “By Allah, verily my daughter was lost, so that this youth
well deserveth her.” Thereupon he tied the marriage tie between
the twain and the youth after wedding her went to her in procession
and did away her pucelage, and lay the night with her.
And presently when day was nigh, the young Prince arose and
seeing her slumbering wrote in the palm of her hand, “I am Such-and-such,
the son of such a King in Such-and-such a capital; and
if thou love me truly, come to find me, or otherwise stay in thy
father’s house.” Then without awaking her he fared forth to the
city of the Enchanting Bird and ceased not cutting athwart the
wilds and the wolds throughout the nights and the days till he
arrived at the place wherein dwelt the Bird Philomelet whereto the
necklace belonged. And she was the property of the Princess the
daughter to the Sovran whose seat was in that capital, and it was
the greatest of cities and its King was the grandest of the Kings.
When he entered the highways he leant against the shop of an
Oilman to whom he said, “The Peace be upon you,” and the other
returned his salutation and seated him beside himself, and the two
fell to conversing. Presently the Prince asked him, “O my lord,
what canst thou tell me concerning a certain Bird and her owner?”
and the other made answer, “I know nothing but of oil and of
honey and of clarified butter, whereof whatever thou requirest I
will give to thee.” Quoth the youth, “This is no reply to my
question,” and quoth the oilman, “I know not nor regard aught
save what is by me in my shop.” So the Prince rising from
beside him left him and went forth to continue his search; but
whenever he asked concerning the Bird and its owner, the folk
changed the subject and returned him no reply save, “We know
not.” This lasted until he accosted a man well stricken in years,
whose age was nigh to an hundred; and he was sitting alone
at one side of the city; so the Youth walked up to him and
salam’d; and, after the other returned his greeting and kindly
welcomed him and seated him near him, the two fell a-talking
together, and the Prince asked him, “O my uncle, what canst
thou tell me concerning the Bird whose necklet is of precious
stones, and what concerning the owner thereof?” The aged man
held his peace for awhile and presently exclaimed, “O my son,
why ask me of this? O my child,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6991" id="noteref-6991" epub:type="noteref">6991</a> verily the Kings and sons of
the Kings have sought her in marriage but could not avail;
and indeed the lives of folks manifold have been wasted upon her.
How, then, canst thou hope to win her? Nevertheless, O
my son, go and buy thee seven lambs and slaughter them and
skin them, after which do thou roast them and cut them all in
halves; for she hath seven doors at each whereof standeth as
warder a rending Lion; and at the eighth which guardeth the
maiden and the Bird are posted forty slaves who at all times
are there lying. And now I leave thee to thy luck, O my son.”
But when the Prince heard these words he asked his aidance of
the Shaykh and went forth from him——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

    <div>The Four Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
craved for the prayers of the Shaykh, who blessed him. Then he
went forth from him and bought of the lambs what he had been
charged to buy, and these he slaughtered and skinned and roasted
and he cut each and every into two halves. He waited until night
descended with its darkness and ceased the to-ing and fro-ing of
folk, when he arose and walked to the place pointed out and
there he found the Lion whose shape and size equalled the stature
of a full-grown bull. He threw to him half a lamb and the
beast allowed him to pass through that door, and it was the same
with the other entrances, all seven of them, until he reached the
eighth. Here he found the forty slaves who were bestrewn on the
ground bedrowned in sleep; so he went in with soft tread and
presently he came upon the Bird Philomelet in a cage encrusted
with pearls and precious stones and he saw the Princess who owned
him lying asleep upon a couch. Hereat he wrote upon the palm
of her hand, “I am Such-and-such, son to the King Such-and-such,
of such a city; and I have come in upon thee and beheld thee
bared whilst thou wast sleeping, and I have also taken away the
Bird. However, an thou love me and long for me, do thou come to
me in mine own city.” Then he seized the Bird to his prize and
fared forth and what he did with the Lions coming that he did
when going out. The Veiler<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6992" id="noteref-6992" epub:type="noteref">6992</a> veiled him, and he went forth the
city and met not a single soul, and he ceased not faring the live-long
night till next morning did appear, when he hid in a place seeking
repose and he ate somewhat of victual. But as soon as the daylight
shone bright, he arose and continued his journey, praying Allah
for protection on his wayfare, till it was mid-afternoon: then he
found, like an oasis in the middle of the waste, certain pastures of
the wild Arabs and as he drew near the owner met him and
salam’d to him and greeted him and blessed him. So he lay
that night with them till dawn when the Shaykh of the encampment
who had heard of the stranger came to him and welcomed
him and found him a youth fair of form and favour and saw by
his side the Enchanting Bird in its cage. He recognised it and
wondered at the young man’s derring-do and cried, “Subhana ’llah—praise
be to God—who hath committed His secret unto the
weakliest of His creation!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6993" id="noteref-6993" epub:type="noteref">6993</a> Verily this Bird hath caused on its
account to be slain many of the Wazirs and the Kings and the
Sultans, yet hath yonder lad mastered it and carried it away.
This however is by virtue of his good fortune.” Then the old
man had compassion on him and gave him a horse that he had
by him together with somewhat of provaunt. The Prince took
them from him and returning to his march traversed the wilds and
the wolds for days and nights, all of them; and he continued in that
case when he drew near his father’s capital which rose within
eye-shot. And as he walked on without heed, behold, his brethren
met him and confronted him and fell upon him and, having taken
away the Enchanting Bird, reviled him and beat him and shook
him off and drove him away. Then they entered the city and
sought their sire who received them with fair reception and greeted
them and rejoiced in them; after which they presented him with
the Bird Philomelet, and said, “Here we bring him to thee and
there befel us through his account much toil and trouble.” But
their brother who had really won the prize went to his mother in
sadness of heart——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I should relate to you on the

was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the young
Prince who had brought the Bird and whom his brothers had
beaten and robbed of his prize, went to his mother in sadness of
heart and shedding tears. Quoth she, “What is thy case and
what hath befallen thee?” So he told her what had betided him
and she said, “Sorrow not, O my son; the course of the right
shall be made manifest.” Then she quieted him and soothed his
heart. This is what happened to these persons; but as regards
the Princess, the owner of the Bird, when she awoke at dawn of
day and opened her eyes, she found her favourite gone and as
her glance fell upon the things about her, suddenly she saw something
written in the palm of her hand. But as soon as she had
read it and comprehended its purport, she cried aloud with a mighty
grievous cry which caused the palace-women to flock around,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6994" id="noteref-6994" epub:type="noteref">6994</a>
and her father to ask what was to do but none could explain it
because no one knew. So the Sultan arose forthright and, going
in to his daughter, found her buffeting her face for the sake of
her Bird and asked her, “What is to do with thee?” So she
informed him of what had befallen her, adding, “Verily he who
came into my bower and discovered me bare and looked upon
me and wrote upon the palm of my hand, him I am determined
to have and none other save that one.” Quoth her father,
“O my daughter, many sons of the Wazirs and the Kings have
sought the Bird and have failed; and now do thou suppose that
he hath died;” but quoth the Princess, “I desire none save the
man who found me in sleep and looked upon me, and he is the
son of King So-and-so, reigning in a such a capital.” Said her
father, “Then how standeth the case?” and said she, “Needs
must I thank him and seek his city and marry him, for assuredly
amongst the sons of the Kings, all of them, none can be fairer or
more delightsome than he who hath craftily devised this entrance
to me in so guarded a stead as this. How then can anyone be
his peer?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6995" id="noteref-6995" epub:type="noteref">6995</a> Hereupon her father bade muster the forces without
the city and he brought out for his daughter rarities and presents
and mule-litters, and they pitched the tents and after three days
they loaded the loads for travel. Then they fared for whole days
and nights until they drew near the city wherein the youth had
slain the Elephant and had saved the daughter of the King. So
the Sultan set up his encampment with its tents and pavilions
hard by the walls, to the end that all might take their rest, but
when the King of the City saw this he rode forth to visit the
stranger, and after greeting asked him the cause of his coming
with such a host. The Sultan apprised him of what had happened
to his daughter, how she had lost the Enchanting Bird, also how
the youth had come into her bower and had written a writ upon
the palm of her hand. But when the King heard from him this
account he knew and was certified that it was the same Prince who
had also slain the Elephant and who had on such wise saved his
daughter’s life; so he said to the Sultan, “Verily he who
took the Bird belonging to thy Princess hath also married my
daughter, for he hath done such-and-such deeds.” After which
he related to him the slaughter of the Elephant and all that had
happened from beginning to end. Now as soon as the Sultan heard
these words he cried, “By Allah my daughter is excusable and
she hath shown her insight and her contrivance;” and presently
he arose and going in to her related what he had heard from the
King of the City, and she wondered at the tale of the youth’s
adventures and the killing of the Elephant. They nighted in that
stead and the tidings soon reached the ears of the youth’s wife,
the Princess who had been saved from the Elephant, and she said
to her sire, “I also needs must go to him and forgather with
him.” Hereupon the King her father bade muster his troops
together with the Lords of the land without the city beside the
host of the chief Sultan, and on the second day both Sovrans
bade the loads be loaded for the march. When their bidding
was obeyed the twain set out together and travelled for days and
nights until they drew near to the capital of the King where the
youth had slain the Lion, and they pitched their tents in its
neighbourhood. Presently the Sovran of that capital came out
and greeted them and asked them the cause of their coming; so
they informed him of their adventures from commencement to
conclusion; and he, when certified of the truth of this tale,
returned to inform his daughter thereof.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the third King
informed his daughter of the certainty of the tidings, and she
also exclaimed, “Needs must I as well as they set out to seek
him and forgather with him.” So her father returned to the
Sultan and the King and told them of the adventures of the youth,
and how he was the cause of his daughter’s salvation from the
Lion which he had slain; and when the twain heard his words
they marvelled and cried, “By Allah, verily this youth is fortunate
in all his doings: would Heaven we knew how be his condition
with his father and whether he is loved or he is loathed.” Then
the three fell to talking of the Prince’s qualities, and presently the
third King arose and gave orders for gathering together the Lords
of his land and his army, and he brought out for his daughter
mule-litters, and gat ready all she might require of rarities and
offerings. Then the three Kings gave orders to load the beasts
and fared together, taking with them their three daughters who,
whenever they conversed together used to praise the high gifts of
the Prince, and she who was the mistress of the Bird would say
“Ye twain have forgathered with him;” and the others would
answer, “We passed with him no more than a single night;”
after which they would relate to her the slaughter of the Lion
and the Elephant. So she wondered and cried, “By Allah! verily
he is auspicious of fortune.” And they ceased not to be in such
case for whole days and nights, and nights and days, throughout
the length of the journey till they drew near the far-famed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6996" id="noteref-6996" epub:type="noteref">6996</a> city
which was the bourne of their wayfare and the object of their
wishes. Now this happened about sunset-tide, so the three Kings
who had alighted together bade their tents and pavilions be set
up, and when their behest was obeyed, each and every of the
three commanded that the firemen and the linkmen light up their
torches and cressets, and they did so, one and all, until that Wady
was illumined as by the sheen of day. But when the city folk saw
what was done by the three Kings, their hearts quaked and their
flesh quivered, and they cried, “Verily for the mighty hosts of
these Kings there needs must be a cause of coming.” However
the strangers nighted in site until morn grew light, when the three
Sovrans forgathered, and sent a messenger with an invite to the
Lord of the city, who on receiving him, exclaimed, “Hearkening
and obedience!” Then mounting without stay or delay he rode
forth till he reached the strangers’ camp, where he alighted and
went in and greeted them; and they, on similar guise, arose to him
and wished him long life, and seated him and fell to conversing
with him for a full-told hour. But he was whelmed in the ocean
of thought, and he kept saying to himself, “Would Heaven I
knew what be the cause of the Kings coming to this my country.”
However, the four Sovrans continued to converse until the noontide
hour, when the trays were dispread for them, and the tables
were laid with sumptuous meats in platters and chargers of precious
metal, the very basins and ewers being of virgin gold. But when
the King of that city beheld this he marvelled, and said in his
mind, “By Allah, there is not with me aught of rarities like these.”
As soon as they had ended eating what sufficed them, water was
brought to them and they washed their hands, after which they
were served with confections and coffee and sherbets. Anon
the three Kings said to their guest, “Thou, hast thou any
children?” and said he, “Yes, I have two sons.” Quoth they,
“Summon them before us that we may look upon them;” so he
sent and bade them make act of presence. The Princes donned
their finest dresses and perfumed themselves; then they took
horse and rode until they had reached their father’s palace. But
the three Princesses stood to look at them, and she who was
owner of the Bird Philomelet asked of the two others, saying,
“Is he amongst these twain?” and they answered, “Nay, he is
not.” She exclaimed, “By Allah, both of them be fine men,”
and the others cried, “Indeed, our husband is far fairer and finer
than they.” But when the Kings saw the two brothers they said
to their sire, “Verily our need is not with them.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the two
Kings said to the lord of the city, “Verily our need is not in this
pair of youths,” and the third King added, “By Allah, indeed
these two young men be fair of favour,” for that he had not
seen the Prince who had taken his daughter’s Bird Philomelet.
Presently the two asked the father saying, “Thou, is there by
thee no issue other than these two?” and said he, “Yes, I have
a son, but I have cast him out and I have placed his mother
amongst the handmaids of the kitchen.” “Send to fetch him,”
quoth they; so he despatched a messenger to bring him into the
presence. And he came, withal he was without any finery of
dress; but as soon as the two damsels saw him they communed
concerning him and he inclined to them and went into their
pavilion, when they rose to him and threw their arms round his
neck and kissed him between his eyes. Hereupon the mistress of
the Bird said to the two others, “Be this he?” and said they,
“Yes;” so she also arose and kissed his hand. But when he had
finished greeting them he at once went forth to the assembled
Kings, who stood up in honour to him and welcomed him and
greeted him; and when his father saw that case he wondered
with great wonderment. Then the youth took seat afar from his
brothers and addressed them, saying, “Which of the twain was
first to take the necklace?” And they held their peace. He
resumed speech and said to them, “Which of you killed the Lion
and which of you slew the Elephant and which of you embraved
his heart and going into the bower of the august damsel, daughter
to this Sultan, carried off her Bird Philomelet?” But they
answered him never a syllable and were far from offering a reply.
So he resumed, “Wherefore did you fall upon me and beat me
and take away the Enchanting Bird, when I was able to slay you
both? Yet to everything is its own time and this my father had
banished me and banished my mother nor did he give her aught
of what became her.” Saying these words the youth fell upon his
two brethren with his sword and striking a single stroke he slew the
twain, after which he would have assaulted his sire, and put him
to death. However the three Kings forbade him and presently he
whose daughter owned the Bird put an end to this by insisting
upon the marriage-tie with him being tied. So he went in unto
her that very night and the three damsels became his acknowledged
spouses. After this his father gave command that his mother be
admitted into the Palace and he honoured her and banished the
parent of his two elder sons for he was assured that their cadet
had done such derring-do by slaying the Lion and the Elephant
and by bringing into the presence Philomelet the Enchanting
Bird and he was certified that the deed had been done by none
other. So he set apart a palace for the young Prince and his three
Princesses and he gave him a commandment and their joys ever
increased. And lastly the three Kings ceased not abiding in that
place for forty days after which they devised their departure.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the three
Kings desired, one and all of them, to depart and return to their
countries and their capitals; and their son-in-law presented them
with gifts and rarities, whereupon they blessed him and went their
ways. After this the young Prince, who had become Sovran and
Sultan, took seat upon the throne of his realm and by the reign he
was obeyed and the servants of Allah for him prayed. Presently
on a day of the days he inclined to the hunt and the chase, so he
went off with his suite till they found themselves in the middle of the
wildest of wolds where the ruler came upon an underground cavern.
He proposed to enter therein, when his followers prevented him
and behold, a man came to him from the desert showing the signs
of wayfare and carrying a somewhat of water and victual and his
garments were all threadbare. The King enquired of him saying,
“Whence hast thou come and whither art thou going?” and the
other replied, “We be three in this antre who have fled our
country; and whenever we require aught of meat and drink, one
of us fareth forth to fetch what will suffice us of provision for ten
days.” “And what is the cause of your flying your native land?”
asked the King, and the other answered, “Verily our tale is
wondrous and our adventures are joyous and marvellous.” Hereupon
quoth the King, “Walláhi, we will not quit this spot till
such time as we shall have heard your histories; and let each one
of you three recount to us what befel him, so that we hear it from
his own mouth.” Hereupon the King commanded sundry of his
suite to set forth home and the rest to abide beside him; and he
sent a Chamberlain of the Chamberlains that he might go bring
from the city somewhat of victual and water and wax candles and
all the case required, saying the while to himself, “Verily the
hearing of histories is better than hunting and birding, for haply
they may solace and gladden the hearts of men.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6997" id="noteref-6997" epub:type="noteref">6997</a> So the
Chamberlain went forth and, after an absence of an hour or so
he returned bringing all the King had commanded; upon which
he and the suite brought in the Larrikin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6998" id="noteref-6998" epub:type="noteref">6998</a> together with his two
companions until they led them to the presence and seated the
three together. All this while none of the vagabonds knew that
the personage before them was the King of the city. So they fell
to conversing until the next night came on when the Sovran bade
them tell their tales of themselves and what had befallen each
and every of them. They replied, “Hearkening and obedience;”
and the foremost of them began to recite the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>HISTORY OF THE FIRST LARRIKIN.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">Verily, O King, my tale is a rare and it is e’en as follows:—I
had a mother of whose flocks the World had left her but a single
kid, and we owned ne’er another. Presently we determined to
sell it; and, having so done, we bought with its price a young
calf, which we brought up for a whole year till it grew fat and
full-sized. Then my mother said to me, “Take yon calf and go
sell it;” so I went forth with it to the Bazar, and I saw that
not one was like it, when behold, a body of vagabonds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6999" id="noteref-6999" epub:type="noteref">6999</a> who
numbered some forty, looked at the beast, and it pleased them;
so they said one to other, “Let us carry this away and cut its
throat and flay it.” Then one of them, as all were standing afar
off, came near me and said, “O youth, wilt thou sell this kid?”
and quoth I, “O my uncle, verily this is a calf and not a kid;” and
the other rejoined, “Art thou blind? This is a kid.” Cried I,
“A calf!” So he asked, “Wilt thou take from me a dollar?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7000" id="noteref-7000" epub:type="noteref">7000</a>
and I answered, “Nay, O my uncle!” Thereupon he went away
from me, and another came after him and said, “O youth, wilt
thou sell this kid?” and said I, “This is a calf,” and quoth he
“This is a kid,” and reviled me the while I held my peace.
Again quoth he, “Wilt thou take for this a dollar?” but I was
not satisfied therewith, and they ceased not to wrangle with me,
one after other, each coming up and saying, “O youth, wilt thou
sell this kid?” At last their Shaykh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7001" id="noteref-7001" epub:type="noteref">7001</a> accosted me and cried,
“Wilt thou sell it?” and I rejoined, “There is no Majesty save in
Allah! I will sell it on one condition, to wit, that I take from
thee its tail.” Replied to me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7002" id="noteref-7002" epub:type="noteref">7002</a> the Shaykh of the Vagabonds,
“Thou shalt take the tail when we have slaughtered it;” then,
paying me a dollar, he led off the beast, and returned to his own
folk. Presently they killed it and flayed it, when I took the tail
and hastened back to my mother. She said to me, “Hast thou
sold the calf?” and said I, “Yes, I have sold it, and have taken a
dollar and the calf’s tail.” “And what wilt thou do for the tail?”
asked she; and I answered, “I will do him brown<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7003" id="noteref-7003" epub:type="noteref">7003</a> who took it
from me saying, This is a kid, and I will serve him a sleight which
shall get out of him to its price ten times one hundred.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7004" id="noteref-7004" epub:type="noteref">7004</a> With
these words I arose and, taking the tail, I flayed it and studded it
with nails and bits of glass, and I asked of my mother a maiden’s
dress, which she brought me; and presently I covered my face
with a Burka’-veil,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7005" id="noteref-7005" epub:type="noteref">7005</a> and I adorned me and perfumed myself and I
girded my loins underneath my clothes with the tail of that calf.
Then went I forth like a virgin girl till I reached the barrack of
those blackguards, when I found that they had cooked the whole
calf and naught of it remained undressed, and they had prepared
to spread the table and were about sitting down to supper.
Then I went<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7006" id="noteref-7006" epub:type="noteref">7006</a> in to them and said, “The Peace be upon you,”
and they rose to me in a body of their joy, and returned my
greetings and said, “By Allah, our night is a white one.” So I
entered to them and supped with them, and they all inclined to
me, and their moustachios wagged in token that they would disport
with me. But when darkness came on they said, “This
night is for our Shaykh, but after this each one of us shall take
her for his own night.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable?” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I should relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Forty-first Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the vagabonds
said, “Each one of us shall take her to him for a night after the
Shaykh,” and so saying they left me and went their ways. Then
the Chief fell to chatting with me and he was in high spirits, when
suddenly my glance fell upon a rope hanging from the ceiling of
that barrack and I cried, “O Shaykh!” whereto he replied, “Yes,
O my lady and light of mine eyes.” Said I to him, “What
may be this cord thus suspended?” and said he, “This is called
‘hanging-gear’; and, when any of ours requireth chastisement
from my associates, we hoist him up by this rope and we bash
him.” Quoth I, “Hang me up and let me see how ’tis done,” but
quoth he, “Heaven forfend, O my lady! I will hang myself in thy
stead and thou shalt look upon me.” Hereat he arose and tied
himself tight and cried, “Haul up this rope and make it fast in
such a place!” I did his bidding and bound it right firmly and
left him hanging in the air. Presently he cried “Let go the cord,”
and replied I, “O Shaykh, first let me enjoy the spectacle.” Then
I stripped him of all his clothing and drawing forth the calf’s tail
which was studded with nails and glass splinters, I said to him,
“O Shaykh, is this the tail of a kid or of a calf?” “What woman
art thou?” asked he, and I answered, “I am the owner of the
calf;” and then, tucking up my two sleeves to the elbows, I beat
him till I stripped him of his skin and he lost his senses and he
had no breath wherewith to speak. Thereupon I arose and fell to
searching the hall, where I found sundry valuables amongst which
was a box, so I opened it and came upon three hundred gold
pieces and a store of reals<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7007" id="noteref-7007" epub:type="noteref">7007</a> and silverlings and jadids.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7008" id="noteref-7008" epub:type="noteref">7008</a> I laid
hands on the whole of it and then bore off somewhat of the
most sumptuous dresses; and, having wrapped them all up in a
sheet, I carried them away; and about dawn I went in to my
mother and cried, “Take these to the price of the calf, which
I have received from the purchaser.” But when the day was high
and the sun waxed hot the whole troop of the Shaykh collected
and said, “Verily our Elder hath slept till the undurn hour;” and
one of them declared “’Tis from enjoying so much pleasure
and luxury, he and the girl; and doubtless their night hath been
a white<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7009" id="noteref-7009" epub:type="noteref">7009</a> night.” So they ceased not talking together and each of
them had his word until the noon was nigh, when certain of them
said, “Come with us and let us rouse him from sleep:” and,
saying thus, all went to the door of the hall and opened it. Hereupon
they found their Shaykh hanging up and his body bleeding
profusely;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7010" id="noteref-7010" epub:type="noteref">7010</a> so they asked him, “What hath befallen thee?” and
he answered in a weak voice, “Verily that girl is no girl at all, but
she is the youth who owned the calf.” They replied, “By Allah,
there is no help but that we seize him and slay him;” whereto the
Elder said, “Loose me and lead me to the Hammam that I may
wash clean my skin of all this blood.” Then they let him down
and after mounting him upon a donkey they bore him to the baths.
Hereat I went to the slaughter-house and covered my body with
bullocks’ blood and stuck to it pledgets of cotton so that I became
like one sorely diseased and I repaired to the same Hammam
propped upon a staff and required admittance. They refused me
saying, “The Shaykh of the Vagabonds is now in the baths nor
may anyone go in to him.” Quoth I to them, “I am a man with a
malady,” whereto quoth one of them, “This is a poor wight, so let
him come within.” Accordingly I entered and found the Chief
alone, whereupon I drew forth the tail and asked him, “O Shaykh, is
this the tail of a calf or a kid?” “Who art thou,” said he, and I
said, “I am the owner of the calf;” after which I fell to beating
him with the tail until his breath was clean gone. Then I left him
and went forth from the Hammam by another door so as to avoid his
followers.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where
is this compared with that I should relate to you on the coming
night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was

    <div>The Four Hundred and Forty-second Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth, the
owner of the calf, after beating the Shaykh of the Vagabonds with
a sore bashing within the Bath went forth by the back door.
Whereupon (continued the Larrikin) the followers of the Chief
went in and they found him at his last breath and moaning from
the excess of blows. Quoth they, “What is the matter with
thee?” and quoth he, “That man with a malady who came into
the Hammam is none other but the owner of the calf and he hath
killed me.” So they took him up and carried him from the place
and he said to them, “Do ye bear me outside the city and set up for
me a tent and lay me therein, after which do ye gather round about
me and never leave me at all.” Hereat they mounted him upon
an ass and bore him to the place he described and, pitching a tent,
set him therein and all sat around him. Presently the tidings reached
me, whereupon I changed my clothes for a disguise and drew near
the tent whereabouts I found a Badawi-man feeding his sheep. So
I said to him, “O Badawi, take this ducat and draw near yonder
tent and call aloud, saying:—I am the owner of the calf; after
which make off with thy life for an they catch thee they will slay
thee.” “By Allah,” quoth the Arab, “even if they rode their
best mares none of them could come up with me!” So I took
charge of the sheep while the Badawi approaching the tent cried
in his loudest voice, “By Allah, I am the owner of the calf.”
Hearing this the vagabonds sprang to their feet as one body and
drew their weapons and rushed after the Badawi; but, when he
had run some distance from the tent with all the men behind him,
I went in and drawing from below my clothes the tail of the calf
said, “O Shayh, is this the tail of a calf or a kid?” The Elder
asked, “Art thou not he who cried out, I am the owner of the
calf?” and I answered, “No, I am not,” and came down upon him
with the tail and beat him until he could no longer breathe. Then
I took the properties belonging to his party and wrapping them in
a sheet carried them off and quitting the place I went in to my
mother and said to her, “Take them to the worth of the calf.”
Now those who had run after the Badawi ceased not pursuing him,
yet could none of them come up with him and when they were
tired they returned from the chase and stinted not walking until
they entered the tent. There they found the Shaykh breathless
nor could he move save to make signs; so they sprinkled a little
water upon his face; and the life returned to him and he said
to them, “Verily the owner of the calf came to me and beat me
till he killed me and the wight who cried, I am the owner of the
calf is an accomplice of his.” Thereupon all waxed furious and
the Elder said to them, “Bear me home and give out that your
Shaykh is deceased; after which do you bathe my body and carry
me to the cemetery and bury me by night and next morning disinter
me so that the owner of this calf may hear that I am dead and
leave me in peace. Indeed as long as I continue in this condition
he will devise for me device after device and some day will come
into me and kill me downright.” They did what their Shaykh
bade them and began crying and keening and saying, “Verily our
Chief is deceased,” so that the report was bruited abroad that the
Shaykh of the Vagabonds had died. But I, the owner of the calf,
said to myself, “By Allah, an he be dead, they will assuredly make
for him some mourning ceremony.” Now when they had washed
him and shrouded him and carried him out upon the bier, and
were proceeding to the graveyard that they might bury him, and
had reached half way to it, lo and behold! I joined the funeral
train and suddenly walking under the coffin with a sharp packing
needle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7011" id="noteref-7011" epub:type="noteref">7011</a> in hand,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that I walked
under the bier packing-needle in hand, and thrust it into the
Shaykh of the Vagabonds, whereat he cried out and sprang up
and sat upright upon his shell.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7012" id="noteref-7012" epub:type="noteref">7012</a> Now when the King heard this
tale he laughed and was cheered and the Larrikin resumed:—By
Allah, when I thrust the needle into him and he sat upright
in his coffin all the folk fell to wondering and cried, “Verily
the dead hath come to life.” Hereupon, O my lord, my fear
waxed great and I said to myself, “All adventures are not like
one another: haply the crowd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7013" id="noteref-7013" epub:type="noteref">7013</a> will recognise me and slay me.”
So I went forth the city and came hither. Cried the King, “Of a
truth, this tale is marvellous;” when the second Larrikin exclaimed,
“By Allah, O my lord, my tale is rarer and stranger
than this, for indeed therein I did deeds worthy of the Jinn-mad
and amongst the many tricks that came from my hand I died and
was buried and I devised a device whereby they drew me from my
tomb.” Quoth the King, “Walláhi, if thy tale be more wondrous
than that which forewent it I needs must reward thee with somewhat.
But now tell us of what betided thee.” So the man
began to relate the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>HISTORY OF THE SECOND LARRIKIN.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">I was living, O my lord, under the same roof with my father’s
wife and I had with me some bundles of sesame cobs, but no
great quantity, which I stored in a little basket hanging up in
the great ceiling-vault of our house. Now one day of the days
a party of merchants, numbering five or so, together with their
head man, came to our village and began asking for sesame;
and they happened to meet me on the road hard by our place, so
they put me the same question. I asked them, “Do you want
much of it?” and they answered, “We require<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7014" id="noteref-7014" epub:type="noteref">7014</a> about an hundred
ardabbs.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7015" id="noteref-7015" epub:type="noteref">7015</a> Quoth I, “By me is a large quantity thereof;” and
quoth they, “Have the kindness to show us the muster;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7016" id="noteref-7016" epub:type="noteref">7016</a> whereto
I rejoined, “Upon the head and the eye!” Hereat I led them
into the room wherein the basket was suspended with a few cobs
of sesame (there being none other) and I went up by an outside
staircase to the top of the vault, which I pierced, and putting forth
my hand, took up a palm-full and therewith returned to them
and showed the specimen. They saw that the sesame was clean
grain, and said one to other, “This house is naught but full to
the vault,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7017" id="noteref-7017" epub:type="noteref">7017</a> for had there been a small quantity there he would have
opened the door and shown us the heaps.” Hereupon I conversed
with them and settled the price and they paid me as earnest
money for an hundred ardabbs of sesame six hundred reals.
I took the coin and gave it to the wife of my father, saying to
her, “Cook for us a supper that shall be toothsome.” Then I
slaughtered for her five chickens and charged her that, after she
should have cooked the supper, she must prepare for us a pot of
Baysárah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7018" id="noteref-7018" epub:type="noteref">7018</a> which must be slab and thick. She did as I bade her
and I returned to the merchants and invited them to sup with us
and night in our house. Now when sunset time came I brought
them in for the evening meal and they supped and were cheered,
and as soon as the hour for night-prayer had passed I spread for
them sleeping-gear and said to them, “O our guests, be careful
of yourselves lest the wind come forth from your bellies, for with
me dwelleth the wife of my father, who disgusteth fizzles and
who dieth if she hear a fart.” After this they slept soundly from
the stress of their fatigue and were overwhelmed with slumber;
but when it was midnight, I took the pot of Baysarah and
approached them as they still slumbered and I besmeared<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7019" id="noteref-7019" epub:type="noteref">7019</a> their
backsides with the Baysarah and returned and slept until dawn of
day in my own stead hard beside them. At this time all five
were awake, and as each one arose before his companions he
sensed a somewhat soft below him and putting forth his hand
felt his bum bewrayed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7020" id="noteref-7020" epub:type="noteref">7020</a> with the stuff, and said to his neighbour,
“Ho, such an one, I have skited!” and the other said, “I also
have conskited myself;” and then all said together, “We have
skited.” But when I heard this, O my lord, I arose forthwith and
cried out saying, “Haste ye to my help, O ye folk, for these guests
have killed my father’s wife.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I should relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Forty-fifth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
second Larrikin to the King:—O my lord, I cried out saying, “The
guests have slain the wife of my father.” But when they heard
me the merchants arose and ran away, each following other, so I
rushed after them, shouting aloud, “Ye have killed my father’s
wife,” till such time as they had disappeared from sight. Then
said I to myself, “Inshallah! they will never more come back.”
But after they had disappeared for a whole year they returned and
demanded their coin, to wit, six hundred reals; and I, when the
tidings reached me, feigned myself dead and ordered my father’s
wife to bury me in the cemetery and I took to my grave a portion
of charcoal and a branding-iron. Now when the five merchants
came and asked after me the folk said, “He hath deceased and
they have graved him in his grave;” whereupon the creditors
cried, “By Allah, there is no help but that we go and piss upon
his fosse.” Now I had made a crevice in the tomb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7021" id="noteref-7021" epub:type="noteref">7021</a> and I had
lighted the charcoal and I had placed the branding-iron ready till
it became red hot and, when they came to piddle upon my
grave, I took the iron and branded their hinder cheeks with sore
branding, and this I did to one and all till the five had suffered in
the flesh. Presently they departed to their own country, when my
father’s wife came and opened the tomb and drew me forth and we
returned together to our home. After a time, however, the news
reached these merchants in their towns that I was living and
hearty, so they came once more to our village and demanded of
the Governor that I be given up to them. So the rulers sent for
and summoned me, but when the creditors made a claim upon me
for six hundred reals, I said to the Governor, “O my lord, verily
these five fellows were slaves to my sire in bygone-times.” Quoth
the ruler, “Were ye then in sooth chattels to his sire?” and said
they to me, “Thou liest!” Upon this I rejoined, “Bare their
bodies; and, if thou find a mark thereupon, they be my father’s
serviles, and if thou find no sign then are my words false.” So
they examined them and they found upon the rumps of the five,
marks of the branding-iron, and the Governor said, “By Allah, in
good sooth he hath told the truth and you five are the chattels of
his father.” Hereupon began dispute and debate between us, nor
could they contrive aught to escape from me until they paid me
three hundred reals in addition to what I had before of them.
When the Sultan heard these words from the Larrikin he fell to
wondering and laughing at what the wight had done and he said,
“By Allah, verily thy deed is the deed of a vagabond who is a
past-master in fraud.” Then the third Larrikin spoke and said,
“By Allah, in good sooth my story is more marvellous and
wondrous than the tales of this twain, for that none (methinketh)
save I could have done aught of the kind.” The King asked him
“And what may be thy story?” so he began to relate</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>THE HISTORY OF THE THIRD LARRIKIN.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">O my lord, I was once an owner of herds whereof naught remained
to me but a single bull well advanced in years and unhealthy of
flesh and of hide; and when I sought to sell him to the butchers
none was willing to buy him of me, nor even to accept him as a
gift. So I was disgusted with the beast and with the idea of
eating him; and, as he could not be used either to grind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7022" id="noteref-7022" epub:type="noteref">7022</a> or to
plough, I led him into a great courtyard, where I slaughtered him
and stripped off his hide. Then I cut the flesh into bittocks——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell

sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this

    <div>The Four Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the whilome
owner of the bull said to the King, “O my lord, I cut his flesh
into bittocks and went forth and cried aloud upon the dogs of the
quarter, when they all gathered together nor did one remain behind.
Then I caused them to enter the court and having bolted the
door gave to each dog a bit of the meat weighing half a pound.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7023" id="noteref-7023" epub:type="noteref">7023</a>
So all ate and were filled, after which I shut them up in the house
which was large, for a space of three days when, behold, the folk
came seeking their tykes and crying, “Whither can the curs have
gone?” So I related how I had locked them up within the house
and hereupon each man who had a hound came and took it away.
Then quoth I, “Thy dog hath eaten a full pound of flesh,” and
I took from each owner six faddahs and let him have his
beast until I had recovered for the meat of that bull a sum
of two thousand faddahs.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7024" id="noteref-7024" epub:type="noteref">7024</a> At last of these dogs there remained
to me but one unclaimed and he had only a single eye and
no owner. So I took up a staff and beat him and he ran away and
I ran after him to catch him until he came upon a house with
the door open and rushed within. Now by the decree of the
Decreer it so happened that the mistress of the house had a man
living with her who was one-eyed and I ran in and said to her,
“Bring out the one-eyed that is with thee,” meaning the dog. But
when the house mistress heard me say, “Bring out the one-eyed,” she
fancied that I spoke of her mate, so knowing naught about the matter
of the tyke she came up to me and cried, “Allah upon thee, O my
lord, do thou veil what Allah hath veiled and rend not our reputation
and deal not disgrace to us;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7025" id="noteref-7025" epub:type="noteref">7025</a> presently adding, “Take this
bangle from me and betray us not.” So I took it and left her and
went my ways, after which she returned to the house and her heart
was heaving and she found that her man had been in like case
ever since he heard me say, “Bring out the one-eyed.” So I went
away carrying off the bracelet and fared homeward. But when
she looked about the room, lo and behold! she espied the one-eyed
dog lying in a corner and, as soon as she caught sight of him, she
was certified that I had alluded to the beast. So she buffeted her
face and regretted the loss of her bangle and following me she came
up and said to me, “O my lord, I have found the one-eyed dog, so
do thou return with me and take him;” whereat I had pity upon
the woman and restored to her the ornament. However, when
this had befallen me, fear possessed my heart lest she denounce
me, and I went away from my village and came to this place where
the three of us forgathered and have lived ever since. When
the King had given ear to this story he was cheered and said, “By
Allah, verily the adventures of you three are wondrous, but my
desire of you is to know if any of you have heard aught of the
histories of bygone Sultans; and, if so, let him relate them to me.
First, however, I must take you into the city that you may enjoy
your rest.” “O my lord,” quoth they, “who art thou of the
citizens?” and quoth he, “I am the King of this country, and the
cause of my coming hither was my design to hunt and chase and
the finding you here hath diverted me therefrom.” But when they
heard his words, they forthwith rose to their feet and did him
obeisance saying, “Hearing and obeying,” after which the three
repaired with him to the city. Here the King commanded that
they set apart for them an apartment and appointed to them
rations of meat and drink and invested them with robes of honour;
and they remained in company one with other till a certain night of
the nights when the Sultan summoned them and they made act of
presence between his hands and the season was after the King had
prayed the Ishá<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7026" id="noteref-7026" epub:type="noteref">7026</a> prayers. So he said to them, “I require that
each and every of you who knoweth an history of the Kings of
yore shall relate it to me,” whereat said one of the four, “I have
by me such a tale.” Quoth the King, “Then tell it to us;” when
the first Larrikin began to relate the</p>

<p class="c013">There was in days of yore a King in the land of Al-Hind, who
reigned over wide dominions (and praise be to Him who ruleth the
worlds material and spiritual!), but this Sultan had nor daughter
nor son. So once upon a time he took thought and said, “Glory
to Thee! no god is there save Thyself, O Lord; withal Thou hast
not vouchsafed to me a child either boy or girl.” On the next day
he arose a-morn wholly clad in clothes of crimson hue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7028" id="noteref-7028" epub:type="noteref">7028</a>——And

other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King of
Al-Hind arose a-morn wholly clad in clothes of crimson hue, and
the Wazir, coming into the Divan, found him in such case. So he
salam’d to him and blessed him with the blessing due to Caliphs,
and said to him, “O King of the Age, doth aught irk thee that
thou art robed in red?” whereto he replied, “O Wazir, I have
risen with my heart gript hard.” Said the other, “Go into thy
treasury of moneys and jewels and turn over thy precious ores,
that thy sorrow be dispersed.” But said the Sultan, “O Wazir,
verily all this world is a transitory, and naught remaineth to any
save to seek the face of Allah the Beneficent: withal the like of
me may never more escape from cark and care, seeing that I have
lived for this length of time and that I have not been blessed with
or son or daughter, for verily children are the ornament of the
world.” Hereupon a wight dark of hue, which was a Takrúri<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7029" id="noteref-7029" epub:type="noteref">7029</a>
by birth, suddenly appeared before the Sultan and standing
between his hands said to him, “O King of the Age, I have by
me certain medicinal roots the bequeathal of my forbears and I
have heard that thou hast no issue; so an thou eat somewhat
thereof haply shall they gladden thy heart.” “Where be these
simples?” cried the King, whereat the Takruri man drew forth a
bag and brought out from it somewhat that resembled a confection
and gave it to him with due injunctions. So when it was nighttime
the Sultan ate somewhat of it and then slept with his wife
who, by the Omnipotence of Allah Almighty, conceived of him
that very time. Finding her pregnant the King was rejoiced
thereat and fell to distributing alms to the Fakirs and the mesquin
and the widows and the orphans, and this continued till the days of
his Queen’s pregnancy were completed. Then she bare a man-child
fair of face and form, which event caused the King perfect joy and
complete; and on that day when the boy was named Mahommed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7030" id="noteref-7030" epub:type="noteref">7030</a>
Son of the Sultan, he scattered full half his treasury amongst the
lieges. Then he bade bring for the babe wet-nurses who suckled
him until milktime ended, when they weaned him, after which he
grew every day in strength and stature till his age reached his
sixth year. Hereupon his father appointed for him a Divine to
teach him reading and writing and the Koran and all the sciences,
which he mastered when his years numbered twelve. And after
this he took to mounting horses and learning to shoot with shafts
and to hit the mark, up to the time when he became a knight
who surpassed all other knights. Now one day of the days Prince
Mahommed rode off a-hunting, as was his wont, when lo and
behold! he beheld a fowl with green plumage wheeling around him
in circles and rocketing in the air and seeing this he was desirous
to bring it down with an arrow. But he found this impossible
so he ceased not following the quarry with intent to catch it but
again he failed and it flew away from his ken; whereat he was
sore vexed and he said to himself, “Needs must I seize this bird,”
and he kept swerving to the right and the left in order to catch
sight of it but he saw it not. This endured until the end of day
when he returned to the city and sought his father and his mother,
and when they looked upon him they found his case changed and
they asked him concerning his condition, so he related to them
all about the bird and they said to him, “O our son, O Mahommed,
verily the creations of Allah be curious and how many fowls are
like unto this, nay even more wondrous.” Cried he, “Unless I
catch her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7031" id="noteref-7031" epub:type="noteref">7031</a> I will wholly give up eating.” Now when morning
dawned he mounted according to his custom and again went forth
to the chase; and presently he pushed into the middle of the
desert when suddenly he saw the bird flying in air and he pushed
his horse to speed beneath her and shot at her a shaft with the
intent to make her his prey, but again was unable to kill the bird.
He persisted in the chase from sunrise until sundown when he was
tired and his horse was aweary, so he turned him round purposing
a return city-wards, when behold, he was met in the middle of the
road by an elderly man who said to him, “O son of the Sultan,
in very sooth thou art fatigued and on like wise is thy steed.”
The Prince replied, “Yes,” and the Elder asked him, “What is the
cause thereof?” Accordingly he told him all anent the bird and
the Shaykh replied to him, “O my son, an thou absent thyself
and ride for a whole year in pursuit of yonder fowl thou wilt
never be able to take her; and, O my child, where is this bird!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7032" id="noteref-7032" epub:type="noteref">7032</a>
I will now inform thee that in a City of the Islands hight of
Camphor there is a garden wide of sides wherein are many of such
fowls and far fairer than this, and of them some can sing and
others can speak with human speech; but, O my son, thou art
unable to reach that city. However, if thou leave this bird and
seek another of the same kind, haply I can show thee one and
thou wilt not weary thyself any more.” When Mohammed, Son
of the Sultan, heard these words from the Elder he cried, “By
Allah, ’tis not possible but that I travel to that city.” Hereupon
he left the Shaykh and returned to his own home, but his heart
was engrossed with the Capital of the Camphor Islands, and when
he went in to his sire, his case was troubled. The father asked
him thereof and he related to him what the oldster had said. “O
my son,” quoth the sire, “cast out this accident from thy heart
and weary not thy soul, inasmuch as whoso would seek an object
he cannot obtain, shall destroy his own life for the sake thereof
and furthermore he shall fail of his gain. Better therefore thou
set thy heart at rest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7033" id="noteref-7033" epub:type="noteref">7033</a> and weary thyself no more.” Quoth the Son,
“Walláhi, O my sire, verily my heart is hung to yonder fowl and
specially to the words of the Elder; nor is it possible to me to sit
at home until I shall have reached the city of the Camphor Islands
and I shall have gazed upon the gardens wherein such fowls do
wone.” Quoth his father, “But why, O my child, wouldst thou
deprive us of looking upon thee?” And quoth the son, “There
is no help but that I travel.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where
is this compared with that I should relate to you on the coming

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Mohammed
the Son of the Sultan cried, “Needs must I travel, otherwise I will
slay myself.” “There is no Majesty and there is no Might,” quoth
the father, “save in Allah the Glorious, the Great; and saith the
old saw, ‘The chick is unsatisfied till the crow see it and carry it
off.’”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7034" id="noteref-7034" epub:type="noteref">7034</a> Thereupon the King gave orders to get ready provisions
and other matters required for the Prince’s wayfare, and he sent
with him an escort of friends and servants, after which the youth
took leave of his father and mother and he with his many set forth
seeking the Capital of the Camphor Islands. He ceased not
travelling for the space of an entire month till he arrived at a
place wherein three highways forked, and he saw at the junction a
huge rock whereon were written three lines. Now the first read,
“This is the road of safe chance,” and the second, “This is the
way of repentance,” and the third, “This is the path whereon
whoso paceth shall return nevermore.” When the Prince perused
these inscriptions he said to himself, “I will tread the path whereon
whoso paceth shall nevermore return.” Then he put his trust in
Allah, and he travelled over that way for a space of days a score,
when suddenly he came upon a city deserted and desolate, nor
was there a single created thing therein and it was utterly in ruins.
So he alighted beside it and, as a flock of sheep accompanied his
suite, he bade slaughter five lambs and commanded the cooks to
prepare of them delicate dishes and to roast one of them whole and
entire. They did his bidding, and when the meats were cooked
he ordered the trays be spread in that site and, as soon as all was
done to his satisfaction, he purposed sitting down to food, he and
his host, when suddenly an ’Aun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7035" id="noteref-7035" epub:type="noteref">7035</a> appeared coming from the
ruined city. But when Prince Mohammed beheld him he rose to
him in honour saying, “Welcome and fair welcome to him who of
’Auns is the head, and to the brethren friend true-bred,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7036" id="noteref-7036" epub:type="noteref">7036</a> and the
Haunter of this stead;” and he satisfied him with the eloquence of
his tongue and the elegance of his speech. Now this ’Aun had
hair that overhung either eye and fell upon his shoulders, so the
Prince brought out his scissors<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7037" id="noteref-7037" epub:type="noteref">7037</a> and trimmed his locks clearing
them away from his face, and he pared his nails which were like
talons, and finally let bathe his body with warm water. Then he
served up to him the barbecue of lamb which he caused to be
roasted whole for the use of the Jinni and bade place it upon the
tray, so the Haunter ate with the travellers and was cheered by
the Prince’s kindness and said to him, “By Allah, O my lord
Mohammed, O thou Son of the Sultan, I was predestined to meet
thee in this place but now let me know what may be thy need.”
Accordingly the youth informed him of the city of the Camphor
Islands and of the garden containing the fowls which he fared to
seek, and of his design in wayfaring thither to bring some of them
away with him. But when the ’Aun heard from him these words,
he said to him, “O thou Son of the Sultan, that site is a far cry for
thee, nor canst thou ever arrive thereat unless assisted, seeing that
its distance from this place be a march of two hundred years for
a diligent traveller. How then canst thou reach it and return
from it? However, the old saw saith, O my son, ‘Good for good
and the beginner is worthier, and ill for ill and the beginner is
unworthier.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7038" id="noteref-7038" epub:type="noteref">7038</a> Now thou hast done to me a kindly deed and I
(Inshallah!) will requite thee with its match and will reward thee
with its mate; but let whatso is with thee of companions and
slaves and beasts and provisions abide in this site and we will go
together, I and thou, and I will win for thee thy wish even as thou
hast wrought by me a kindly work.” Hereupon the Prince left all
that was with him in that place and the ’Aun said to him, “O son
of the Sultan, come mount upon my shoulders.” The youth did
accordingly, after he had filled his ears with cotton, and the ’Aun
rose from earth and towered in air and after the space of an hour
he descended again and the rider found himself in the grounds
about the capital of the Camphor Islands. So he dismounted
from the Jinni’s shoulders and looked about that Wady where he
espied pleasant spots and he descried trees and blooms and rills and
birds that trilled and shrilled with various notes. Then quoth the
’Aun to him, “Go forth to yonder garden and thence bring thy
need;” so he walked thither and, finding the gates wide open, he
passed in and fell to solacing himself with looking to the right and
the left. Presently he saw bird-cages suspended and in them were
fowls of every kind, to each two, so he walked up to them and
whenever he noted a bird that pleased him he took it and caged it
till he had there six fowls and of all sorts twain. Then he designed
to leave the garden when suddenly a keeper met him face to face
at the door crying aloud, “A thief! a thief!” Hereat all the
other gardeners rushed up and seized him, together with the
cage, and carried him before the King, the owner of that garden
and lord of that city. They set him in the presence saying,
“Verily we found this young man stealing a cage wherein be fowls
and in good sooth he must be a thief.” Quoth the Sultan, “Who
misled thee, O Youth, to enter my grounds and trespass thereon and
take of my birds?” Whereto the Prince returned no reply. So
the Sultan resumed, “By Allah, thou hast wilfully wasted thy life,
but, O Youngster, an it be thy desire to take my birds and carry
them away, do thou go and bring me from the capital of the Isles
of the Súdán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7039" id="noteref-7039" epub:type="noteref">7039</a> bunches of grapes which are clusters of diamonds
and emeralds, when I will give thee over and above these six fowls
six other beside.” So the Prince left him and going to the ’Aun
informed him of what had befallen him, and the other cried, “’Tis
easy, O Mohammed;” and mounting him upon his shoulders flew with
him for the space of two hours and presently alighted. The youth
saw himself in the lands surrounding the capital of the Sudan Islands
which he found more beautiful than the fair region he had left; and
he designed forthright to approach the garden containing great
clusters of diamonds and emeralds, when he was confronted by a
Lion in the middle way. Now it was the wont of this beast yearly
to visit that city and to pounce upon everything he met of women
as well as of men; so seeing the Prince he charged down upon him,
designing to rend him limb from limb.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Lion charged down
upon Mohammed, Son of the Sultan, designing to rend him in
pieces, but he confronted him and unsheathing his scymitar made
it glitter in the sunshine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7040" id="noteref-7040" epub:type="noteref">7040</a> and pressed him close and bashed him
with brand between his eyes so that the blade came forth
gleaming from between his thighs. Now by doom of Destiny the
daughter of the Sultan was sitting at the latticed window of her
belvedere and was looking at her glass and solacing herself, when
her glance fell upon the King’s son as he was smiting the Lion.
So she said to herself, “May thy hand never palsied grow nor
exult over thee any foe!” But the Prince after slaying the Lion
left the body and walked into the garden whose door had been
left open and therein he found that all the trees were of precious
metal bearing clusters like grapes of diamonds and emeralds. So
he went forwards and plucked from those trees six bunches which
he placed within a cage, when suddenly he was met by the keeper
who cried out, “A thief! a thief!” and when joined by the other
gardeners seized him and bore him before the Sultan saying, “O
my lord, I have come upon this youth who was red-handed in
robbing yonder clusters.” The King would have slain him forthright,
but suddenly there came to him a gathering of the folk
who cried, “O King of the Age, a gift of good news!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7041" id="noteref-7041" epub:type="noteref">7041</a> Quoth
he, “Wherefore?” and quoth they, “Verily the Lion which was
wont hither to come every year and to pounce upon all that met
him of men and of women and of maidens and of children, we
have found him in such a place clean slain and split into twain.”
Now the Sultan’s daughter was standing by the lattice of the
belvedere which was hard by the Divan of her sire and was
looking at the youth who stood before the King and was awaiting
to see how it would fare with him. But when the folk came
in and reported the death of the Lion, the Sultan threw aside
the affair of the youth of his joy and delight and fell to asking,
“Who was it slew the beast?” and to saying, “Walláhi! By the
rights of my forbears in this kingdom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7042" id="noteref-7042" epub:type="noteref">7042</a> let him who killed the
monster come before me and ask of me a boon which it shall be
given to him; nay, even if he demand of me a division of all my
good he shall receive that same.” But when he had heard of all
present that the tidings were true then the city-folk followed one
another in a line and went in to the Sultan and one of them said,
“I have slain the Lion.” Said the King, “And how hast thou slain<a id="t307"></a>
him; and in what manner hast thou been able to prevail over and
master him?” Then he spake with him softly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7043" id="noteref-7043" epub:type="noteref">7043</a> and proved him
and at last so frightened him that the man fell to the ground in his
consternation; when they carried him off and the King declared,
“This wight lieth!” All this and Mohammed, the Son of the
Sultan, was still standing and looking on and when he heard the
man’s claim he smiled. Suddenly the King happening to glance
at him saw the smile and was astounded and said in his mind,
“By Allah, this Youth is a wondrous for he smileth he being in
such case as this.” But behold, the King’s daughter sent an
eunuch to her father and he delivered the message, when the King
arose and went into his Harem and asked her, “What is in thy
mind and what is it thou seekest?” She answered, “Is it thy
desire to know who slew the Lion that thou mayest largesse
him?” and he rejoined, saying, “By virtue of Him who created
His servants and computeth their numbers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7044" id="noteref-7044" epub:type="noteref">7044</a> when I know him
and am certified of his truth my first gift to him shall be to wed
thee with him and he shall become to me son-in-law were he in
the farthest of lands.” Retorted she, “By Allah, O my father,
none slew the Lion save the young man who entered the garden
and carried off the clusters of gems, the youth whom thou art
minded to slay.” When he heard these words from his daughter,
the King returned to the Divan and bade summon Mohammed the
Son of the Sultan, and when they set him between his hands he
said to him, “O Youth, thou hast indemnity from me and say me,
art thou he who slew the Lion?” The other answered, “O King,
I am indeed young in years; how then shall I prevail over a Lion
and slaughter him, when, by Allah, in all my born days I have
never met even with a hyena much less with a lion? However,
O King of the Age, an thou largesse me with these clusters of
gems and give them to me in free gift, I will wend my ways, and if
not my luck will be with Allah!” Rejoined the King, “O Youth,
speak thou sooth and fear not!” Here he fell to soothing him
with words and solacing him and gentling him, after which he
threatened him with his hand, but Mohammed the Son of the
Sultan raised his neave swiftlier than the lightning and smote the
King and caused him swoon. Now there was none present in the
Divan save Mohammed and the Monarch, who after an hour came
to himself and said, “By Allah, thou art he who slew the Lion!”
Hereupon he robed him with a robe of honour and, summoning
the Kazi, bade tie the marriage-tie with his daughter; but quoth
the young man, “O King of the Age, I have a counsel to consult,
after which I will return to thee.” Quoth the King, “Right rede
is this same and a matter not to blame.” Accordingly the Prince
repaired to the ’Aun in the place where he had left him and related
to him all that had betided himself, and of his intended marriage
with the King’s daughter, whereupon said the Jinni, “Condition
with him that if thou take her to wife thou shalt carry her along
with thee to thine own country.” The youth did his bidding and
returned to the King who said, “There is no harm in that,” and
the marriage-knot was duly knotted. Then the bridegroom was
led in procession to his bride with whom he remained a full month
of thirty days, after which he craved leave to fare for his own
motherland,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and

    <div>The Four Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Mohammed Son
of the Sultan craved leave to return to his own motherland, when his
father-in-law gave him an hundred clusters of the diamantine and
smaragdine grapes, after which he farewelled the King and taking his
bride fared without the city. Here he found expecting him the ’Aun,
who, after causing them to fill their ears with cotton, shouldered him,
together with his wife, and then flew with them through the firmament
for two hours or so and alighted with them near the capital of
the Camphor Islands. Presently Mohammed the Son of the Sultan
took four clusters of the emeralds and diamonds, and going in to the
King laid them before him and drew him back. The Sultan gazed
upon them and marvelled and cried, “Walláhi! doubtless this
youth be a Magician for that he hath covered a space of three
hundred years in three<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7045" id="noteref-7045" epub:type="noteref">7045</a> of coming and going, and this is amongst
the greatest of marvels.” Presently he resumed, saying, “O Youth,
hast thou reached the city of the Sudan?” and the other replied,
“I have.” The King continued, “What is its description and its
foundation and how are its gardens and its rills?” So he informed
him of all things required of him and the Sultan cried, “By Allah,
O Youth, thou deservest all thou askest of me.” “I ask for
nothing,” said the Prince, “save the birds,” and the King, “O
Youth, there is with us in our town a Vulture which cometh every
year from behind Mount Káf and pounceth upon the sons of this
city and beareth them away and eateth them on the heads of the
hills. Now an thou canst master this monster-fowl and slay that
same I have a daughter whom I will marry to thee.” Quoth the
Prince, “I have need of taking counsel;” and returned to the
’Aun to inform him thereof when behold, the Vulture made its
appearance. But as soon as the Jinni espied it, he flew and made
for it, and caught it up; then, smiting it with a single stroke of his
hand, he cut it in two and presently he returned and settled down
upon the ground. Then, after a while, he went back to Mohammed,
the Son of the Sultan, and said to him, “Hie thee to the King and
report to him the slaughter of the Vulture.” So he went and
entering the presence reported what had taken place, whereupon
the Sultan with his lords of the land mounted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7046" id="noteref-7046" epub:type="noteref">7046</a> their horses, and,
going to the place, found the monster killed, and cut into two
halves. Anon the King returned, and leading Prince Mohammed
with him bade knit the marriage-knot with his daughter and
caused him to pay her the first visit. He tarried beside her for a
full-told month after which he asked leave to travel and to seek
the city of his first spouse, carrying with him the second. Hereupon
the King his father-in-law presented to him ten cages, each
containing four birds of vari-coloured coats and farewelled him.
After which he fared forth and left the city, and outside it he
found the ’Aun awaiting him and the Jinni salam’d to the Prince
and congratulated him in what he had won of gifts and prizes.
Then he arose high in air, bearing Mohammed and his two brides
and all that was with them, and he winged his way for an hour or
so until he alighted once more at the ruined city. Here he found
the Prince’s suite of learned men, together with the bât-beasts and
their loads<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7047" id="noteref-7047" epub:type="noteref">7047</a> and everything other even as he had left it. So they
sat down to take their rest when the ’Aun said, “O Mohammed,
O Son of the Sultan, I have been predestined to thee in this site
whither thou wast fated to come; but I have another and a further
covenant to keep wherewith I would charge thee.” “What is
that?” quoth he, and quoth the ’Aun, “Verily thou shalt not
depart this place until thou shalt have laved me and shrouded me
and graved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7048" id="noteref-7048" epub:type="noteref">7048</a> me in the ground;” and so saying he shrieked a loud
shriek and his soul fled his flesh. This was grievous to the son of
the King and he and his men arose and washed him and shrouded
him and having prayed over him buried him in the earth. After
this the Prince turned him to travel, so they laded the loads and
he and his set forth intending for their families and native land.
They journeyed during the space of thirty days till they reached
the fork of the highway whereat stood the great rock, and here they
found tents and pavilions and a host nor did they know what this
mighty many might mean. Now the father, when his son left him,
suffered from straitness of breast and was sore perplexed as to his
affair and he wot not what to do; so he bade make ready his army
and commanded the lords of the land to prepare for the march and
all set out seeking his son and determined to find tidings of him.
Nor did they cease faring till they reached the place where the
road forked into three and on the first rock they saw written the
three lines—“This is the road of safe chance;” and “This is the
way of repentance;” and “This is the path whereon whoso paceth
shall return nevermore.” But when the father read it he was
posed and perplext as to the matter and he cried, “Would Heaven
I knew by which road of these three my son Mohammed may have
travelled;” and as he was brooding over this difficulty——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I should relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as the Sultan
was brooding over this difficulty lo and behold! his son Mohammed
appeared before him by the path which showed written, “This is
the path whereon whoso passeth shall nevermore return.” But
when the King saw him, and face confronted face, he arose and
met him and salam’d to him giving him joy of his safety; and the
Prince told him all that had befallen him from beginning to end—how
he had not reached those places save by the All-might of
Allah, and how he had succeeded in winning his wish by meeting
with the ’Aun. So they nighted in that site and when it was
morning they resumed their march, all in gladness and happiness
for that the Sultan had recovered his son Mohammed. They
ceased not faring a while until they drew near their native city
when the bearers of good tidings ran forward announcing the
arrival of the Sultan and his son, and hereupon the houses were
decorated in honour of the Prince’s safe return and crowds came
out to meet them till such time as all had entered the city-walls,
after which their joys increased and their annoy fell from them.
And this is the whole of the tale told by the first Larrikin. Now
when the Sultan heard it he marvelled at what had befallen the
chief adventurer therein, when the second Larrikin spoke saying
“I have by me a tale, a marvel of marvels, and which is a delight
to the hearer and a diversion to the reader and to the reciter.”
Quoth the Sovran, “What may that be, O Shaykh?” and the man
fell to relating the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>TALE OF THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SON.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">They tell that whilome there was a Fisherman, a poor man with a
wife and family, who every day was wont to take his net and go
down to the river a-fishing for his daily bread which is distributed.
Then he would sell a portion of his catch and buy victual and the
rest he would carry to his wife and children that they might eat.
One day of the many days he said to his son who was growing up
to a biggish lad, “O my child, come forth with me this morning,
haply All-Mighty Allah may send us somewhat of livelihood by
thy footsteps;” and the other answered, “’Tis well, O my father.”
Hereupon the Fisherman took his son and his net and they twain
went off together till they arrived at the river-bank, when quoth
the father, “O my boy I will throw the net upon the luck of thee.”
Then he went forward to the water and standing thereby took his
net and unfolded it so that it spread when entering the stream,
and after waiting an hour or so he drew it in and found it heavy of
weight: so he cried, “O my son, bear a hand” and the youth came
up and lent him aidance in drawing it in. And when they had
haled it to shore they opened it and found a fish of large size and
glittering with all manner of colours. Quoth the father, “O my
son, by Allah, this fish befitteth not any but the Caliph; do thou
therefore abide with it till I go and fetch a charger wherein to
carry it as an offering for the Prince of True Believers.” The
youth took his seat by the fish and when his father was afar off
he went up to her and said, “Doubtless thou hast children and
the byword saith, Do good and cast it upon the waters.” Then
he took up the fish and setting her near the river besprinkled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7049" id="noteref-7049" epub:type="noteref">7049</a>
her and said, “Go thou to thy children, this is even better than
being eaten by the Caliph.” But having thrown the fish into the
stream, his fear of his father grew strong upon him, so he arose
and without stay or delay fled his village; and he ceased not flying
till he reached the Land of Al-Irák whose capital was under a
King wide of dominions (and praise be to the King of all kingdoms!)
So he entered the streets and presently he met a baker-man
who said to him, “O my son, wilt thou serve?” whereto he
replied, “I will serve, O uncle.” The man settled with him for a
wage of two silver nusfs a day together with his meat and his
drink, and he remained working with him for a while of time.
Now on one day of the days behold, he saw a lad of the sons of
that city carrying about a cock with the intention of vending it,
when he was met by a Jew who said to him, “O my child, wilt
thou sell this fowl?” and the other said, “I will.” Quoth the
Jew, “For ten faddahs?” and quoth the youth, “Allah openeth!”
Said the other, “For twenty faddahs?” and the lad, “Allah
veileth!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7050" id="noteref-7050" epub:type="noteref">7050</a> Then the Jew fell to increasing his offer for the cock
until he reached a full dinar.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I should relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Jew raised
his bid for the cock till he reached a gold piece when the lad said
“Here with it.” So the man gave him the dinar and took from
him the fowl and slaughtered it forthright. Then he turned to a
boy, one of his servants, and said to him, “Take this cock and
carry it home and say to thy mistress:—Pluck it, but open it
not until such time as I shall return.” And the servant did his
bidding. But when the Fisherman’s son who was standing hard
by heard these words and saw the bargain, he waited for a while
and as soon as the servant had carried off the fowl, he arose and
buying two cocks at four faddahs he slaughtered them and
repaired with them to the house of the Jew. Then he rapped at
the door and when the mistress came out to him he bespoke her
saying:—“The house master saith to thee, Take these two silvers and
send me the bird which was brought to thee by the servant boy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7051" id="noteref-7051" epub:type="noteref">7051</a>
Quoth she, “’Tis well,” so he gave her the two fowls and took
from her the cock which her husband had slaughtered. Then he
returned to the bakery, and when he was private he opened the
belly of the cock and found therein a signet-ring with a bezel-gem
which in the sun showed one colour and in the shade another. So
he took it up and hid it in his bosom, after which he gutted the
bird and cooked it in the furnace and ate it. Presently the Jew
having finished his business, returned home and said to his wife,
“Bring me the cock.” She brought him the two fowls and he
seeing them asked her, “But where be the first cock?” And she
answered him, “Thou thyself sentest the boy with these two birds
and then orderedst him to bring thee the first cock.” The Jew held
his peace but was sore distressed at heart, so sore indeed that he
came nigh to die and said to himself, “Indeed it hath slipped from
my grasp!” Now the Fisherman’s son after he had mastered the
ring waited until the evening evened when he said; “By Allah,
needs must this bezel have some mystery;” so he withdrew into
the privacy of the furnace and brought it out from his bosom and
fell a-rubbing it. Thereupon the Slave of the Ring appeared and
cried, “Here I stand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7052" id="noteref-7052" epub:type="noteref">7052</a> between thy hands.” Then the Fisherman’s
son said to himself, “This indeed is the perfection of good fortune.”
and returned the gem to his breast-pocket as it was. Now when
morning morrowed the owner of the bakery came in and the youth
said to him, “O my master, I am longing for my people and my
native land and ’tis my desire to fare and look upon them and
presently I will return to thee.” So the man paid him his wage,
after which he left him and walked from the bakery till he came
to the Palace of the Sultan where he found near the gate well nigh
an hundred heads which had been cut off and there suspended; so
he leaned for rest against the booth of a sherbet-seller and asked
its owner, “O master, what is the cause of all these heads being
hung up?” and the other answered, “O my son, inquire not,
anent what hath been done.” However when he repeated the
question the man replied, “O my son, verily the Sultan hath a
daughter, a model of beauty and loveliness, of symmetric stature
and perfect grace, in fact likest a branch of the Rattan-palm;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7053" id="noteref-7053" epub:type="noteref">7053</a> and
whoso cometh ever to seek her in marriage her father conditioneth
with him a condition.” Cried the Fisherman’s son, “What may
be that condition?” and the other replied, “There is a great
mound of ashes under the latticed windows of the Sultan’s palace,
and whoso wisheth to take his daughter to wife he maketh a
covenant with him that he shall carry off that heap. So the other
accepted the agreement with only the proviso that he should
have forty days grace and he consented that, an he fail within
that time, his head be cut off.” “And the heap is high?” quoth
the Fisherman’s son. “Like a hill,” quoth the other. Now when
the youth had thoroughly comprehended what the sherbet-seller
had told him, he farewelled him and left him; then, going to a
Khan, he hired him a cell and taking seat therein for a time he
pondered how he should proceed, for he was indeed fearful yet was
his heart hanging to the love of the Sultan’s daughter. Presently
he brought out his ring, and rubbed it, when the voice of the Slave
cried to him, “Here I stand between thy hands and what mayst thou
require of me?” Said the other, “I want a suit of kingly clothes;”
whereat without delay a bundle was set before him and when he
opened it he found therein princely gear. So he took it and rising
without loss of time he went into the Hammam and caused himself
to be soaped and gloved and thoroughly washed, after which he
donned the dress and his case was changed into other case——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the son of
the Fisherman came forth the Bath-house and donned his fine dress,
his was changed into other case and he appeared before the folk in
semblance of the sons of Kings. Presently he went to the Sultan’s
palace and entering therein made his salam and, blushing for
modesty, did his obeisance and blessed the Sultan with the blessing
due to Caliphs. His greetings were returned and the King welcomed
him and after that looked at him, and finding him after princely
fashion, asked him, “What is thy need, O Youth, and what
requirest thou?” Answered the other, “I seek connection with thy
house, and I come desirous of betrothal with the lady concealed
and the pearl unrevealed, which is thy daughter.” “Art thou
able to perform the condition, O Youth?” asked the King; “For
I want neither means nor moneys nor precious stones nor other
possession; brief, none other thing save that thou remove yon
mound of ashes from beneath the windows of my palace.” Upon
this he bade the youth draw near him and when he obeyed threw
open the lattice; and, showing him the hillock that stood underneath
it, said, “O Youth, I will betroth to thee my daughter an
thou be pleased to remove this heap; but if thou prove thee unable
so to do I will strike off thy head.” Quoth the Fisherman’s son,
“I am satisfied therewith,” presently adding, “A delay!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7054" id="noteref-7054" epub:type="noteref">7054</a> grant me
the term of forty days.” “I have allowed thy request to thee,”
said the King and wrote a document bearing the testimony of
those present, when cried the youth, “O King, bid nail up thy
windows and let them not be unfastened until the fortieth day
shall have gone by.” “These words be fair,” quoth the Sultan, and
accordingly he gave the order. Hereat the youth went forth from him
whereupon all present in the palace cried, “O the pity of it, that this
youngster should be done to die; indeed there were many stronger
than he, yet none of them availed to remove the heap.” In this
way each and every said his say, but when the Fisherman’s son
returned to his cell (and he was thoughtful concerning his life and
perplext as to his affair) he cried, “Would Heaven I knew whether
the Ring hath power to carry it off.” Then shutting himself up
in his cell he brought out the signet from his breast-pocket and
rubbed it, and a Voice was heard to cry, “Here I stand (and fair
befal thy command) between thy hands. What requirest thou of
me, O my lord?” The other replied, “I want thee to remove
the ash-heap which standeth under the windows of the royal
palace, and I demand that thou lay out in lieu thereof a garden
wide of sides in whose middlemost must be a mansion tall and
choice-builded of base, for the special domicile of the Sultan’s
daughter: furthermore, let all this be done within the space of
forty days.” “Aye ready,” quoth the Jinni, “to do all thou
desirest.” Hereupon the youth felt his affright assuaged and his
heart rightly directed; and after this he would go every day to
inspect the heap and would find one quarter of it had disappeared,
nor did aught of it remain after the fourth morning for that the
ring was graved with the cabalistic signs of the Cohens<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7055" id="noteref-7055" epub:type="noteref">7055</a> and they
had set upon the work an hundred Marids of the Jann that they
might carry out the wishes of any who required aught of them.
And when the mound was removed they dispread in its site a garden
wide of sides in whose midst they edified a palace choice-builded
of base, and all this was done within the space of fifteen days,
whilst the Fisherman’s son ever repaired thither and inspected the
work. But when he had perfected his intent he entered to the
Sultan and kissing ground between his hands and having prayed
for his glory and permanence, said, “O King of the Age, deign
open the lattices of thy Palace!” So he went to them and threw
them open when lo and behold, he found in lieu of the mound
a mighty fine garden wherein were trees and rills and blooms and
birds hymning the praises of their Creator; moreover he saw in
that garden a palace, an edifice choice-builded of base which is
not to be found with any King or Kaysar. Seeing this he wondered
at the circumstance and his wits were wildered and he was
perplext as to his affair; after which he sent for the Minister and
summoned him and said, “Counsel me, O Wazir, as to what I shall
do in the case of this youth and in what way shall I fend him
from me.” Replied the Councillor, “How shall I advise thee, seeing
that thou madest condition with him that should he fail in his
undertaking thou wouldst strike off his head? Now there is no
contrivance in this matter and there is naught to do save marrying
him with the girl.” By these words the King was persuaded and
caused the knot to be knotted and bade them lead the bridegroom
in procession to the bride, after which the youth set her in the
garden-palace and cohabited with her in all joy and enjoyment and
pleasure and disport. On this wise fared it with them; but as regards
the case of the Jew, when he lost the cock he went forth in sore disappointment
like unto one Jinn-mad; and neither was his sleep
sound and good nor were meat and drink pleasant food, and he
ceased not wandering about till the Fates threw him into that
garden. Now he had noted in past time that a huge heap of ashes
stood under the palace-windows and when he looked he cried,
“Verily, the youth hath been here and all this work is the work of
the signet-ring, for that none other than the Márids of the Jánn
could remove such a hillock.” So saying, the Jew returned to his
place, where he brought out a parcel of fine pearls and some few
emeralds and specimens of coral and other precious minerals, and
set them as for sale in a tray. Then he approached the palace
which was builded in the garden and cried out saying, “The
pearls! and the emeralds! and the corals! and various kinds of
fine jewels!” and he kept up this cry.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
should relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that
was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Jew fell
to hawking about his minerals and crying them for sale beside the
garden-palace and the Sultan’s daughter hearing him exclaimed,
“O Handmaid, bring me that which is for sale with this Jew.” So
the girl went down and said to the man, “What hast thou by
thee?” and said the other, “Precious stones.” Quoth she, “Wilt
thou sell them for gold?” and quoth he, “No, O my lady, I will
sell them for nothing save for rings which must be old.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7056" id="noteref-7056" epub:type="noteref">7056</a> Accordingly
she returned and herewith acquainted her lady who said,
“By Allah, my Lord hath in his pencase<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7057" id="noteref-7057" epub:type="noteref">7057</a> an old worn-out ring, so
do thou go and bring it to me while he sleepeth.” But she knew
not what was hidden for her in the Secret Purpose, nor that which
was fated to be her Fate. So presently she brought out of the
pencase the bezel ring afore-mentioned and gave it to the handmaid
who took it and faring outside the house handed it to the
Jew, and he received it with extreme joy and in turn presented to
her the tray with all thereon. Then he went forth the city and set
out on a voyage to the Seven Islands which are not far from the
earth-surrounding Ocean;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7058" id="noteref-7058" epub:type="noteref">7058</a> and when he arrived thither he landed
upon a sea-holm and travelled to the middlemost thereof. Anon
he took seat, and presently brought out the signet-ring and rubbed
it, when the slave appeared and cried, “Here I stand and between
thy hands, what is it thou needest of me?” “I require of thee,”
quoth the Jew, “to transport hither the bower of the Sultan’s
daughter and to restore the ash-heap to the stead it was in
whilome under the lattice of the King’s Palace.” Now ere night
had passed away both Princess and Palace were transported to
the middlemost of the island; and when the Jew beheld her his
heart flamed high for the excess of her beauty and loveliness. So
he entered her bower and fell to conversing with her, but she
would return to him no reply and, when he would have approached
her, she started away in disgust. Hereupon, seeing no signs of
conquest, the Jew said in his mind, “Let her wax accustomed to
me and she will be satisfied,” and on this wise he continued to
solace her heart. Now as regards the son of the Fisherman his
sleep had extended deep into the forenoon and when the sun
burnt upon his back he arose and found himself lying on the ash-heap
below the Palace, so he said to himself, “Up and away,
otherwise the Sultan will look out of the window and will behold
this mound returned to its place as it was before, and he will order
thy neck to be smitten.” So he hurried him forth hardly believing
in his escape, and he ceased not hastening his pace until he came
to a coffee-house, which he entered; and there he took him a lodging
and used to lie the night, and to rise a-morn. Now one day of the
days behold, he met a man who was leading about a dog and a cat
and a mouse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7059" id="noteref-7059" epub:type="noteref">7059</a> and crying them for sale at the price of ten faddahs;
so the youth said in his mind, “Let me buy these at their cheap
price;” and he called aloud to the man and having given him the
ten silverings took away his purchase. After this he would fare
every day to the slaughter-house and would buy for them a bit of
tripe or liver and feed them therewith, but ever and anon he would
sit down and ponder the loss of the Ring and bespeak himself and
say, “Would Heaven I wot that which Allah Almighty hath done
with my Ring and my Palace and my bride the Sultan’s daughter!”
Now the dog and the cat and the mouse heard him, and one day
of the days as, according to his custom, he took them with him
and led them to the slaughter-house and bought a meal of entrails
and gave somewhat to each that it might eat thereof, he sat down
in sad thought and groaned aloud and sorrow prevailed upon him
till he was overcome by sleep. The season was the mid-forenoon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7060" id="noteref-7060" epub:type="noteref">7060</a>
and the while he slumbered and was drowned in drowsiness, the
Dog said to the Cat and the Mouse, “O brethren mine, in very
deed this youth, who hath bought us for ten faddahs, leadeth us
every day to this stead and giveth us our rations of food. But
he hath lost his Ring and the Palace wherein was his bride, the
daughter of the Sultan: so let us up and fare forth and seek
therefor and do ye twain mount upon my back so that we can
overwander the seas and the island-skirts.” They did as he bade
them and he walked down with them to the waters and swam with
them until they found themselves amiddlemost the main; nor did
he cease swimming with them for about a day and a night until
the morning morrowed and they saw from afar a somewhat that
glittered. So they made for it till they drew near, when they saw
that it was the Palace in question, whereat the Dog continued
swimming till such time as he came ashore and dismounted the
Cat and the Mouse. Then he said to them, “Let us abide here.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I should relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Dog said to
the Cat and the Mouse, “I will abide and await you here, and
do ye twain fare into the Palace, where the Cat shall take her
station upon the crenelles over the lattice window and the Mouse
shall enter the mansion and roam about and search through the
rooms until she come upon the Ring required.” So they did the
Dog’s bidding and sought the places he had appointed to them
and the Mouse crept about but found naught until she approached
the bedstead and beheld the Jew asleep and the Princess lying
afar off. He had been longsome in requiring of her her person
and had even threatened her with slaughter, yet he had no power
to approach her nor indeed had he even looked upon the form of
her face. Withal the Mouse ceased not faring about until she
approached the Jew, whom she discovered sleeping upon his back
and drowned in slumber for the excess of his drink that weighed
him down. So she drew near and considered him and saw the
Ring in his mouth below the tongue whereat she was perplext
how to recover it; but presently she went forth to a vessel of oil
and dipping her tail therein approached the sleeper and drew it
over his nostrils, whereat he sneezed with a sneeze so violent that
the Ring sprang from between his jaws and fell upon the side of
the bedstead. Then she seized it in huge joy and returning to the
Cat said to her, “Verily the prosperity of our lord hath returned
to him.” After this the twain went back to the Dog whom
they found expecting them, so they marched down to the sea
and mounted upon his back and he swam with them both, all three
being in the highest spirits. But when they reached the middle
of the main, quoth the Cat to the Mouse, “Pass the Ring to me
that I may carry it awhile;” and the other did so, when she
placed it in her chops for an hour of time. Then quoth the Dog
to them, “Ye twain have taken to yourselves charge of the Ring,
each of you for a little time, and I also would do likewise.”
They both said to him, “O our brother, haply ’twill fall from thy
mouth:” but said he to them, “By Allah, an ye give it not to me
for a while I will drown you both in this very place.” Accordingly
the two did in their fear as the Dog desired and when he had
set it in his chops it dropped therefrom into the abyss of the
ocean; seeing which all repented thereat and they said, “Wasted
is our work we have wrought.” But when they came to land they
found their lord sleeping from the excess of his cark and his care,
and so the trio stood on the shore and were sorrowing with sore
sorrow, when behold, there appeared to them a Fish strange of
semblance who said to them, “Take ye this Signet-ring and
commit it to your lord, the son of the Fisherman, and when giving
it to him say:—Since thou didst a good deed and threwest
the Fish into the sea thy kindness shall not be for naught; and,
if it fail with the Creature, it shall not fail with Allah the Creator.
Then do ye inform him that the Fish which his father the Fisher
would have presented to the King and whereupon he had mercy
and returned her to the waters, that Fish am I, and the old saw
saith, This for that, and tit for tat is its reward!” Hereupon
the Dog took the Signet-ring and the other two went up with
him to their lord and awaking him from sleep returned to him his
Ring. But when he saw it he became like one Jinn-mad from
the excess of his joy and the three related to him the affair of
the Signet; how they had brought it away from the Jew and how
it had dropped from the Dog’s mouth into the abyss of the sea
and lastly how the Fish who had found it brought it back to them
declaring that it was she whom his sire had netted and whom
the son had returned to the depths. Cried he, “Alhamdolillah—Glory
be to the Lord—who caused us work this weal and requited
us for our kindness;” after which he took the Signet and waited
until night had nighted. Then he repaired to the mound which
was under the Sultan’s Palace and brought out the Ring and
rubbed it, when the Slave appeared and cried to him, “Here
I stand (and fair befal thy command!) between thy hands: what
is it needest thou and requirest thou of me?” The other replied,
“I demand that thou carry off for me this mound.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I should relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Son of
the Fisherman bade the Slave of the Ring remove the mound and
return the garden as whilome it was and restore the Palace
containing the Jew and the Sultan’s daughter. Nor did that hour
pass before everything was replaced in its proper stead. Then
the Youth went up to the saloon where he found the Jew recovered
from his drunkenness and he was threatening the Princess and
saying, “Thou! for thee there is no escape from me.” But cried
she, “O dog, O accurst, joy from my lord is well nigh to me.”
Hearing these words the Youth fell upon the Jew and dragging
him along by his neck, went down with him and bade them light
a furious fire, and so they did till it flamed and flared; after which
he pinioned his enemy and caused him to be cast therein when
his bones were melted upon his flesh. Then returning to the
Palace he fell to blaming the Sultan’s daughter for the matter of
the Ring, and asking her, “Why didst thou on this wise?” She
answered, “From Fate there is no flight, and Alhamdolillah—praise
to the Lord—who after all that befel us from the
Jew hath brought us together once more.” Now all that
happened from the Jew and the return of the Sultan’s daughter
and the restoring of the Palace and the death of his deceiver
remained unknown to the Sultan, and here is an end to my
history. And when the second Larrikin held his peace quoth
the King, “Allah quicken thee for this story; by the Almighty
’tis wondrous, and it delighteth the hearer and rejoiceth the
teller.” Then cried the third Larrikin, “I also have by me an
history more marvellous than these two; and, were it written
in water of gold upon the pages of men’s hearts, it were worthy
thereof.” Quoth the King, “O Larrikin, if it prove stranger and
rarer than these I will surely largesse thee.” Whereupon quoth
he, “O King of the Age, listen to what I shall relate,” and he fell
to telling the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>TALE OF THE THIRD LARRIKIN CONCERNING HIMSELF.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">In my early years I had a cousin, the daughter of my paternal
uncle, who loved me and I loved her whilst her father loathed me.
So one day she sent to me saying, “Do thou fare forth and demand
me in marriage from my sire;” and, as I was poor and her father
was a wealthy merchant, she sent me to her dowry fifty gold pieces
which I took; and, accompanied by four of my comrades, I went
to the house of my father’s brother and there arrived I went within.
But when he looked upon me his face showed wrath and my
friends said to him, “Verily, thy nephew seeketh in marriage the
daughter of his uncle;” and as soon as he heard these words he
cried aloud at them and reviled me and drave me from his doors.
So I went from him well nigh broken-hearted and I wept till I
returned to my mother who cried, “What is to do with thee, O my
son!” I related to her all that had befallen me from my uncle
and she said to me, “O my child, to a man who loveth thee not
thou goest, forsooth, to ask his daughter in marriage!” Whereto
I replied, “O mother mine, she sent a message bidding me so do
and verily she loveth me.” Quoth my mother, “Take patience,
O my son!” I heartened my heart, and my parent promised me
all welfare and favour from my cousin; moreover she was thinking
of me at all times and presently she again sent to me and promised
me that she never would love any other. Then behold, a party
of folk repaired to her father and asked her to wife of him and
prepared to take her away. But when the tidings reached her that
her parent purposed marrying her to one of those people, she sent
to me saying, “Get thee ready for this midnight and I will come to
thee.” When night was at its noon she appeared, carrying a pair
of saddle bags wherein was a somewhat of money and raiment,
and she was leading a she-mule belonging to her father whereupon
her saddle-bags were packed. “Up with us,” she cried, so I arose
with her in that outer darkness and we went forth the town forthright
and the Veiler veiled us, nor did we stint faring till morning
when we hid ourselves in fear lest we be overtaken. And when
the next night fell we made ready and set out again, but we knew
not whither we were wending, for the Predestinator existeth and
what is decided for us is like Destiny. At last we came to a wide
and open place where the heat smote us, and we sat down under a
tree to smell the air. Presently sleep came upon me and I was
drowned in slumber from the excess of my toil and travail, when
suddenly a dog-faced baboon came up to the daughter of my
uncle——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I should relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Seventy-first Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Larrikin
continued his tale saying to the King:—And as I was drowned
in slumber a dog-faced baboon came up to the daughter of my
uncle and assaulted her and knew her carnally; then, having
taken her pucelage he ran away,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7061" id="noteref-7061" epub:type="noteref">7061</a> but I knew nothing thereof from
being fast asleep. Now when I awoke I found my cousin was
changed of case and her colour had waxed pale and she was in
saddest condition; so I asked her and she told me all that had
betided her and said to me, “O son of my uncle, from Fate there
is no flight, even as saith one of those who knoweth:——</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And one of them also said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When God would execute His Will in anything On one endowed with sight,   hearing and reasoning,</div>
      <div class="line">He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his will From him, as one   draws out the hairs to paste that cling;</div>
      <div class="line">Till, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back his wit, That therewithal he may   receive admonishing.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7063" id="noteref-7063" epub:type="noteref">7063</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she spake concerning the predestination of the Creator till
she could say no more thereof. Presently we departed that stead
and we travelled till we came to a town of the towns frequented
by merchants, where we hired us a lodging and furnished it
with mats and necessaries. Here I asked for a Kazi and they
pointed out to me one of them amongst the judges of the place
whom I summoned with two of his witnesses; then I made one
of them deputy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7064" id="noteref-7064" epub:type="noteref">7064</a> for my cousin and was married to her and went
in unto her and I said to myself, “All things depend upon Fate
and Lot.” After that I tarried with her for a full told year in that
same town, a disease befel her and she drew nigh unto death.
Hereat quoth she to me, “Allah upon thee, O son of my uncle,
when I shall be dead and gone and the Destiny of Allah shall
come upon thee and drive thee to marry again, take not to wife
any but a virgin-girl or haply do thou wed one who hath known
man but once;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7065" id="noteref-7065" epub:type="noteref">7065</a> for by Allah, O my cousin, I will say thee nothing
but sooth when I tell thee that the delight of that dog-faced
baboon who deflowered me hath remained with me ever since.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7066" id="noteref-7066" epub:type="noteref">7066</a>
So saying she expired<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7067" id="noteref-7067" epub:type="noteref">7067</a> and her soul fled forth her flesh. I
brought to her a woman who washeth the dead and shrouded her
and buried her; and after her decease I went forth from the town
until Time bore me along and I became a wanderer and my condition
was changed and I fell into this case. And no one knew
me or aught of my affairs till I came and made friends with
yonder two men. Now the King hearing these words marvelled
at his adventure and what had betided him from the Shifts of Time
and his heart was softened to him and he largessed him and his
comrades and sent them about their business. Then quoth one of
the bystanders to the King, “O Sultan, I know a tale still rarer
than this;” and quoth the King, “Out with it;” whereat the man
began to relate</p>
