  <h2 id="c1" class="c007">THE EBONY HORSE.<a id="r1"></a><a href="#f1" class="c011"><sup>[1]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once in times of yore and ages long gone before, a
great and puissant King, of the Kings of the Persians, Sábúr by
name, who was the richest of all the Kings in store of wealth and
dominion and surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom. He
was generous, open handed and beneficent, and he gave to those
who sought him and repelled not those who resorted to him; and
he comforted the broken-hearted and honourably entreated those
who fled to him for refuge. Moreover, he loved the poor and was
hospitable to strangers and did the oppressed justice upon the
oppressor. He had three daughters, like full moons of shining
light or flower-gardens blooming bright; and a son as he were the
moon; and it was his wont to keep two festivals in the twelvemonth,
those of the Nau-Roz, or New Year, and Mihrgán the Autumnal
Equinox,<a id="r2"></a><a href="#f2" class="c011"><sup>[2]</sup></a> on which occasions he threw open his palaces and gave
largesse and made proclamation of safety and security and promoted
his chamberlains and viceroys; and the people of his realm
came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the holy
day, bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs. Now he loved
science and geometry, and one festival-day as he sat on his kingly
throne there came in to him three wise men, cunning artificers
and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions, skilled in
making things curious and rare, such as confound the wit; and
versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in mysteries
and subtleties. And they were of three different tongues and
countries, the first a Hindi or Indian,<a id="r3"></a><a href="#f3" class="c011"><sup>[3]</sup></a> the second a Roumi or
Greek and the third a Farsi or Persian. The Indian came
forwards and, prostrating himself before the King, wished him joy
of the festival and laid before him a present befitting his dignity;
that is to say, a man of gold, set with precious gems and jewels
<span class="pageno" id="Page_2">2</span>of price and hending in hand a golden trumpet. When Sabur<a id="r4"></a><a href="#f4" class="c011"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
saw this, he asked, “O sage, what is the virtue of this figure?”;
and the Indian answered, “O my lord, if this figure be set at
the gate of thy city, it will be a guardian over it; for, if an
enemy enter the place, it will blow this clarion against him
and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead.” Much
the King marvelled at this and cried, “By Allah, O sage, an this
thy word be true, I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire.”
Then came forward the Greek and, prostrating himself before the
King, presented him with a basin of silver, in whose midst was
a peacock of gold, surrounded by four-and-twenty chicks of the
same metal. Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek,
said to him, “O sage, what is the virtue of this peacock?” “O
my lord,” answered he, “as often as an hour of the day or night
passeth, it pecketh one of its young and crieth out and flappeth
its wings, till the four-and-twenty hours are accomplished;
and when the month cometh to an end, it will open its mouth
and thou shalt see the crescent therein.” And the King said,
“An thou speak sooth, I will bring thee to thy wish and thy
desire.” Then came forward the Persian sage and, prostrating
himself before the King, presented him with a horse<a id="r5"></a><a href="#f5" class="c011"><sup>[5]</sup></a> of the
blackest ebony-wood inlaid with gold and jewels, and ready
harnessed with saddle, bridle and stirrups such as befit Kings;
which when Sabur saw, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and
was confounded at the beauty of its form and the ingenuity of its
fashion. So he asked, “What is the use of this horse of wood, and
what is its virtue and what the secret of its movement?”; and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>Persian answered, “O my lord, the virtue of this horse is that, if
one mount him, it will carry him whither he will and fare with its
rider through the air and cover the space of a year in a single
day.” The King marvelled and was amazed at these three
wonders, following thus hard upon one another on the same day,
and turning to the sage, said to him, “By Allah the Omnipotent,
and our Lord the Beneficent, who created all creatures and feedeth
them with meat and drink, an thy speech be veritable and the
virtue of thy contrivance appear, I will assuredly give thee whatsoever
thou lustest for and will bring thee to thy desire and thy
wish!”<a id="r6"></a><a href="#f6" class="c011"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Then he entertained the sages three days, that he might
make trial of their gifts; after which they brought the figures
before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and
showed him the mystery of its movement. The trumpeter blew the
trump; the peacock pecked its chicks and the Persian sage mounted
the ebony horse, whereupon it soared with him high in air and
descended again. When King Sabur saw all this, he was amazed
and perplexed and felt like to fly for joy and said to the three
sages, “Now I am certified of the truth of your words and it
behoveth me to quit me of my promise. Ask ye, therefore, what
ye will, and I will give you that same.” Now the report of the
King’s daughters had reached the sages, so they answered, “If the
King be content with us and accept of our gifts and allow us to
prefer a request to him, we crave of him that he give us his three
daughters in marriage, that we may be his sons-in-law; for that the
stability of Kings may not be gainsaid.” Quoth the King, “I grant
you that which you wish and you desire,” and bade summon the
Kazi forthright, that he might marry each of the sages to one of
his daughters. Now it fortuned that the Princesses were behind
a curtain, looking on; and when they heard this, the youngest
considered her husband to be and behold, he was an old man,<a id="r7"></a><a href="#f7" class="c011"><sup>[7]</sup></a> an
hundred years of age, with hair frosted, forehead drooping, eyebrows
mangy, ears slitten, beard and mustachios stained and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>dyed; eyes red and goggle; cheeks bleached and hollow; flabby
nose like a brinjall, or egg-plant<a id="r8"></a><a href="#f8" class="c011"><sup>[8]</sup></a>; face like a cobbler’s apron, teeth
overlapping and lips like camel’s kidneys, loose and pendulous; in
brief a terror, a horror, a monster, for he was of the folk of his time
the unsightliest and of his age the fright-fullest; sundry of his
grinders had been knocked out and his eye-teeth were like the
tusks of the Jinni who frighteneth poultry in hen-houses. Now
the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time, more elegant
than the gazelle however tender, than the gentlest zephyr blander
and brighter than the moon at her full; for amorous fray right
suitable; confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and
outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe; in fine she was fairer
and sweeter by far than all her sisters. So, when she saw her
suitor, she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and
tore her clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and
wailing. Now the Prince, her brother, Kamar al-Akmár, or the
Moon of Moons hight, was then newly returned from a journey
and, hearing her weeping and crying came in to her (for he loved
her with fond affection, more than his other sisters) and asked her,
“What aileth thee? What hath befallen thee? Tell me and
conceal naught from me.” So she smote her breast and answered,
“O my brother and my dear one, I have nothing to hide. If the
palace be straitened upon thy father, I will go out; and if he be
resolved upon a foul thing, I will separate myself from him, though
he consent not to make provision for me; and my Lord will
provide.” Quoth he, “Tell me what meaneth this talk and what
hath straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper.” “O my
brother and my dear one,” answered the Princess, “Know that my
father hath promised me in marriage to a wicked magician who
brought him, as a gift, a horse of black wood, and hath bewitched
him with his craft and his egromancy; but, as for me, I will none
of him, and would, because of him, I had never come into this
world!” Her brother soothed her and solaced her, then fared to
his sire and said, “What be this wizard to whom thou hast given
<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>my youngest sister in marriage, and what is this present which he
hath brought thee, so that thou hast killed<a id="r9"></a><a href="#f9" class="c011"><sup>[9]</sup></a> my sister with chagrin?
It is not right that this should be.” Now the Persian was standing
by and, when he heard the Prince’s words, he was mortified and
filled with fury and the King said, “O my son, an thou sawest
this horse, thy wit would be confounded and thou wouldst be
amated with amazement.” Then he bade the slaves bring the
horse before him and they did so; and, when the Prince saw it, it
pleased him. So (being an accomplished cavalier) he mounted it
forthright and struck its sides with the shovel-shaped stirrup-irons;
but it stirred not and the King said to the Sage, “Go show him its
movement, that he also may help thee to win thy wish.” Now
the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he
should have his sister; so he showed him the pin of ascent on
the right side of the horse and saying to him, “Trill this,” left
him. Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo! the horse
forthwith soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and
gave not overflying till it disappeared from men’s espying, whereat
the King was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to
the Persian, “O sage, look how thou mayst make him descend.”
But he replied, “O my lord, I can do nothing, and thou wilt
never see him again till Resurrection-day, for he, of his ignorance
and pride, asked me not of the pin of descent and I forgot
to acquaint him therewith.” When the King heard this, he was
enraged with sore rage; and bade bastinado the sorcerer and clap
him in jail, whilst he himself cast the crown from his head and beat
his face and smote his breast. Moreover, he shut the doors of
his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and keening, he and
his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city; and thus their
joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into sore
affliction and sadness. Thus far concerning them; but as regards
the Prince, the horse gave not over soaring with him till he drew
near the sun, whereat he gave himself up for lost and saw death
in the skies, and was confounded at his case, repenting him of
having mounted the horse and saying to himself, “Verily, this was
a device of the Sage to destroy me on account of my youngest
sister; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I am lost without recourse; but I
wonder, did not he who made the ascent-pin make also a descent-pin?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>Now he was a man of wit and knowledge and intelligence;
so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse, but saw
nothing save a screw, like a cock’s head, on its right shoulder and
the like on the left, when quoth he to himself, “I see no sign save
these things like buttons.” Presently he turned the right-hand
pin, whereupon the horse flew heavenwards with increased speed.
So he left it and looking at the sinister shoulder and finding
another pin, he wound it up and immediately the steed’s upwards
motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend, little by little,
towards the face of the earth, while the rider became yet more
cautious and careful of his life.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince wound up the sinister screw, the steed’s upward motion
slowed and ceased, and it began to descend, little by little,
towards the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and
careful of his life. And when he saw this and knew the uses of
the horse, his heart was filled with joy and gladness and he thanked
Almighty Allah for that He had deigned deliver him from destruction.
Then he began to turn the horse’s head whithersoever
he would, making it rise and fall at pleasure, till he had gotten
complete mastery over its every movement. He ceased not to
descend the whole of that day, for that the steed’s ascending flight
had borne him afar from the earth; and, as he descended, he
diverted himself with viewing the various cities and countries over
which he passed and which he knew not, never having seen them
in his life. Amongst the rest, he descried a city ordered after the
fairest fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land, rich in
trees and streams, with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains;
whereat he fell a-musing and said to himself, “Would I knew the
name of yon town and in what land it is!” And he took to
circling about it and observing it right and left. By this time, the
day began to decline and the sun drew near to its downing; and
he said in his mind, “Verily I find no goodlier place to night in
than this city; so I will lodge here and early on the morrow I will
return to my kith and kin and my kingdom; and tell my father
and family what hath passed and acquaint him with what mine
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>eyes have seen.” Then he addressed himself to seeking a place
wherein he might safely bestow himself and his horse and where
none should descry him, and presently behold, he espied a-middle-most
of the city a palace rising high in upper air surrounded by a
great wall with lofty crenelles and battlements, guarded by forty
black slaves, clad in complete mail and armed with spears and
swords, bows and arrows. Quoth he, “This is a goodly place,”
and turned the descent-pin, whereupon the horse sank down
with him like a weary bird, and alighted gently on the terrace-roof
of the palace. So the Prince dismounted and ejaculating
“Alhamdolillah”—praise be to Allah<a id="r10"></a><a href="#f10" class="c011"><sup>[10]</sup></a>—he began to go round
about the horse and examine it, saying, “By Allah, he who
fashioned thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman,
and if the Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me
to my country and kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my
father, I will assuredly bestow upon him all manner bounties and
benefit him with the utmost beneficence.” By this time night had
overtaken him and he sat on the roof till he was assured that all
in the palace slept; and indeed hunger and thirst were sore upon
him, for that he had not tasted food nor drunk water since he
parted from his sire. So he said within himself, “Surely the like of
this palace will not lack of victual;” and, leaving the horse above,
went down in search of somewhat to eat. Presently, he came to
a staircase and descending it to the bottom, found himself in a
court paved with white marble and alabaster, which shone in the
light of the moon. He marvelled at the place and the goodliness
of its fashion, but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no living
soul and stood in perplexed surprise, looking right and left and
knowing not whither he should wend. Then said he to himself,
“I may not do better than return to where I left my horse and
pass the night by it; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount
and ride away.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
king’s son to himself, “I may not do better than pass the night
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>by my horse; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and
ride away.” However, as he tarried talking to himself, he espied
a light within the palace, and making towards it, found that it
came from a candle that stood before a door of the Harim, at the
head of a sleeping eunuch, as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon
or a tribesman of the Jinn, longer than lumber and broader than
a bench. He lay before the door, with the pommel of his sword
gleaming in the flame of the candle, and at his head was a bag
of leather<a id="r11"></a><a href="#f11" class="c011"><sup>[11]</sup></a> hanging from a column of granite. When the Prince
saw this, he was affrighted and said, “I crave help from Allah the
Supreme! O mine Holy One, even as Thou hast already delivered
me from destruction, so vouchsafe me strength to quit
myself of the adventure of this palace!” So saying, he put out
his hand to the budget and taking it, carried it aside and opened
it and found in it food of the best. He ate his fill and refreshed
himself and drank water, after which he hung up the provision-bag
in its place and drawing the eunuch’s sword from its sheath,
took it, whilst the slave slept on, knowing not whence destiny
should come to him. Then the Prince fared forwards into the
palace and ceased not till he came to a second door, with a curtain
drawn before it; so he raised the curtain and behold, on entering
he saw a couch of the whitest ivory, inlaid with pearls and jacinths
and jewels, and four slave-girls sleeping about it. He went up to
the couch, to see what was thereon, and found a young lady lying
asleep, chemised with her hair<a id="r12"></a><a href="#f12" class="c011"><sup>[12]</sup></a> as she were the full moon rising<a id="r13"></a><a href="#f13" class="c011"><sup>[13]</sup></a>
over the Eastern horizon, with flower-white brow and shining hair-parting
and cheeks like blood-red anemones and dainty moles
thereon. He was amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and
loveliness, her symmetry and grace, and he recked no more
of death. So he went up to her, trembling in every nerve and,
shuddering with pleasure, kissed her on the right cheek; whereupon
she awoke forthright and opened her eyes, and seeing the
Prince standing at her head, said to him, “Who art thou and
whence comest thou?” Quoth he, “I am thy slave and thy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>lover.” Asked she, “And who brought thee hither?” and he
answered, “My Lord and my fortune.” Then said Shams
al-Nahár<a id="r14"></a><a href="#f14" class="c011"><sup>[14]</sup></a> (for such was her name), “Haply thou art he who
demanded me yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected
thee, pretending that thou wast foul of favour. By Allah, my sire
lied in his throat when he spoke this thing, for thou art not other
than beautiful.” Now the son of the King of Hind had sought
her in marriage, but her father had rejected him, for that he was
ugly and uncouth, and she thought the Prince was he. So, when
she saw his beauty and grace (for indeed he was like the radiant
moon) the syntheism<a id="r15"></a><a href="#f15" class="c011"><sup>[15]</sup></a> of love gat hold of her heart as it were a
flaming fire, and they fell to talk and converse. Suddenly, her
waiting-women awoke and, seeing the Prince with their mistress,
said to her, “Oh my lady, who is this with thee?” Quoth she,
“I know not; I found him sitting by me, when I woke up: haply
‘tis he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire.” Quoth they,
“O my lady, by Allah the All-Father, this is not he who seeketh
thee in marriage, for he is hideous and this man is handsome
and of high degree. Indeed, the other is not fit to be his servant.”<a id="r16"></a><a href="#f16" class="c011"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
Then the handmaidens went out to the eunuch, and finding him
slumbering awoke him, and he started up in alarm. Said they, “How
happeneth it that thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come
in to us, whilst we are asleep?” When the black heard this, he
sprang in haste to his sword, but found it not; and fear took him
and trembling. Then he went in, confounded, to his mistress and
seeing the Prince sitting at talk with her, said to him, “O my lord,
art thou man or Jinni?” Replied the Prince, “Woe to thee, O
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>unluckiest of slaves: how darest thou even the sons of the royal
Chosroes<a id="r17"></a><a href="#f17" class="c011"><sup>[17]</sup></a> with one of the unbelieving Satans?” And he was as
a raging lion. Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the
slave, “I am the King’s son-in-law, and he hath married me to his
daughter and bidden me go in to her.” And when the eunuch
heard these words he replied, “O my lord, if thou be indeed of kind
a man as thou avouchest, she is fit for none but for thee, and thou
art worthier of her than any other.” Thereupon the eunuch ran
to the King, shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving
dust upon his head; and when the King heard his outcry, he said
to him, “What hath befallen thee?: speak quickly and be brief;
for thou hast fluttered my heart.” Answered the eunuch, “O King,
come to thy daughter’s succour; for a devil of the Jinn, in the likeness
of a King’s son, hath got possession of her; so up and at
him!” When the King heard this, he thought to kill him and said,
“How camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this
demon come at her?” Then he betook himself to the Princess’s
palace, where he found her slave-women standing to await him and
asked them, “What is come to my daughter?” “O King,”
answered they, “slumber overcame us and, when we awoke, we
found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk with her, as he
were the full moon; never saw we aught fairer of favour than he.
So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou hadst
given him thy daughter in marriage. More than this we know not,
nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni; but he is modest and
well bred, and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace.”
Now when the King heard these words, his wrath cooled
and he raised the curtain little by little and looking in, saw sitting
at talk with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest with a face like
the full moon for sheen. At this sight he could not contain himself,
of his jealousy for his daughter’s honour; and, putting aside
the curtain, rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a
furious Ghul. Now when the Prince saw him he asked the
Princess, “Is this thy sire?”; and she answered, “Yes.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixtieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince saw the King rushing in upon them, drawn sword in hand,
like a furious Ghul he asked the Princess, “Is this thy sire?”;
and she answered, “Yes.” Whereupon he sprang to his feet and,
seizing his sword, cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that
he was confounded. Then the youth would have fallen on him
with the sword; but the King seeing that the Prince was doughtier
than he, sheathed his scymitar and stood till the young man came
up to him, when he accosted him courteously and said to him, “O
youth, art thou a man or a Jinni?” Quoth the Prince, “Did I not
respect thy right as mine host and thy daughter’s honour, I would
spill thy blood! How darest thou fellow me with devils, me that
am a Prince of the sons of the royal Chosroes who, had they
wished to take thy kingdom, could shake thee like an earthquake
from thy glory and thy dominions and spoil thee of all thy possessions?”
Now when the King heard his words, he was confounded
with awe and bodily fear of him and rejoined, “If thou indeed be
of the sons of the Kings, as thou pretendest, how cometh it that
thou enterest my palace without my permission, and smirchest
mine honour, making thy way to my daughter and feigning that
thou art her husband and claiming that I have given her to thee
to wife, I that have slain Kings and King’s sons, who sought her
of me in marriage? And now who shall save thee from my might
and majesty when, if I cried out to my slaves and servants and
bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths they would slay thee
forthright? Who shall deliver thee out of my hand?” When
the Prince heard this speech of the King he answered, “Verily, I
wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit!
Say me, canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself,
and hast ever seen a stouter hearted man or one better fitted for
a Sultan or a more glorious in rank and dominion than I?”
Rejoined the King, “Nay, by Allah! but I would have had thee,
O youth, act after the custom of Kings and demand her from me
to wife before witnesses, that I might have married her to thee
publicly; and now, even were I to marry her to thee privily, yet
hast thou dishonoured me in her person.” Rejoined the Prince,
“Thou sayest sooth, O King, but if thou summon thy slaves and
thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me, as thou pretendest,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace, and the folk would
be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee. Wherefore,
O King, thou wilt do well, meseemeth, to turn from this thought
to that which I shall counsel thee.” Quoth the King, “Let me
hear what thou hast to advise;” and quoth the Prince, “What I
have to propose to thee is this: either do thou meet me in combat
singular, I and thou; and he who slayeth his adversary shall be
held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom; or
else, let me be this night and, whenas dawns the morn, draw out
against me thy horsemen and footmen and servants; but first tell
me their number.” Said the King, “They are forty thousand
horse, besides my own slaves and their followers,<a id="r18"></a><a href="#f18" class="c011"><sup>[18]</sup></a> who are the like
of them in number.” Thereupon said the Prince, “When the day
shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
the Prince, “When day shall break, do thou array them against me
and say to them:—This man is a suitor to me for my daughter’s
hand, on condition that he shall do battle single-handed against
you all; for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put you
to the rout, and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him. After
which, leave me to do battle with them: if they slay me, then is thy
secret the surer guarded and thine honour the better warded; and
if I overcome them and see their backs, then is it the like of me a
King should covet to his son-in-law.” So the King approved of
his opinion and accepted his proposition, despite his awe at the
boldness of his speech and amaze at the pretensions of the Prince
to meet in fight his whole host, such as he had described it to him,
being at heart assured that he would perish in the fray and so he
should be quit of him and freed from the fear of dishonour. Thereupon
he called the eunuch and bade him go to his Wazir without
stay and delay and command him to assemble the whole of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>army and cause them don their arms and armour and mount their
steeds. So the eunuch carried the King’s order to the Minister,
who straightway summoned the Captains of the host and the
Lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring-do
and mount horse and sally forth in battle array. Such was their
case; but as regards the King, he sat a long while conversing with
the young Prince, being pleased with his wise speech and good
sense and fine breeding. And when it was daybreak he returned
to his palace and, seating himself on his throne, commanded his
merry men to mount and bade them saddle one of the best of the
royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and
bring it to the Prince. But the youth said, “O King, I will not
mount horse, till I come in view of the troops and review them.”
“Be it as thou wilt,” replied the King. Then the two repaired to
the parade-ground, where the troops were drawn up, and the young
Prince looked upon them and noted their great number; after
which the King cried out to them, saying, “Ho, all ye men, there
is come to me a youth who seeketh my daughter in marriage; and
in very sooth never have I seen a goodlier than he; no, nor a
stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm, for he pretendeth that he
can overcome you, single-handed, and force you to flight and that,
were ye an hundred thousand in number, yet for him would ye be
but few. Now when he chargeth down on you, do ye receive him
upon point of pike and sharp of sabre; for, indeed, he hath undertaken
a mighty matter.” Then quoth the King to the Prince,
“Up, O my son, and do thy devoir on them.” Answered he, “O
King, thou dealest not justly and fairly by me: how shall I go
forth against them, seeing that I am afoot and the men be
mounted?” The King retorted, “I bade thee mount, and thou
refusedst; but choose thou which of my horses thou wilt.” Then
he said, “Not one of thy horses pleaseth me, and I will ride none
but that on which I came.” Asked the King, “And where is thy
horse?” “Atop of thy palace.” “In what part of my palace?”
“On the roof.” Now when the King heard these words, he cried,
“Out on thee! this is the first sign thou hast given of madness.
How can the horse be on the roof? But we shall at once see if
thou speak truth or lies.” Then he turned to one of his chief
officers and said to him, “Go to my palace and bring me what
thou findest on the roof.” So all the people marvelled at the
young Prince’s words, saying one to other, “How can a horse
come down the steps from the roof? Verily this is a thing whose
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>like we never heard.” In the mean time the King’s messenger
repaired to the palace and mounting to the roof, found the horse
standing there and never had he looked on a handsomer; but
when he drew near and examined it, he saw that it was made of
ebony and ivory. Now the officer was accompanied by other high
officers, who also looked on and they laughed to one another,
saying, “Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake?
We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see
the truth of his case.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
high officials looked upon the horse, they laughed one to other
and said, “Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake?
We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see
the truth of his case. Peradventure herein is some mighty matter,
and he is a man of high degree.” Then they lifted up the horse
bodily and, carrying it to the King, set it down before him, and
all the lieges flocked round to look at it, marvelling at the beauty
of its proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle. The
King also admired it and wondered at it with extreme wonder;
and he asked the Prince, “O youth, is this thy horse?” He
answered, “Yes, O King, this is my horse, and thou shalt soon see
the marvel it showeth.” Rejoined the King, “Then take and
mount it,” and the Prince retorted, “I will not mount till the
troops withdraw afar from it.” So the King bade them retire a
bowshot from the horse; whereupon quoth its owner, “O King,
see thou; I am about to mount my horse and charge upon thy
host and scatter them right and left and split their hearts asunder.”
Said the King, “Do as thou wilt; and spare not their lives, for
they will not spare thine.” Then the Prince mounted, whilst the
troops ranged themselves in ranks before him, and one said to
another, “When the youth cometh between the ranks, we will take
him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our sabres.”
Quoth another, “By Allah, this is a mere misfortune: how shall
we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form?” And a
third continued, “Ye will have hard work to get the better of him;
for the youth had not done this, but for what he knew of his own
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>prowess and pre-eminence of valour.” Meanwhile, having settled
himself in his saddle, the Prince turned the pin of ascent; whilst
all eyes were strained to see what he would do, whereupon the
horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro and make the
strangest of movements steed ever made, till its belly was filled
with air and it took flight with its rider and soared high into the
sky. When the King saw this, he cried out to his men, saying,
“Woe to you! catch him, catch him, ere he ‘scape you!” But his
Wazirs and Viceroys said to him, “O King, can a man overtake
the flying bird? This is surely none but some mighty magician
or Mar¡d of the Jinn or devil, and Allah save thee from him. So
praise thou the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy
host from his hand.” Then the King returned to his palace
after seeing the feat of the Prince and, going in to his daughter,
acquainted her with what had befallen them both on the parade-ground.
He found her grievously afflicted for the Prince and
bewailing her separation from him; wherefore she fell sick with
violent sickness and took to her pillow. Now when her father
saw her on this wise, he pressed her to his breast and kissing her
between the eyes, said to her, “O my daughter, praise Allah
Almighty and thank Him for that He hath delivered us from this
crafty enchanter, this villain, this low fellow, this thief who thought
only of seducing thee!” And he repeated to her the story of the
Prince and how he had disappeared in the firmament; and he
abused him and cursed him knowing not how dearly his daughter
loved him. But she paid no heed to his words and did but redouble
in her tears and wails, saying to herself, “By Allah, I will
neither eat meat nor drain drink, till Allah reunite me with him!”
Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much
over her plight; but, for all he could do to soothe her, love-longing
only increased on her.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King
mourned much over his daughter’s plight but, for all he could do
to soothe her, love-longing only increased on her. Thus far concerning
the King and Princess Shams al-Nahár; but as regards
Prince Kamar al-Akmar, when he had risen high in air, he turned
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>his horse’s head towards his native land, and being alone mused
upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness. Now he had
enquired of the King’s people the name of the city and of its King
and his daughter; and men had told him that it was the city of
Sana’á.<a id="r19"></a><a href="#f19" class="c011"><sup>[19]</sup></a> So he journeyed with all speed, till he drew near his
father’s capital and, making an airy circuit about the city, alighted
on the roof of the King’s palace, where he left his horse, whilst he
descended into the palace and seeing its threshold strewn with
ashes, thought that one of his family was dead. Then he entered,
as of wont, and found his father and mother and sisters clad in
mourning raiment of black, all pale of faces and lean of frames.
When his sire descried him and was assured that it was indeed his
son, he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fit, but after
a time coming to himself, threw himself upon him and embraced
him, clipping him to his bosom and rejoicing in him with exceeding
joy and extreme gladness. His mother and sisters heard this; so
they came in and seeing the Prince, fell upon him, kissing him and
weeping, and joying with exceeding joyance. Then they questioned
him of his case; so he told them all that had past from first to
last, and his father said to him, “Praised be Allah for thy safety,
O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart!” Then the King bade
hold high festival, and the glad tidings flew through the city. So
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of mourning,
they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets
and markets; whilst the folk vied with one another who should be
the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a general
pardon and opening the prisons, released those who were therein
prisoned. Moreover, he made banquets for the people, with great
abundance of eating and drinking, for seven days and nights and
all creatures were gladsomest; and he took horse with his son
and rode out with him, that the folk might see him and rejoice.
After awhile the Prince asked about the maker of the horse,
saying, “O my father, what hath fortune done with him?”; and
the King answered, “Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein
I set eyes on him! For he was the cause of thy separation from
us, O my son, and he hath lain in gaol since the day of thy disappearance.”
Then the King bade release him from prison and,
sending for him, invested him in a dress of satisfaction and entreated
him with the utmost favour and munificence, save that he would
not give him his daughter to wife; whereat the Sage raged with
sore rage and repented of that which he had done, knowing that
the Prince had secured the secret of the steed and the manner of
its motion. Moreover, the King said to his son, “I reck thou wilt
do well not to go near the horse henceforth and more especially
not to mount it after this day; for thou knowest not its properties,
and belike thou art in error about it.” Now the Prince had told his
father of his adventure with the King of Sana’a and his daughter
and he said, “Had the King intended to kill thee, he had done so;
but thine hour was not yet come.” When the rejoicings were at
an end, the people returned to their places and the King and his
son to the palace, where they sat down and fell to eating and
drinking and making merry. Now the King had a handsome
handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute; so she took it
and began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King
and his son of separation of lovers, and she chanted the following
verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness; ✿ What should remember I did you fro’ my remembrance wane?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>When the Prince heard these verses, the fires of longing flamed
up in his heart and pine and passion redoubled upon him. Grief
and regret were sore upon him and his bowels yearned in him for
love of the King’s daughter of Sana’a; so he rose forthright and,
escaping his father’s notice, went forth the palace to the horse
and mounting it, turned the pin of ascent, whereupon birdlike
it flew with him high in air and soared towards the upper regions
of the sky. In early morning his father missed him and, going
up to the pinnacle of the palace, in great concern, saw his son
rising into the firmament; whereat he was sore afflicted and repented
in all penitence that he had not taken the horse and
hidden it; and he said to himself, “By Allah, if but my son
return to me, I will destroy the horse, that my heart may be at
rest concerning my son.” And he fell again to weeping and bewailing
himself——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that the King
again fell to weeping and bewailing himself for his son. Such was
his case; but as regards the Prince, he ceased not flying on through
air till he came to the city of Sana’a and alighted on the roof as
before. Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the eunuch
asleep, as of wont, raised the curtain and went on little by little, till
he came to the door of the Princess’s alcove<a id="r21"></a><a href="#f21" class="c011"><sup>[21]</sup></a>-chamber and stopped
to listen; when lo! he heard her shedding plenteous tears and
reciting verses, whilst her women slept round her. Presently, overhearing
her weeping and wailing quoth they, “O our mistress, why
wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee?” Quoth she,
“O ye little of wit, is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or
who are forgotten?” And she fell again to wailing and weeping,
till sleep overcame her. Hereat the Prince’s heart melted for her
and his gall-bladder was like to burst, so he entered and, seeing
her lying asleep without covering,<a id="r22"></a><a href="#f22" class="c011"><sup>[22]</sup></a> touched her with his hand;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>whereupon she opened her eyes and espied him standing by her.
Said he, “Why all this crying and mourning?” And when she
knew him, she threw herself upon him, and took him around the
neck and kissed him and answered, “For thy sake and because of
my separation from thee.” Said he, “O my lady, I have been
made desolate by thee all this long time!” But she replied, “‘Tis
thou who hast desolated <em>me</em>; and hadst thou tarried longer, I had
surely died!” Rejoined he, “O my lady, what thinkest thou of
my case with thy father and how he dealt with me? Were it not
for my love of thee, O temptation and seduction of the Three
Worlds, I had certainly slain him and made him a warning to all
beholders; but, even as I love thee, so I love him for thy sake.”
Quoth she, “How couldst thou leave me: can my life be sweet to
me after thee?” Quoth he, “Let what hath happened suffice:
I am now hungry, and thirsty.” So she bade her maidens make
ready meat and drink, and they sat eating and drinking and conversing
till night was well nigh ended; and when day broke he
rose to take leave of her and depart, ere the eunuch should
awake. Shams al-Nahar asked him, “Whither goest thou?”; and
he answered, “To my father’s house, and I plight thee my troth
that I will come to thee once in every week.” But she wept and
said, “I conjure thee, by Allah the Almighty, take me with thee
whereso thou wendest and make me not taste anew the bitter-gourd<a id="r23"></a><a href="#f23" class="c011"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
of separation from thee.” Quoth he, “Wilt thou indeed go
with me?” and quoth she, “Yes.” “Then,” said he, “arise that
we depart.” So she rose forthright and going to a chest, arrayed
herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her trinkets of
gold and jewels of price, and she fared forth her handmaids
recking naught. So he carried her up to the roof of the palace
and, mounting the ebony horse, took her up behind him and made
her fast to himself, binding her with strong bonds; after which he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>turned the shoulder-pin of ascent, and the horse rose with him
high in air. When her slave-women saw this, they shrieked aloud
and told her father and mother, who in hot haste ran to the palace-roof
and looking up, saw the magical horse flying away with the
Prince and Princess. At this the King was troubled with ever-increasing
trouble and cried out, saying, “O King’s son, I conjure
thee, by Allah, have ruth on me and my wife and bereave us not
of our daughter!” The Prince made him no reply; but, thinking
in himself that the maiden repented of leaving father and mother,
asked her, “O ravishment of the age, say me, wilt thou that I
restore thee to thy mother and father?”: whereupon she answered,
“By Allah, O my lord, that is not my desire: my only wish is to
be with thee, wherever thou art; for I am distracted by the love
of thee from all else, even from my father and mother.” Hearing
these words the Prince joyed with great joy, and made the horse
fly and fare softly with them, so as not to disquiet her; nor did
they stay their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow,
wherein was a spring of running water. Here they alighted and
ate and drank; after which the Prince took horse again and set her
behind him, binding her in his fear for her safety; after which they
fared on till they came in sight of his father’s capital. At this,
the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to show his
beloved the seat of his dominion and his father’s power and dignity
and give her to know that it was greater than that of her sire.
So he set her down in one of his father’s gardens without the city
where his parent was wont to take his pleasure; and, carrying her
into a domed summer-house prepared there for the King, left the
ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over
it, saying, “Sit here, till my messenger come to thee; for I go
now to my father, to make ready a palace for thee and show thee
my royal estate.” She was delighted when she heard these words
and said to him, “Do as thou wilt;”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the maiden
was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, “Do as
thou wilt;” for she thereby understood that she should not enter
the city but with due honour and worship, as became her rank.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the
King his father, who rejoiced in his return and met him and
welcomed him; and the Prince said to him, “Know that I have
brought with me the King’s daughter of whom I told thee; and
have left her without the city in such a garden and come to tell
thee, that thou mayst make ready the procession of estate and go
forth to meet her and show her thy royal dignity and troops and
guards.” Answered the King, “With joy and gladness”; and
straightway bade decorate the town with the goodliest adornment.
Then he took horse and rode out in all magnificence and majesty,
he and his host, high officers and household, with drums and
kettledrums, fifes and clarions and all manner instruments; whilst
the Prince drew forth of his treasuries jewellery and apparel and
what else of the things which Kings hoard and made a rare display
of wealth and splendour: moreover he got ready for the Princess
a canopied litter of brocades, green, red and yellow, wherein
he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave-girls. Then he left
the litter and those who were therein and preceded them to the pavilion
where he had set her down; and searched but found naught,
neither Princess nor horse. When he saw this, he beat his face
and rent his raiment and began to wander round about the garden,
as he had lost his wits; after which he came to his senses and said
to himself, “How could she have come at the secret of this horse,
seeing I told her nothing of it? Maybe the Persian sage who
made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her away, in
revenge for my father’s treatment of him.” Then he sought the
guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass
the precincts; and said, “Hath any one come in here? Tell me
the truth and the whole truth or I will at once strike off your
heads.” They were terrified by his threats; but they answered
with one voice, “We have seen no man enter save the Persian sage,
who came to gather healing herbs.” So the Prince was certified
that it was indeed he that had taken away the maiden——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince heard their answer, he was certified that the Sage had taken
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>away the maiden and abode confounded and perplexed concerning
his case. And he was abashed before the folk and, turning to his
sire, told him what had happened and said to him, “Take the
troops and march them back to the city. As for me, I will never
return till I have cleared up this affair.” When the King heard
this, he wept and beat his breast and said to him, “O my son, calm
thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home with us and
look what King’s daughter thou wouldst fain have, that I may
marry thee to her.” But the Prince paid no heed to his words and
farewelling him departed, whilst the King returned to the city and
their joy was changed into sore annoy. Now, as Destiny issued her
decree, when the Prince left the Princess in the garden-house and
betook himself to his father’s palace, for the ordering of his affair,
the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and, scenting
the sweet savour of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the
Princess and impregnated the whole place, followed it till he came
to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had
made with his own hands. His heart was filled with joy and gladness,
for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of
his hand: so he went up to it and, examining its every part, found it
whole and sound; whereupon he was about to mount and ride away,
when he bethought himself and said, “Needs must I first look
what the Prince hath brought and left here with the horse.” So
he entered the pavilion and, seeing the Princess sitting there, as
she were the sun shining sheen in the sky serene, knew her at the
first glance to be some high-born lady and doubted not but the
Prince had brought her thither on the horse and left her in the
pavilion, whilst he went to the city, to make ready for her entry
in state procession with all splendour. Then he went up to her
and kissed the earth between her hands, whereupon she raised her
eyes to him and, finding him exceedingly foul of face and favour,
asked, “Who art thou?”; and he answered, “O my lady, I am a
messenger sent by the Prince who hath bidden me bring thee to
another pleasance nearer the city; for that my lady the Queen
cannot walk so far and is unwilling, of her joy in thee, that
another should forestall her with thee.” Quoth she, “Where is
the Prince?”; and quoth the Persian, “He is in the city, with his
sire and forthwith he shall come for thee in great state.” Said she,
“O thou! say me, could he find none handsomer to send to me?”;
whereat loud laughed the Sage and said, “Yea verily, he hath not
a Mameluke as ugly as I am; but, O my lady, let not the ill-favour
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>of my face and the foulness of my form deceive thee.
Hadst thou profited of me as hath the Prince, verily thou wouldst
praise my affair. Indeed, he chose me as his messenger to thee,
because of my uncomeliness and loathsomeness in his jealous
love of thee: else hath he Mamelukes and negro slaves, pages,
eunuchs and attendants out of number, each goodlier than
other.” Whenas she heard this, it commended itself to her
reason and she believed him; so she rose forthright——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Persian sage acquainted the Princess with the case of the King’s
son, she believed him; so she rose forthright; and, putting her
hand in his, said, “O my father, what hast thou brought me to
ride?” He replied, “O my lady, thou shalt ride the horse thou
camest on;” and she, “I cannot ride it by myself.” Whereupon
he smiled and knew that he was her master and said, “I will ride
with thee myself.” So he mounted and, taking her up behind him
bound her to himself with firm bonds, while she knew not what he
would with her. Then he turned the ascent-pin, whereupon the
belly of the horse became full of wind and it swayed to and fro like
a wave of the sea, and rose with them high in air nor slackened
in its flight, till it was out of sight of the city. Now when Shams
al-Nahar saw this, she asked him, “Ho thou! what is become of
that thou toldest me of my Prince, making me believe that he
sent thee to me?” Answered the Persian, “Allah damn the Prince!
he is a mean and skin-flint knave.” She cried, “Woe to thee!
How darest thou disobey thy lord’s commandment?” Whereto the
Persian replied, “He is no lord of mine: knowest thou who I
am?” Rejoined the Princess, “I know nothing of thee save what
thou toldest me;” and retorted he, “What I told thee was a trick
of mine against thee and the King’s son: I have long lamented
the loss of this horse which is under us; for I constructed it and
made myself master of it. But now I have gotten firm hold of it and
of thee too, and I will burn his heart even as he hath burnt mine;
nor shall he ever have the horse again; no, never! So be of good
cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for I can be of more
<span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>use to thee than he; and I am generous as I am wealthy; my
servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress; I will robe
thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy will.”
When she heard this, she buffeted her face and cried out, saying,
“Ah, well-away! I have not won my beloved and I have lost
my father and mother!” And she wept bitter tears over what
had befallen her, whilst the Sage fared on with her, without
ceasing, till he came to the land of the Greeks<a id="r24"></a><a href="#f24" class="c011"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and alighted in
a verdant mead, abounding in streams and trees. Now this
meadow lay near a city wherein was a King of high puissance,
and it chanced that he went forth that day to hunt and divert
himself. As he passed by the meadow, he saw the Persian
standing there, with the damsel and the horse by his side; and,
before the Sage was ware, the King’s slaves fell upon him and
carried him and the lady and the horse to their master who,
noting the foulness of the man’s favour and his loathsomeness
and the beauty of the girl and her loveliness, said, “O my lady,
what kin is this oldster to thee?” The Persian made haste to
reply, saying, “She is my wife and the daughter of my father’s
brother.” But the lady at once gave him the lie and said, “O
King, by Allah, I know him not, nor is he my husband; nay, he
is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by force and
fraud.” Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian and
they beat him till he was well-nigh dead; after which the King
commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail; and,
taking from him the damsel and the ebony horse (though he
knew not its properties nor the secret of its motion), set the girl
in his serraglio and the horse amongst his hoards. Such was the
case with the Sage and the lady; but as regards Prince Kamar
al-Akmar, he garbed himself in travelling gear and taking what
he needed of money, set out tracking their trail in very sorry
plight; and journeyed from country to country and city to city
seeking the Princess and enquiring after the ebony horse, whilst all
who heard him marvelled at him and deemed his talk extravagant.
Thus he continued doing a long while; but, for all his enquiry and
quest, he could hit on no news of her. At last he came to her
father’s city of Sana’a and there asked for her, but could get no
tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss. So he
turned back and made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>enquire concerning the twain as he went——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King’s
son made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning
the two as he went along, till, as chance would have it, he
alighted at a certain Khan and saw a company of merchants
sitting at talk. So he sat down near them and heard one say, “O
my friends, I lately witnessed a wonder of wonders.” They asked,
“What was that?” and he answered, “I was visiting such a district
in such a city (naming the city wherein was the Princess),
and I heard its people chatting of a strange thing which had
lately befallen. It was that their King went out one day hunting
and coursing with a company of his courtiers and the lords of his
realm; and, issuing from the city, they came to a green meadow
where they espied an old man standing, with a woman sitting hard
by a horse of ebony. The man was foulest-foul of face and loathly
of form, but the woman was a marvel of beauty and loveliness and
elegance and perfect grace; and as for the wooden horse, it was a
miracle, never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor more gracious
than its make.” Asked the others, “And what did the King
with them?”; and the merchant answered, “As for the man the
King seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended
that she was his wife and the daughter of his paternal
uncle; but she gave him the lie forthright and declared that he
was a sorcerer and a villain. So the King took her from the old
man and bade beat him and cast him into the trunk-house. As
for the ebony horse, I know not what became of it.” When the
Prince heard these words, he drew near to the merchant and began
questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name of
the city and of its King; which when he knew, he passed the
night full of joy. And as soon as dawned the day he set out and
travelled sans surcease till he reached that city; but, when he
would have entered, the gatekeepers laid hands on him, that they
might bring him before the King to question him of his condition
and the craft in which he skilled and the cause of his coming
thither—such being the usage and custom of their ruler. Now
it was supper-time when he entered the city, and it was then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>impossible to go in to the King or take counsel with him respecting
the stranger. So the guards carried him to the jail, thinking
to lay him by the heels there for the night; but, when the warders
saw his beauty and loveliness, they could not find it in their hearts
to imprison him: they made him sit with them without the walls;
and, when food came to them, he ate with them what sufficed him.
As soon as they had made an end of eating, they turned to the
Prince and said, “What countryman art thou?” “I come from
Fars,” answered he, “the land of the Chosroës.” When they
heard this they laughed and one of them said, “O Chosroan,<a id="r25"></a><a href="#f25" class="c011"><sup>[25]</sup></a> I
have heard the talk of men and their histories and I have looked
into their conditions; but never saw I or heard I a bigger liar
than the Chosroan which is with us in the jail.” Quoth another,
“And never did I see aught fouler than his favour or more hideous
than his visnomy.” Asked the Prince, “What have ye seen of his
lying?”; and they answered, “He pretendeth that he is one of the
wise! Now the King came upon him, as he went a-hunting, and
found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the
blackest ebony, never saw I a handsomer. As for the damsel, she
is with the King, who is enamoured of her and would fain marry
her; but she is mad, and were this man a leach as he claimeth to
be, he would have healed her, for the King doth his utmost to
discover a cure for her case and a remedy for her disease, and this
whole year past hath he spent treasures upon physicians and
astrologers, on her account; but none can avail to cure her. As
for the horse, it is in the royal hoard-house, and the ugly man
is here with us in prison; and as soon as night falleth, he weepeth
and bemoaneth himself and will not let us sleep.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>held in prison and his weeping and wailing, the Prince at once
devised a device whereby he might compass his desire; and presently
the guards of the gate, being minded to sleep, led him into
the jail and locked the door. So he overheard the Persian weeping
and bemoaning himself, in his own tongue, and saying, “Alack, and
alas for my sin, that I sinned against myself and against the King’s
son, in that which I did with the damsel; for I neither left her nor
won my will of her! All this cometh of my lack of sense, in that
I sought for myself that which I deserved not and which befitted
not the like of me; for whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all,
falleth with the like of my fall.” Now when the King’s son heard
this, he accosted him in Persian, saying, “How long will this weeping
and wailing last? Say me, thinkest thou that hath befallen thee
that which never befel other than thou?” Now when the Persian
heard this, he made friends with him and began to complain to
him of his case and misfortunes. And as soon as the morning
morrowed, the warders took the Prince and carried him before their
King, informing him that he had entered the city on the previous
night, at a time when audience was impossible. Quoth the King
to the Prince, “Whence comest thou and what is thy name and
trade and why hast thou travelled hither?” He replied, “As to
my name I am called in Persian Harjah;<a id="r26"></a><a href="#f26" class="c011"><sup>[26]</sup></a> as to my country I come
from the land of Fars; and I am of the men of art and especially
of the art of medicine and healing the sick and those whom the
Jinns drive mad. For this I go round about all countries and
cities, to profit by adding knowledge to my knowledge, and whenever
I see a patient I heal him and this is my craft.”<a id="r27"></a><a href="#f27" class="c011"><sup>[27]</sup></a> Now when
the King heard this, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, “O
excellent Sage, thou hast indeed come to us at a time when we
need thee.” Then he acquainted him with the case of the Princess,
adding, “If thou cure her and recover her from her madness, thou
shalt have of me everything thou seekest.” Replied the Prince,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>“Allah save and favour the King: describe to me all thou hast
seen of her insanity and tell me how long it is since the access
attacked her; also how thou camest by her and the horse and the
Sage.” So the King told him the whole story, from first to last,
adding, “The Sage is in gaol<a id="t28"></a>.” Quoth the Prince, “O auspicious
King, and what hast thou done with the horse?” Quoth the King,
“O youth, it is with me yet, laid up in one of my treasure-chambers,”
whereupon said the Prince within himself, “The best thing I
can do is first to see the horse and assure myself of its condition.
If it be whole and sound, all will be well and end well; but, if its
motor-works be destroyed, I must find some other way of delivering
my beloved.” Thereupon he turned to the King and said to
him, “O King, I must see the horse in question: haply I may find
in it somewhat that will serve me for the recovery of the damsel.”
“With all my heart,” replied the King, and taking him by the
hand, showed him into the place where the horse was. The Prince
went round about it, examining its condition, and found it whole
and sound, whereat he rejoiced greatly and said to the King,
“Allah save and exalt the King! I would fain go in to the
damsel, that I may see how it is with her; for I hope in Allah to
heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse.” Then
he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to
the Princess’s apartment, where her lover found her wringing her
hands and writhing and beating herself against the ground, and
tearing her garments to tatters as was her wont; but there was no
madness of Jinn in her, and she did this but that none might
approach her. When the Prince saw her thus, he said to her, “No
harm shall betide thee, O ravishment of the three worlds;” and
went on to soothe her and speak her fair, till he managed to
whisper, “I am Kamar al-Akmar;” whereupon she cried out with
a loud cry and fell down fainting for excess of joy; but the King
thought this was epilepsy<a id="r28"></a><a href="#f28" class="c011"><sup>[28]</sup></a> brought on by her fear of him, and by
her suddenly being startled. Then the Prince put his mouth to
her ear and said to her, “O Shams al-Nahar, O seduction of the
universe, have a care for thy life and mine and be patient and
constant; for this our position needeth sufferance and skilful contrivance
to make shift for our delivery from this tyrannical King.
My first move will be now to go out to him and tell him that thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy madness; but that I will
engage to heal thee and drive away the evil spirit, if he will at once
unbind thy bonds. So when he cometh in to thee, do thou speak
him smooth words, that he may think I have cured thee, and all
will be done for us as we desire.” Quoth she, “Hearkening and
obedience;” and he went out to the King in joy and gladness,
and said to him, “O august King, I have, by thy good fortune,
discovered her disease and its remedy, and have cured her for
thee. So now do thou go in to her and speak her softly and treat
her kindly, and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou
desirest of her be accomplished to thee.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince feigned himself a leach and went in to the damsel and
made himself known to her and told her how he purposed to
deliver her, she cried “Hearkening and obedience!” He then fared
forth from her and sought the King and said, “Go thou in to her
and speak her softly and promise her what may please her; so
shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee.” Thereupon
the King went in to her and when she saw him, she rose and
kissing the ground before him, bade him welcome and said, “I
admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day;”
whereat he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting-women
and the eunuchs attend her and carry her to the Hammam and
make ready for her dresses and adornment. So they went in to
her and saluted her, and she returned their salams with the goodliest
language and after the pleasantest fashion; whereupon they clad
her in royal apparel and, clasping a collar of jewels about her neck,
carried her to the bath and served her there. Then they brought
her forth, as she were the full moon; and, when she came into
the King’s presence, she saluted him and kissed ground before him;
whereupon he joyed in her with joy exceeding and said to the
Prince, “O Sage, O philosopher, all this is of thy blessing. Allah
increase to us the benefit of thy healing breath!”<a id="r29"></a><a href="#f29" class="c011"><sup>[29]</sup></a> The Prince
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>replied, “O King, for the completion of her cure it behoveth that
thou go forth, thou and all thy troops and guards, to the place
where thou foundest her, not forgetting the beast of black wood
which was with her; for therein is a devil; and, unless I exorcise
him, he will return to her and afflict her at the head of every
month.” “With love and gladness,” cried the King, “O thou Prince
of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of
day.” Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in
question and rode thither with all his troops and the Princess, little
weeting the purpose of the Prince. Now when they came to the
appointed place, the Prince, still habited as a leach, bade them set
the Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King
and his troops, and said to him, “With thy leave, and at thy word,
I will now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations, and here
imprison the adversary of mankind, that he may never more return
to her. After this, I shall mount this wooden horse which seemeth
to be made of ebony, and take the damsel up behind me; whereupon
it will shake and sway to and fro and fare forwards, till it
come to thee, when the affair will be at an end; and after this thou
mayst do with her as thou wilt.” When the King heard his words,
he rejoiced with extreme joy; so the Prince mounted the horse,
and, taking the damsel up behind him, whilst the King and his
troops watched him, bound her fast to him. Then he turned the
ascending-pin and the horse took flight and soared with them
high in air, till they disappeared from every eye. After this the
King abode half the day, expecting their return; but they returned
not. So when he despaired of them, repenting him greatly of that
which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the damsel, he
went back to the city with his troops. He then sent for the Persian
who was in prison and said to him, “O thou traitor, O thou villain,
why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse?
And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off,
together with a slave-girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of
money, and I shall never see anyone or anything of them again!”
So the Persian related to him all his past, first and last, and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>King was seized with a fit of fury which well-nigh ended his life.
He shut himself up in his palace for a while, mourning and
afflicted; but at last his Wazirs came in to him and applied themselves
to comfort him, saying, “Verily, he who took the damsel is
an enchanter, and praised be Allah who hath delivered thee from
his craft and sorcery!” And they ceased not from him, till he
was comforted for her loss. Thus far concerning the King; but as
for the Prince, he continued his career towards his father’s capital
in joy and cheer, and stayed not till he alighted on his own palace,
where he set the lady in safety; after which he went in to his
father and mother and saluted them and acquainted them with her
coming, whereat they were filled with solace and gladness. Then
he spread great banquets for the towns-folk——And Shahrazad

But his father brake the ebony horse in pieces and destroyed its
mechanism for flight; moreover the Prince wrote a letter to the
Princess’s father, advising him of all that had befallen her and
informing him how she was now married to him and in all health

presents and curious rarities. And when the messenger arrived at
the city which was Sana’a and delivered the letter and the presents
to the King, he read the missive and rejoiced greatly thereat and
accepted the presents, honouring and rewarding the bearer handsomely.
Moreover, he forwarded rich gifts to his son-in-law by
the same messenger, who returned to his master and acquainted
him with what had passed; whereat he was much cheered. And
after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his father-in-law
and sent him presents till, in course of time, his sire King Sabur
deceased and he reigned in his stead, ruling justly over his lieges
and conducting himself well and righteously towards them, so that
the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal service;
and Kamar al-Akmar and his wife Shams al-Nahar abode in the
enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life, till there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and Sunderer of societies; the
Plunderer of palaces, the Caterer for cemeteries and the Garnerer
of graves. And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not
and in whose hand is the dominion of the worlds visible and invisible!

writers Sana’a was founded by Shem son of Noah who, wandering southward with his
posterity after his father’s death, and finding the site delightful, dug a well and founded
the citadel, Ghamdán, which afterwards contained a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison Carrée</span></i> rivalling (or attempting
to rival) the Meccan Ka’abah. The builder was Surahbíl who, says M. C. de Perceval
coloured its four faces red, white, golden and green; the central quadrangle had seven
stories (the planets) each forty cubits high, and the lowest was a marble hall ceiling’d with
a single slab. At the four corners stood hollow lions through whose mouths the winds
roared. This palatial citadel-temple was destroyed by order of Caliph Omar. The
city’s ancient name was Azal or Uzal whom some identify with one of the thirteen sons
of Joktan (Genesis xi. 27): it took its present name from the Ethiopian conquerors
(they say) who, seeing it for the first time, cried “Hazá Sana’ah!” meaning in their
tongue, this is commodious, etc. I may note that the word is Kisawahili (Zanzibarian)
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> “Yámbo <em>sáná</em>—is the state <em>good</em>?” Sana’a was the capital of the Tabábi’ah or
Tobba Kings who judaized; and the Abyssinians with their Negush made it Christian
while the Persians under Anushirwán converted it to Guebrism. It is now easily visited
but to little purpose; excursions in the neighbourhood being deadly dangerous. Moreover
the Turkish garrison would probably murder a stranger who sympathised with the
Arabs, and the Arabs kill one who took part with their hated and hateful conquerors.
The late Mr. Shapira of Jerusalem declared that he had visited it and Jews have great
advantages in such travel. But his friends doubted him.</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone
before, a King of great power and lord of glory and dominion
galore; who had a Wazir Ibrahim hight, and this Wazir’s daughter
was a damsel of extraordinary beauty and loveliness, gifted with
passing brilliancy and the perfection of grace, possessed of abundant
wit, and in all good breeding complete. But she loved
wassail and wine and the human face divine and choice verses
and rare stories; and the delicacy of her inner gifts invited all
hearts to love, even as saith the poet, describing her:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Like moon she shines amid the starry sky, ✿ Robing in tresses blackest ink outvie.</div>
      <div class="line">The morning-breezes give her boughs fair drink, ✿ And like a branch she sways with supple ply:</div>
      <div class="line">She smiles in passing us. O thou that art ✿ Fairest in yellow robed, or cramoisie,</div>
      <div class="line">Thou playest with my wit in love, as though ✿ Sparrow in hand of playful boy were I.<a id="r31"></a><a href="#f31" class="c011"><sup>[31]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Her name was Rose-in-Hood and she was so named for her young
and tender beauty and the freshness of her brilliancy; and the
King loved her in his cups because of her accomplishments and
fine manners. Now it was the King’s custom yearly to gather
together all the nobles of his realm and play with the ball.<a id="r32"></a><a href="#f32" class="c011"><sup>[32]</sup></a> So
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>when the day came round whereon the folk assembled for ball-play,
the Minister’s daughter seated herself at her lattice, to divert
herself by looking on at the game; and, as they were at play, her
glance fell upon a youth among the guards than whom never was
seen a comelier face nor a goodlier form; for he was bright of
favour showing white teeth when he smiled, tall-statured and
broad-shouldered. She looked at him again and again and could
not take her fill of gazing; and presently said to her nurse, “What
is the name of yonder handsome young man among the troops?”
Replied the nurse, “O my daughter, the dear fellows are all
handsome. Which of them dost thou mean?” Said Rose-in-Hood,
“Wait till he come past and I will point him out to thee.”
So she took an apple and as he rode by dropped it on him, whereupon
he raised his head, to see who did this, and espied the Wazir’s
daughter at the window, as she were the moon of fullest light in
the darkness of the night; nor did he withdraw his eyes, till his
heart was utterly lost to her, and he recited these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Was’t archer shot me, or was’t thine eyes ✿ Ruined lover’s heart that thy charms espies?</div>
      <div class="line">Was the notchèd shaft<a id="r33"></a><a href="#f33" class="c011"><sup>[33]</sup></a> from a host outshot, ✿ Or from latticed window in sudden guise?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the game was at an end, and all had left the ground, she
asked her nurse, “What is the name of that youth I showed
thee?”; and the good woman answered, “His name is Uns al-Wujud;”
whereat Rose-in-Hood shook her head and lay down on
her couch, with thoughts a-fire for love. Then, sighing deeply,
she improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He missed not who dubbed thee, “World’s delight,” ✿ A world’s love conjoining to bounty’s light:<a id="r34"></a><a href="#f34" class="c011"><sup>[34]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">O thou, whose favour the full moon favours, ✿ Whose charms make life and the living bright!</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast none equal amongst mankind; ✿ Sultan of Beauty, and proof I’ll cite:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>Thine eyebrows are likest a well-formed Nún,<a id="r35"></a><a href="#f35" class="c011"><sup>[35]</sup></a> ✿ And thine eyes a Sád,<a id="r36"></a><a href="#f36" class="c011"><sup>[36]</sup></a> by His hand indite;</div>
      <div class="line">Thy shape is the soft, green bough that gives ✿ When asked to all with all-gracious sprite:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou excellest knights of the world in stowre, ✿ With delight and beauty and bounty dight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she had finished her verses, she wrote them on a sheet of
paper, which she folded in a piece of gold-embroidered silk and
placed under her pillow. Now one of her nurses had seen her; so
she came up to her and held her in talk till she slept, when she
stole the scroll from under her pillow; and, after reading it, knew
that she had fallen in love with Uns al-Wujud. Then she returned
the scroll to its place and when her mistress awoke, she
said to her, “O my lady, indeed I am to thee a true counsellor and
am tenderly anxious on thy account. Know that love is a tyrant
and the hiding it melteth iron and entaileth sickness and unease;
nor for whoso confesseth it is there aught of reproach.” Rejoined
Rose-in-Hood, “And what is the medicine of passion, O nurse
mine?” Answered the nurse, “The medicine of passion is enjoyment.”
Quoth she, “And how may one come by enjoyment?”
Quoth the other, “By letters and messages, my lady; by whispered
words of compliment and by greetings before the world;<a id="r37"></a><a href="#f37" class="c011"><sup>[37]</sup></a> all this
bringeth lovers together and makes hard matters easy. So if thou
have aught at heart, mistress mine, I am the fittest to keep thy
secret and do thy desires and carry thy letters.” Now when the
damsel heard this, her reason flew and fled for joy; but she restrained
herself from speech till she should see the issue of the
matter, saying within herself, “None knoweth this thing of me,
nor will I trust this one with my secret, till I have tried her.”
Then said the woman, “O my lady, I saw in my sleep as though
a man came to me and said:—Thy mistress and Uns al-Wujud
love each other; so do thou serve their case by carrying their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>messages and doing their desires and keeping their secrets; and
much good shall befal thee. So now I have told thee my vision
and it is thine to decide.” Quoth Rose-in-Hood, after she heard
of the dream,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that Rose-in-Hood
asked her nurse after hearing of the dream, “Tell me, canst thou
keep a secret, O my nurse?”; whereto she answered, “And how
should I not keep secrecy, I that am of the flower of the free?”<a id="r38"></a><a href="#f38" class="c011"><sup>[38]</sup></a>
Then the maiden pulled out the scroll, whereon she had written the
verses and said, “Carry me this my letter to Uns al-Wujud and
bring me his reply.” The nurse took the letter and, repairing to
Uns al-Wujud, kissed his hands and greeted him right courteously,
then gave him the paper; and he read it and, comprehending the
contents, wrote on the back these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I soothe my heart and my love repel; ✿ But my state interprets my love too well:</div>
      <div class="line">When tears flow I tell them mine eyes are ill, ✿ Lest the censor see and my case foretell,</div>
      <div class="line">I was fancy-free and unknew I Love; ✿ But I fell in love and in madness fell.</div>
      <div class="line">I show you my case and complain of pain, ✿ Pine and ecstasy that your ruth compel:</div>
      <div class="line">I write you with tears of eyes, so belike ✿ They explain the love come my heart to quell;</div>
      <div class="line">Allah guard a face that is veiled with charms, ✿ Whose thrall is Moon and the Stars as well:</div>
      <div class="line">In her beauty I never beheld the like; ✿ From her sway the branches learn sway and swell:</div>
      <div class="line">I beg you, an ‘tis not too much of pains, ✿ To call;<a id="r39"></a><a href="#f39" class="c011"><sup>[39]</sup></a> ‘twere boon without parallel.</div>
      <div class="line">I give you a soul you will haply take. ✿ To which Union is Heaven, Disunion Hell.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he folded the letter and kissing it, gave it to the go-between
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>and said to her, “O nurse, incline thy lady’s heart to me.” “To
hear is to obey,” answered she and carried the script to her
mistress, who kissed it and laid it on her head, then she opened
it and read it and understood it and wrote at the foot of it these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O whose heart by our beauty is captive ta’en, ✿ Have patience and all thou shalt haply gain!</div>
      <div class="line">When we knew that thy love was a true affect, ✿ And what pained our heart to thy heart gave pain,</div>
      <div class="line">We had granted thee wished-for call and more; ✿ But hindered so doing the chamberlain.</div>
      <div class="line">When the night grows dark, through our love’s excess ✿ Fire burns our vitals with might and main:</div>
      <div class="line">And sleep from our beds is driven afar, ✿ And our bodies are tortured by passion-bane.</div>
      <div class="line">“Hide Love!” in Love’s code is the first command; ✿ And from raising his veil thy hand restrain:</div>
      <div class="line">I fell love-fulfillèd by yon gazelle: ✿ Would he never wander from where I dwell!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she folded the letter and gave it to the nurse, who took it
and went out from her mistress to seek the young man; but, as
she would fare forth, the chamberlain met her and said to her,
“Whither away?” “To the bath,” answered she; but in her fear
and confusion, she dropped the letter, without knowing it, and went
off unrecking what she had done; when one of the eunuchs,
seeing it lying in the way, picked it up. When the nurse came
without the door, she sought for it, but found it not, so turned back
to her mistress and told her of this and what had befallen her.
Meanwhile, the Wazir came out of the Harim and seated himself
on his couch; whereupon behold, the eunuch, who had picked up
the letter, came in to him, hending it in hand and said, “O my
lord, I found this paper lying upon the floor and picked it up.” So
the Minister took it from his hand, folded as it was, and opening
it, read the verses as above set down. Then, after mastering the
meaning, he examined the writing and knew it for his daughter’s
hand; whereupon he went to her mother, weeping so abundant
tears that his beard was wetted. His wife asked him, “What
maketh thee weep, O my lord?”; and he answered, “Take this
letter and see what is therein.” So she took it and found it to be
a love-letter from her daughter Rose-in-Hood to Uns al-Wujud:
whereupon the ready drops sprang to her eyes; but she composed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>her mind, and, gulping down her tears, said to her husband, “O
my lord, there is no profit in weeping: the right course is to cast
about for a means of keeping thine honour and concealing the
affair of thy daughter.” And she went on to comfort him and
lighten his trouble; but he said, “I am fearful for my daughter by
reason of this new passion. Knowest thou not that the Sultan
loveth Uns al-Wujud with exceeding love? And my fear hath
two causes. The first concerneth myself; it is, that she is my
daughter: the second is on account of the King; for that Uns
al-Wujud is a favourite with the Sultan and peradventure great
troubles shall come out of this affair. What deemest thou should
be done?”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir,
after recounting the affair of his daughter, asked his wife, “What
deemest thou should be done?” And she answered, “Have
patience whilst I pray the prayer for right direction.” So she
prayed a two-bow prayer according to the prophetic<a id="r40"></a><a href="#f40" class="c011"><sup>[40]</sup></a> ordinance
for seeking divine guidance; after which she said to her husband,
“In the midst of the Sea of Treasures<a id="r41"></a><a href="#f41" class="c011"><sup>[41]</sup></a> standeth a mountain named
the Mount of the Bereaved Mother (the cause of which being so
called shall presently follow in its place, Inshallah!); and thither
can none have access, save with pains and difficulty and distress:
do thou make that same her abiding-place.” Accordingly the
Minister and his wife agreed to build on that mountain a virgin
castle and lodge their daughter therein with the necessary provision
to be renewed year by year and attendants to cheer and to
serve her. Accordingly he collected carpenters, builders and architects,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>and despatched them to the mountain, where they builded
her an impregnable castle, never saw eyes the like thereof. Then
he made ready vivers and carriage for the journey and, going in to
his daughter by night, bade her prepare to set out on a pleasure-excursion.
Thereupon her heart presaged the sorrows of separation
and, when she went forth and saw the preparations for the journey,
she wept with sore weeping and wrote that upon the door which
might acquaint her lover with what had passed and with the transports
of passion and grief that were upon her, transports such as
would make the flesh to shiver and hair to stare, and melt the
hardest stone with care, and tear from every eye a tear. And
what she wrote were these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By Allah, O thou house, if my beloved a morn go by, ✿ And greet with signs and signals lover e’er is wont to fly,</div>
      <div class="line">I pray thee give him our salams in pure and fragrant guise, ✿ For he indeed may never know where we this eve shall lie.</div>
      <div class="line">I wot not whither they have fared, thus bearing us afar ✿ At speed, and lightly-quipt, the lighter from one love to fly:</div>
      <div class="line">When starkens night, the birds in brake or branches snugly perched ✿ Wail for our sorrow and announce our hapless destiny:</div>
      <div class="line">The tongue of their condition saith, “Alas, alas for woe, ✿ And heavy brunt of parting-blow two lovers must aby”:</div>
      <div class="line">When viewed I separation-cups were fillèd to the brim ✿ And us with merest sorrow-wine Fate came so fast to ply,</div>
      <div class="line">I mixed them with becoming share of patience self to excuse, ✿ But Patience for the loss of you her solace doth refuse.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when she ended her lines, she mounted and they set forward
with her crossing and cutting over wold and wild and riant dale
and rugged hill, till they came to the shore of the Sea of Treasures
here they pitched their tents and built her a great ship, wherein
they went down with her and her suite and carried them over to
the mountain. The Minister had ordered them, on reaching the
journey’s end, to set her in the castle and to make their way back
to the shore, where they were to break up the vessel. So they did
his bidding and returned home, weeping over what had befallen.
Such was their case; but as regards Uns al-Wujud, he arose from
sleep and prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he took horse and
rode forth to attend upon the Sultan. On his way, he passed by
the Wazir’s house, thinking perchance to see some of his followers
as of wont; but he saw no one and, looking upon the door, he
read written thereon the verses aforesaid. At this sight, his senses
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>failed him; fire was kindled in his vitals and he returned to his
lodging, where he passed the day in trouble and transports of grief,
without finding ease or patience, till night darkened upon him, when
his yearning and love-longing redoubled. Thereupon, by way of
concealment, he disguised himself in the ragged garb of a Fakir,<a id="r42"></a><a href="#f42" class="c011"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
and set out wandering at random through the glooms of night,
distracted and knowing not whither he went. So he wandered on
all that night and next day, till the heat of the sun waxed fierce
and the mountains flamed like fire and thirst was grievous upon
him. Presently, he espied a tree, by whose side was a thin thread
of running water; so he made towards it and sitting down in the
shade, on the bank of the rivulet, essayed to drink, but found that
the water had no taste in his mouth;<a id="r43"></a><a href="#f43" class="c011"><sup>[43]</sup></a> and, indeed his colour had
changed and his face had yellowed, and his feet were swollen with
travel and travail. So he shed copious tears and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The lover is drunken with love of friend; ✿ On a longing that groweth his joys depend:</div>
      <div class="line">Love-distracted, ardent, bewildered, lost ✿ From home, nor may food aught of pleasure lend:</div>
      <div class="line">How can life be delightsome to one in love, ✿ And from lover parted, ‘twere strange, unkenned!</div>
      <div class="line">I melt with the fire of my pine for them, ✿ And the tears down my cheek in a stream descend.</div>
      <div class="line">Shall I see them, say me, or one that comes ✿ From the camp, who th’ afflicted heart shall tend?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And after thus reciting he wept till he wetted the hard dry ground;
but anon without loss of time he rose and fared on again over
waste and wold, till there came out upon him a lion, with a neck
buried in tangled mane, a head the bigness of a dome, a mouth
wider than the door thereof and teeth like elephants’ tusks. Now
when Uns al-Wujud saw him, he gave himself up for lost and,
turning<a id="r44"></a><a href="#f44" class="c011"><sup>[44]</sup></a> towards the Temple of Meccah, pronounced the professions
of the faith and prepared for death. He had read in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>books that whoso will flatter the lion, beguileth him,<a id="r45"></a><a href="#f45" class="c011"><sup>[45]</sup></a> for that he
is readily duped by smooth speech and gentled by being glorified;
so he began and said, “O Lion of the forest! O Lord of the waste!
O terrible Leo! O father of fighters! O Sultan of wild beasts!
Behold, I am a lover in longing, whom passion and severance have
been wronging; since I parted from my dear, I have lost my
reasoning gear; wherefore, to my speech do thou give ear and
have ruth on my passion and hope and fear.” When the lion
heard this, he drew back from him and sitting down on his hind-quarters,
raised his head to him and began to frisk tail and paws;
which when Uns al-Wujud saw, he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Lion of the wold wilt thou murther me, ✿ Ere I meet her who doomed me to slavery?</div>
      <div class="line">I am not game and I bear no fat; ✿ For the loss of my love makes me sickness dree;</div>
      <div class="line">And estrangement from her hath so worn me down ✿ I am like a shape in a shroud we see.</div>
      <div class="line">O thou sire of spoils,<a id="r46"></a><a href="#f46" class="c011"><sup>[46]</sup></a> O thou lion of war, ✿ Give not my pains to the blamer’s gree.</div>
      <div class="line">I burn with love, I am drowned in tears ✿ For a parting from lover, sore misery!</div>
      <div class="line">And my thoughts of her in the murk of night ✿ For love hath made my being unbe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">As he had finished his lines the lion rose——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as Uns
al-Wujud ended his lines, the lion arose and stalked slowly up to
him, with eyes tear-railing and licked him with his tongue, then
walked on before him, signing to him as though saying, “Follow
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>me.” So he followed him, and the beast ceased not leading him
on for a while till he brought him up a mountain, and guided him
to the farther side, where he came upon the track of a caravan
over the desert, and knew it to be that of Rose-in-Hood and her
company. Then he took the trail and, when the lion saw that he
knew the track for that of the party which escorted her, he turned
back and went his way; whilst Uns al-Wujud walked along the
foot-marks day and night, till they brought him to a dashing sea,
swollen with clashing surge. The trail led down to the sandy
shore and there broke off; whereby he knew that they had
taken ship and had continued their journey by water. So he
lost hope of finding his lover and with hot tears he repeated
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Far is the fane and patience faileth me; ✿ How can I seek them<a id="r47"></a><a href="#f47" class="c011"><sup>[47]</sup></a> o’er the abysmal sea;</div>
      <div class="line">Or how be patient, when my vitals burn ✿ For love of them, and sleep waxed insomny?</div>
      <div class="line">Since the sad day they left the home and fled, ✿ My heart’s consumèd by love’s ardency:</div>
      <div class="line">Sayhun, Jayhun,<a id="r48"></a><a href="#f48" class="c011"><sup>[48]</sup></a> Euphrates-like my tears, ✿ Make flood no deluged rain its like can see:</div>
      <div class="line">Mine eyelids chafed with running tears remain, ✿ My heart from fiery sparks is never free;</div>
      <div class="line">The hosts of love and longing pressèd me ✿ And made the hosts of patience break and flee.</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve risked my life too freely for their love; ✿ And risk of life the least of ills shall be.</div>
      <div class="line">Allah ne’er punish eye that saw those charms ✿ Enshrined, and passing full moon’s brillancy!</div>
      <div class="line">I found me felled by fair wide-opened eyes, ✿ Which pierced my heart with stringless archery:</div>
      <div class="line">And soft, lithe, swaying shape enraptured me ✿ As sway the branches of the willow-tree:</div>
      <div class="line">Wi’ them I covet union that I win, ✿ O’er love-pains cark and care, a mastery.</div>
      <div class="line">For love of them aye, morn and eve I pine, ✿ And doubt all came to me from evil eyne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when his lines were ended he wept, till he swooned away, and
abode in his swoon a long while; but as soon as he came to himself,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>he looked right and left and seeing no one in the desert, he
became fearful of the wild beasts; so he clomb to the top of a high
mountain, where he heard the voice of a son of Adam speaking
within a cave. He listened and lo! they were the accents of a
devotee, who had forsworn the world and given himself up to pious
works and worship. He knocked thrice at the cavern-door, but
the hermit made him no answer, neither came forth to him; wherefore
he groaned aloud and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">What pathway find I my desire t’obtain, ✿ How ‘scape from care and cark and pain and bane?</div>
      <div class="line">All terrors join to make me old and hoar ✿ Of head and heart, ere youth from me is ta’en:</div>
      <div class="line">Nor find I any aid my passion, nor ✿ A friend to lighten load of bane and pain.</div>
      <div class="line">How great and many troubles I’ve endured! ✿ Fortune hath turned her back I see unfain.</div>
      <div class="line">Ah mercy, mercy on the lover’s heart, ✿ Doomed cup of parting and desertion drain!</div>
      <div class="line">A fire is in his heart, his vitals waste, ✿ And severance made his reason vainest vain.</div>
      <div class="line">How dread the day I came to her abode ✿ And saw the writ they wrote on doorway lain!</div>
      <div class="line">I wept, till gave I earth to drink my grief; ✿ But still to near and far<a id="r49"></a><a href="#f49" class="c011"><sup>[49]</sup></a> I did but feign:</div>
      <div class="line">Then strayed I till in waste a lion sprang ✿ On me, and but for flattering words had slain:</div>
      <div class="line">I soothed him: so he spared me and lent me aid, ✿ He too might haply of love’s taste complain.</div>
      <div class="line">O devotee, that idlest in thy cave, ✿ Meseems eke thou hast learned Love’s might and main;</div>
      <div class="line">But if, at end of woes, with them I league, ✿ Straight I’ll forget all suffering and fatigue.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hardly had he made an end of these verses when, behold! the
door of the cavern opened and he heard one say, “Alas, the pity
of it!”<a id="r50"></a><a href="#f50" class="c011"><sup>[50]</sup></a> So he entered and saluted the devotee, who returned his
salam and asked him, “What is thy name?” Answered the young
man, “Uns al-Wujud.” “And what caused thee to come hither?”
quoth the hermit. So he told him his story in its entirety,
omitting naught of his misfortunes; whereat he wept and said,</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>“O Uns al-Wujud, these twenty years have I passed in this place,
but never beheld I any man here, until yesterday, when I heard
a noise of weeping and lamentation and, looking forth in the
direction of the sound, saw many people and tents pitched on
the sea-shore; and the party at once proceeded to build a ship, in
which certain of them embarked and sailed over the waters. Then
some of the crew returned with the ship and breaking it up, went
their way; and I suspect that those who embarked in the ship and
returned not, are they whom thou seekest. In that case, O Uns
al-Wujud, thy grief must needs be great and sore and thou art
excusable, though never yet was lover but suffered love-longing.”
Then he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Uns al-Wujud, dost deem me fancy-free, ✿ When pine and longing slay and quicken me?</div>
      <div class="line">I have known love and yearning from the years ✿ Since mother-milk I drank, nor e’er was free.</div>
      <div class="line">Long struggled I with Love, till learnt his might; ✿ Ask thou of him, he’ll tell with willing gree.</div>
      <div class="line">Love-sick and pining drank I passion-cup, ✿ And well-nigh perished in mine agony.</div>
      <div class="line">Strong was I, but my strength to weakness turned, ✿ And eye-sword brake through Patience armoury:</div>
      <div class="line">Hope not to win love-joys, without annoy; ✿ Contrary ever links with contrary.</div>
      <div class="line">But fear not change from lover true; be true ✿ Unto thy wish, some day thine own ‘twill be.</div>
      <div class="line">Love hath forbidden to his votaries ✿ Relinquishment as deadliest heresy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The eremite, having ended his verse, rose and, coming up to
Uns al-Wujud, embraced him,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the eremite,
having ended his verse, rose and coming up to Uns al-Wujud
embraced him, and they wept together, till the hills rang with
their cries and they fell down fainting. When they revived, they
swore brotherhood<a id="r51"></a><a href="#f51" class="c011"><sup>[51]</sup></a> in Allah Almighty; after which said Uns al-Wujud,
“This very night will I pray to God and seek of Him direction<a id="r52"></a><a href="#f52" class="c011"><sup>[52]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>anent what thou shouldst do to attain thy desire.” Thus it
was with them; but as regards Rose-in-Hood, when they brought
her to the mountain and set her in the castle and she beheld its
ordering, she wept and exclaimed, “By Allah, thou art a goodly
place, save that thou lackest in thee the presence of the beloved!”<a id="r53"></a><a href="#f53" class="c011"><sup>[53]</sup></a>
Then seeing birds in the island, she bade her people set snares
for them and put all they caught in cages within the castle; and
they did so. But she sat at a lattice and bethought her of what
had passed, and desire and passion and distraction redoubled upon
her, till she burst into tears and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O to whom now, of my desire complaining sore, shall I ✿ Bewail my parting from my fere compellèd thus to fly?</div>
      <div class="line">Flames rage within what underlies my ribs, yet hide them I ✿ In deepest secret dreading aye the jealous hostile spy:</div>
      <div class="line">I am grown as lean, attenuate as any pick of tooth,<a id="r54"></a><a href="#f54" class="c011"><sup>[54]</sup></a> ✿ By sore estrangement, absence, ardour, ceaseless sob and sigh.</div>
      <div class="line">Where is the eye of my beloved to see how I’m become ✿ Like tree stripped bare of leafage left to linger and to die.</div>
      <div class="line">They tyrannisèd over me whom they confined in place ✿ Whereto the lover of my heart may never draw him nigh:</div>
      <div class="line">I beg the Sun for me to give greetings a thousandfold, ✿ At time of rising and again when setting from the sky,</div>
      <div class="line">To the belovèd one who shames a full moon’s loveliness, ✿ When shows that slender form that doth the willow-branch outvie.</div>
      <div class="line">If Rose herself would even with his cheek, I say of her ✿ “Thou art not like it if to me my portion thou deny:”<a id="r55"></a><a href="#f55" class="c011"><sup>[55]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>His honey-dew of lips is like the grateful water draught ✿ Would cool me when a fire in heart upflameth fierce and high:</div>
      <div class="line">How shall I give him up who is my heart and soul of me, ✿ My malady my wasting cause, my love, sole leach of me?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, as the glooms of night closed around her, her yearning
increased and she called to mind the past and recited also these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">‘Tis dark: my transport and unease now gather might and main, ✿ And love-desire provoketh me to wake my wonted pain:</div>
      <div class="line">The pang of parting takes for ever place within my breast, ✿ And pining makes me desolate in destitution lain.</div>
      <div class="line">Ecstasy sore maltreats my soul and yearning burns my sprite, ✿ And tears betray love’s secresy which I would lief contain:</div>
      <div class="line">I weet no way, I know no case that can make light my load, ✿ Or heal my wasting body or cast out from me this bane.</div>
      <div class="line">A hell of fire is in my heart upflames with lambent tongue ✿ And Lazá’s furnace-fires within my liver place have ta’en.</div>
      <div class="line">O thou, exaggerating blame for what befel, enough ✿ I bear with patience whatsoe’er hath writ for me the Pen!</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Meanwhile, the hermit said to Uns al-Wujud, “Go down to the
palm-grove in the valley and fetch some fibre.”<a id="r56"></a><a href="#f56" class="c011"><sup>[56]</sup></a> So he went and
returned with the palm-fibre, which the hermit took and, twisting
into ropes, made therewith a net,<a id="r57"></a><a href="#f57" class="c011"><sup>[57]</sup></a> such as is used for carrying
straw; after which he said, “O Uns al-Wujud, in the heart of the
valley groweth a gourd, which springeth up and drieth upon its
roots. Go down there and fill this sack therewith; then tie it
together and, casting it into the water, embark thereon and make
for the midst of the sea, so haply thou shalt win thy wish; for
whoso never ventureth shall not have what he seeketh.” “I hear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>and obey,” answered Uns al-Wujud. Then he bade the hermit
farewell after the holy man had prayed for him; and, betaking
himself to the sole of the valley, did as his adviser had counselled
him; made the sack, launched it upon the water, and pushed from
shore. Then there arose a wind, which drave him out to sea, till
he was lost to the eremite’s view; and he ceased not to float over
the abysses of the ocean, one billow tossing him up and another
bearing him down (and he beholding the while the dangers and
marvels of the deep), for the space of three days. At the end of
that time Fate cast him upon the Mount of the Bereft Mother,
where he landed, giddy and tottering like a chick unfledged, and
at the last of his strength for hunger and thirst; but, finding there
streams flowing and birds on the branches cooing and fruit-laden
trees in clusters and singly growing, he ate of the fruits and drank
of the rills. Then he walked on till he saw some white thing afar
off, and making for it, found that it was a strongly fortified castle.
So he went up to the gate and seeing it locked, sat down by it;
and there he sat for three days when behold, the gate opened and
an eunuch came out, who finding Uns al-Wujud there seated, said
to him, “Whence camest thou and who brought thee hither?”
Quoth he, “From Ispahan and I was voyaging with merchandise
when my ship was wrecked and the waves cast me upon the farther
side of this island.” Whereupon the eunuch wept and embraced
him, saying, “Allah preserve thee, O thou friendly face! Ispahan
is mine own country and I have there a cousin, the daughter of my
father’s brother, whom I loved from my childhood and cherished
with fond affection; but a people stronger than we fell upon us in
foray and taking me among other booty, cut off my yard<a id="r58"></a><a href="#f58" class="c011"><sup>[58]</sup></a> and sold
me for a castrato, whilst I was yet a lad; and this is how I came to
be in such case.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the eunuch
who came forth from the castle, where Rose-in-Hood was confined,
told Uns al-Wujud all his tale and said:—“The raiders who
captured me cut off my yard and sold me for a castrato; and this
is how I came to be in such case.”<a id="r59"></a><a href="#f59" class="c011"><sup>[59]</sup></a> And after saluting him and
wishing him long life, the eunuch carried him into the courtyard of
the castle, where he saw a great tank of water, surrounded by trees,
on whose branches hung cages of silver, with doors of gold, and
therein birds were warbling and singing the praises of the Requiting
King. And when he came to the first cage he looked in
and lo! a turtle dove, on seeing him, raised her voice and cried
out, saying, “O Thou Bounty-fraught!” Whereat he fell down
fainting and after coming to himself, he sighed heavily and recited
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O turtle dove, like me art thou distraught? ✿ Then pray the Lord and sing “O Bounty-fraught!”</div>
      <div class="line">Would I knew an thy moan were sign of joy, ✿ Or cry of love-desire in heart inwrought,—</div>
      <div class="line">An moan thou pining for a lover gone ✿ Who left thee woe begone to pine in thought,—</div>
      <div class="line">Or if like me hast lost thy fondest friend, ✿ And severance long desire to memory brought?</div>
      <div class="line">O Allah, guard a faithful lover’s lot ✿ I will not leave her though my bones go rot!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, after ending his verses, he fainted again; and, presently
reviving he went on to the second cage, wherein he found a ringdove.
When it saw him, it sang out, “O Eternal, I thank thee!”
and he groaned and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I heard a ringdove chanting plaintively, ✿ “I thank Thee, O Eternal for this misery!”</div>
      <div class="line">Haply, perchance, may Allah, of His grace, ✿ Send me by this long round my love to see.</div>
      <div class="line">Full oft<a id="r60"></a><a href="#f60" class="c011"><sup>[60]</sup></a> she comes with honeyed lips dark red, ✿ And heaps up lowe upon love’s ardency.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>Quoth I (while longing fires flame high and fierce ✿ In heart, and wasting life’s vitality,</div>
      <div class="line">And tears like gouts of blood go railing down ✿ In torrents over cheeks now pale of blee),</div>
      <div class="line">“None e’er trod earth that was not born to woe, ✿ But I will patient dree mine agony,</div>
      <div class="line">So help me Allah! till that happy day ✿ When with my mistress I unite shall be:</div>
      <div class="line">Then will I spend my good on lover-wights, ✿ Who’re of my tribe and of the faith of me;</div>
      <div class="line">And loose the very birds from jail set free, ✿ And change my grief for gladdest gree and glee!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he went on to the third cage, wherein he found a mocking-bird<a id="r61"></a><a href="#f61" class="c011"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
which, when it saw him, set up a song, and he recited the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Pleaseth me yon Hazár of mocking strain ✿ Like voice of lover pained by love in vain.</div>
      <div class="line">Woe’s me for lovers! Ah how many men ✿ By nights and pine and passion low are lain!</div>
      <div class="line">As though by stress of love they had been made ✿ Morn-less and sleep-less by their pain and bane.</div>
      <div class="line">When I went daft for him who conquered me ✿ And pined for him who proved of proudest strain,</div>
      <div class="line">My tears in streams down trickled and I cried ✿ “These long-linkt tears bind like an adamant-chain:”</div>
      <div class="line">Grew concupiscence, severance long, and I ✿ Lost Patience’ hoards and grief waxed sovereign:</div>
      <div class="line">If Justice bide in world and me unite ✿ With him I love and Allah veil us deign,</div>
      <div class="line">I’ll strip my clothes that he my form shall sight ✿ With parting, distance, grief, how poor of plight!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he went to the fourth cage, where he found a Bulbul<a id="r62"></a><a href="#f62" class="c011"><sup>[62]</sup></a> which,
at sight of him, began to sway to and fro and sing its plaintive
descant; and when he heard its complaint, he burst into tears and
repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The Bulbul’s note, whenas dawn is nigh, ✿ Tells the lover from strains of strings to fly:</div>
      <div class="line">Complaineth for passion Uns al-Wujud, ✿ For pine that would being to him deny.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>How many a strain do we hear, whose sound ✿ Softens stones and the rock can mollify:</div>
      <div class="line">And the breeze of morning that sweetly speaks ✿ Of meadows in flowerèd greenery.</div>
      <div class="line">And scents and sounds in the morning-tide ✿ Of birds and zephyrs in fragrance vie;</div>
      <div class="line">But I think of one, of an absent friend, ✿ And tears rail like rain from a showery sky;</div>
      <div class="line">And the flamy tongues in my breast uprise ✿ As sparks from gleed that in dark air fly.</div>
      <div class="line">Allah deign vouchsafe to a lover distraught ✿ Someday the face of his dear to descry!</div>
      <div class="line">For lovers, indeed, no excuse is clear, ✿ Save excuse of sight and excuse of eye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he walked on a little and came to a goodly cage, than which
was no goodlier there, and in it a culver of the forest, that is to say,
a wood-pigeon,<a id="r63"></a><a href="#f63" class="c011"><sup>[63]</sup></a> the bird renowned among birds as the minstrel of
love-longing, with a collar of jewels about its neck marvellous fine
and fair. He considered it awhile and, seeing it absently brooding
in its cage, he shed tears and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O culver of copse,<a id="r64"></a><a href="#f64" class="c011"><sup>[64]</sup></a> with salams I greet; ✿ O brother of lovers who woe must weet!</div>
      <div class="line">I love a gazelle who is slender-slim, ✿ Whose glances for keenness the scymitar beat:</div>
      <div class="line">For her love are my heart and my vitals a-fire, ✿ And my frame consumes in love’s fever-heat.</div>
      <div class="line">The sweet taste of food is unlawful for me, ✿ And forbidden is slumber, unlawfullest sweet.</div>
      <div class="line">Endurance and solace have travelled from me, ✿ And love homes in my heart and grief takes firm seat:</div>
      <div class="line">How shall life deal joy when they flee my sight ✿ Who are joy and gladness and life and sprite?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">As soon as Uns al-Wujud had ended his verse——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as
Uns al-Wujud had ended his verse, the wood-culver awoke from
its brooding and cooed a reply to his lines and shrilled and trilled
with its thrilling notes till it all but spake with human speech;<a id="r65"></a><a href="#f65" class="c011"><sup>[65]</sup></a>
and the tongue of the case talked for it and recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O lover, thou bringest to thought a tide ✿ When the strength of my youth first faded and died;</div>
      <div class="line">And a friend of whose form I was ‘namourèd, ✿ Seductive and dight with beauty’s pride;</div>
      <div class="line">Whose voice, as he sat on the sandhill-tree, ✿ From the Nay’s<a id="r66"></a><a href="#f66" class="c011"><sup>[66]</sup></a> sweet sound turned my heart aside;</div>
      <div class="line">A fowler snared him in net, the while ✿ “O that man would leave me at large!” he cried:</div>
      <div class="line">I had hoped he might somewhat of mercy show ✿ When a hapless lover he so espied;</div>
      <div class="line">But Allah smite him who tore me away, ✿ In his hardness of heart, from my lover’s side;</div>
      <div class="line">But aye my desire for him groweth more, ✿ And my heart with the fires of disjunction is fried:</div>
      <div class="line">Allah guard a true lover, who strives with love, ✿ And hath borne the torments I still abide!</div>
      <div class="line">And, seeing me bound in this cage, with mind ✿ Of ruth, release me my love to find.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Uns al-Wujud turned to his companion, the Ispahahi, and
said, “What palace is this? Who built it and who abideth in it?”
Quoth the eunuch, “The Wazir of a certain King built it to guard
his daughter, fearing for her the accidents of Time and the incidents
of Fortune, and lodged her herein, her and her attendants; nor do
we open it save once in every year, when their provision cometh to
them.” And Uns al-Wujud said to himself, “I have gained my
end, though I may have long to wait.” Such was his case; but as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>regards Rose-in-Hood, of a truth she took no pleasure in eating or
drinking, sitting or sleeping; but her desire and passion and distraction
redoubled on her, and she went wandering about the
castle-corners, but could find no issue; wherefore she shed tears and
recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">They have cruelly ta’en me from him, my beloved, ✿ And made me taste anguish in prison ta’en:</div>
      <div class="line">They have fired my heart with the flames of love, ✿ Barred all sight of him whom to see I’m fain:</div>
      <div class="line">In a lofty palace they prisoned me ✿ On a mountain placed in the middle main.</div>
      <div class="line">If they’d have me forget him, right vain’s their wish, ✿ For my love is grown of a stronger strain.</div>
      <div class="line">How <em>can</em> I forget him whose face was cause ✿ Of all I suffer, of all I ‘plain?</div>
      <div class="line">The whole of my days in sorrow’s spent, ✿ And in thought of him through the night I’m lain.</div>
      <div class="line">Remembrance of him cheers my solitude, ✿ While I lorn of his presence and lone remain.</div>
      <div class="line">Would I knew if, after this all, my fate ✿ To oblige the desire of my heart will deign.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When her verses were ended, she ascended to the terrace-roof of
the castle after donning her richest clothes and trinkets and
throwing a necklace of jewels around her neck. Then binding
together some dresses of Ba’albak<a id="r67"></a><a href="#f67" class="c011"><sup>[67]</sup></a> stuff by way of rope, she tied
them to the crenelles and let herself down thereby to the ground.
And she fared on over wastes and waterless wilds, till she came to
the shore, where she saw a fisherman plying here and there over the
sea, for the wind had driven him on to the island. When he saw
her, he was affrighted<a id="r68"></a><a href="#f68" class="c011"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and pushed off again, flying from her; but
she cried out and made pressing signs to him to return, versifying
with these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O fisherman no care hast thou to fear, ✿ I’m but an earth-born maid in mortal sphere;</div>
      <div class="line">I pray thee linger and my prayer grant ✿ And to my true unhappy tale give ear:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>Pity (so Allah spare thee!) warmest love; ✿ Say, hast thou seen him—my beloved fere?</div>
      <div class="line">I love a lovely youth whose face excels ✿ Sunlight, and passes moon when clearest clear:</div>
      <div class="line">The fawn, that sees his glance, is fain to cry ✿ “I am his thrall” and own himself no peer:</div>
      <div class="line">Beauty hath written, on his winsome cheek, ✿ Rare lines of pregnant sense for every seer;</div>
      <div class="line">Who sights the light of love his soul is saved; ✿ Who strays is Infidel to Hell anear:</div>
      <div class="line">An thou in mercy show his sight, O rare!<a id="r69"></a><a href="#f69" class="c011"><sup>[69]</sup></a> ✿ Thou shalt have every wish, the dearest dear,</div>
      <div class="line">Of rubies and what likest are to them ✿ Fresh pearls and unions new, the sea-shell’s tear:</div>
      <div class="line">My friend, thou wilt forsure grant my desire ✿ Whose heart is melted in love’s hottest fire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the fisherman heard her words, he wept and made moan
and lamented; then, recalling what had betided himself in the
days of his youth, when love had the mastery over him and longing
and desire and distraction were sore upon him and the fires of
passion consumed him, replied with these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">What fair excuse is this my pining plight, ✿ With wasted limbs and tears’ unceasing blight;</div>
      <div class="line">And eyelids open in the nightly murk, ✿ And heart like fire-stick<a id="r70"></a><a href="#f70" class="c011"><sup>[70]</sup></a> ready fire to smite;</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed love burdened us in early youth, ✿ And true from false coin soon we learned aright:</div>
      <div class="line">Then did we sell our soul on way of love, ✿ And drunk of many a well<a id="r71"></a><a href="#f71" class="c011"><sup>[71]</sup></a> to win her sight;</div>
      <div class="line">Venturing very life to gain her grace, ✿ And make high profit perilling a mite.</div>
      <div class="line">‘Tis Love’s religion whoso buys with life ✿ His lover’s grace, with highest gain is dight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he ended his verse, he moored his boat to the beach and
said to her, “Embark, so may I carry thee whither thou wilt.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>Thereupon she embarked and he put off with her; but they had
not gone far from land, before there came out a stern-wind upon
the boat and drove it swiftly out of sight of shore. Now the
fisherman knew not whither he went, and the strong wind blew
without ceasing three days, when it fell by leave of Allah Almighty,
and they sailed on and ceased not sailing till they came in
sight of a city sitting upon the sea-shore,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
fisherman’s craft, carrying Rose-in-Hood, made the city sitting
upon the sea shore, the man set about making fast to the land. Now
the King of the city was a Prince of pith and puissance named
Dirbás, the Lion; and he chanced at that moment to be seated,
with his son, at a window in the royal palace giving upon the sea;
and happening to look out seawards, they saw the fishing-boat
make the land. They observed it narrowly and espied therein a
young lady, as she were the full moon overhanging the horizon-edge,
with pendants in her ears of costly balass-rubies and a collar
of precious stones about her throat. Hereby the King knew that
this must indeed be the daughter of some King or great noble and,
going forth of the sea-gate of the palace, went down to the boat,
where he found the lady asleep and the fisherman busied in
making fast to shore. So he went up to her and aroused her,
whereupon she awoke, weeping; and he asked her, “Whence
comest thou and whose daughter art thou and what be the cause
of thy coming hither?”; and she answered, “I am the daughter of
Ibrahim, Wazir to King Shámikh; and the manner of my coming
hither is wondrous and the cause thereof marvellous.” And she
told him her whole story first and last, hiding naught from him;
then she groaned aloud and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Tear-drops have chafed mine eyelids and rail down in wondrous wise, ✿ For parting pain that fills my sprite and turns to springs mine eyes,</div>
      <div class="line">For sake of friend who ever dwells within my vitals homed, ✿ And I may never win my wish of him in any guise.</div>
      <div class="line">He hath a favour fair and bright, and brilliant is his face, ✿ Which every Turk and Arab wight in loveliness outvies:</div>
      <div class="line">The Sun and fullest Moon lout low whenas his charms they sight, ✿ And lover-like they bend to him whene’er he deigneth rise.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>A wondrous spell of gramarye like Kohl bedecks his eyne, ✿ And shows thee bow with shaft on string made ready ere it flies:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou, to whom I told my case expecting all excuse, ✿ Pity a lover-wight for whom Love-shafts such fate devise!</div>
      <div class="line">Verily, Love hath cast me on your coast despite of me ✿ Of will now weak, and fain I trust mine honour thou wilt prize:</div>
      <div class="line">For noble men, whenas perchance alight upon their bounds, ✿ Grace-worthy guests, confess their worth and raise to dignities.</div>
      <div class="line">Then, O thou hope of me, to lovers’ folly veil afford ✿ And be to them reunion cause, thou only liefest lord!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when she had ended her verses, she again told the King her
sad tale and shed plenteous tears and recited these couplets bearing
on her case:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">We lived till saw we all the marvels Love can bear; ✿ Each month to thee we hope shall fair as Rajab<a id="r72"></a><a href="#f72" class="c011"><sup>[72]</sup></a> fare:</div>
      <div class="line">Is it not wondrous, when I saw them march amorn ✿ That I with water o’ eyes in heart lit flames that flare?</div>
      <div class="line">That these mine eyelids rain fast dropping gouts of blood? ✿ That now my cheek grows gold where rose and lily were?</div>
      <div class="line">As though the safflower hue, that overspread my cheeks, ✿ Were Joseph’s coat made stain of lying blood to wear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the King heard her words he was certified of her love
and longing and was moved to ruth for her; so he said to her,
“Fear nothing and be not troubled; thou hast come to the term of
thy wishes; for there is no help but that I win for thee thy will
and bring thee to thy desire.” And he improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Daughter of nobles, who thine aim shalt gain; ✿ Hear gladdest news nor fear aught hurt or bane!</div>
      <div class="line">This day I’ll pack up wealth, and send it on ✿ To Shámikh, guarded by a champion-train;</div>
      <div class="line">Fresh pods of musk I’ll send him and brocades, ✿ And silver white and gold of yellow vein:</div>
      <div class="line">Yes, and a letter shall inform him eke ✿ That I of kinship with that King am fain:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>And I this day will lend thee bestest aid, ✿ That all thou covetest thy soul assain.</div>
      <div class="line">I, too, have tasted love and know its taste ✿ And can excuse whoso the same cup drain.<a id="r73"></a><a href="#f73" class="c011"><sup>[73]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, ending his verse, he went forth to his troops and summoned
his Wazir; and, causing him to pack up countless treasure, commanded
him carry it to King Shamikh and say to him, “Needs
must thou send me a person named Uns al-Wujud;” and say
moreover “The King is minded to ally himself with thee by marrying
his daughter to Uns al-Wujud, thine officer. So there is no
help but thou despatch him to me, that the marriage may be
solemnized in her father’s kingdom.” And he wrote a letter to
King Shamikh to this effect, and gave it to the Minister, charging
him strictly to bring back Uns al-Wujud and warning him, “An
thou fail thou shalt be deposed and degraded.” Answered the
Wazir, “I hear and obey;” and, setting out forthright with the
treasures, in due course arrived at the court of King Shamikh
whom he saluted in the name of King Dirbas and delivered the
letter and the presents. Now when King Shamikh read the letter
and saw the name of Uns al-Wujud, he burst into tears and said to
the Wazir “And where, oh where, is Uns al-Wujud?; he went
from us and we know not his place of abiding; only bring him to
me, and I will give thee double the presents thou hast brought
me.” And he wept and groaned and lamented, saying these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To me restore my dear; ✿ I want not wealth untold:</div>
      <div class="line">Nor crave I gifts of pearls ✿ Or gems or store of gold:</div>
      <div class="line">He was to us a moon ✿ In beauty’s heavenly fold.</div>
      <div class="line">Passing in form and soul; ✿ With roe compare withhold!</div>
      <div class="line">His form a willow-wand, ✿ His fruit, lures manifold;</div>
      <div class="line">But willow lacketh power ✿ Men’s hearts to have and hold.</div>
      <div class="line">I reared him from a babe ✿ On cot of coaxing roll’d;</div>
      <div class="line">And now I mourn for him ✿ With woe in soul ensoul’d.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, turning to the Wazir who had brought the presents and the
missive, he said, “Go back to thy liege and acquaint him that Uns
al-Wujud hath been missing this year past, and his lord knoweth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>not whither he is gone nor hath any tidings of him.” Answered the
Minister of King Dirbas, “O my lord, my master said to me:—An
thou fail to bring him back, thou shalt be degraded from the
Wazirate and shalt not enter my city. How then can I return
without him?” So King Shamikh said to his Wazir Ibrahim,
“Take a company and go with him and make ye search for Uns
al-Wujud everywhere.” He replied, “Hearkening and obedience;”
and, taking a body of his own retainers, set out accompanied by
the Wazir of King Dirbas seeking Uns al-Wujud.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ibrahim,
Wazir to King Shamikh, took him a body of his retainers and,
accompanied by the Minister of King Dirbas, set out seeking Uns
al-Wujud. And as often as they fell in with wild Arabs or others
they asked of the youth, saying, “Tell us have ye seen a man
whose name is so and so and his semblance thus and thus?” But
they all answered, “We know him not.” Still they continued
their quest enquiring in city and hamlet and seeking in fertile
plain and stony hall and in the wild and in the wold, till they
made the Mountain of the Bereaved Mother; and the Wazir of
King Dirbas said to Ibrahim, “Why is this mountain thus called?”
He answered, “Once of old time, here sojourned a Jinniyah, of the
Jinn of China, who loved a mortal with passionate love; and, being
in fear of her life from her own people, searched all the earth over
for a place, where she might hide him from them, till she happened
on this mountain and, finding it cut off from both men and Jinn,
there being no access to it, carried off her beloved and lodged him
therein. There, when she could escape notice of her kith and kin,
she used privily to visit him, and continued so doing till she had
borne him a number of children; and the merchants, sailing by
the mountain, in their voyages over the main, heard the weeping
of the children, as it were the wailing of a woman bereft of her
babes, and said:—Is there here a mother bereaved of her children?
For which reason the place was named the Mountain of the
Bereaved Mother.” And the Wazir of King Dirbas marvelled at
his words. Then they landed and, making for the castle, knocked
at the gate which was opened to them by an eunuch, who knew
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>the Wazir Ibrahim and kissed his hands. The Minister entered
and found in the courtyard, among the serving-men, a Fakir, which
was Uns al-Wujud, but he knew him not and said, “Whence
cometh yonder wight?” Quoth they, “He is a merchant, who
hath lost his goods, but saved himself; and he is an ecstatic.”<a id="r74"></a><a href="#f74" class="c011"><sup>[74]</sup></a> So
the Wazir left him and went on into the castle, where he found
no trace of his daughter and questioned her women, who answered,
“We wot not how or whither she went; this place misliked her
and she tarried in it but a short time.” Whereupon he wept sore
and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ho thou, the house, whose birds were singing gay, ✿ Whose sills their wealth and pride were wont display!</div>
      <div class="line">Till came the lover wailing for his love, ✿ And found thy doors wide open to the way;</div>
      <div class="line">Would Heaven I knew where is my soul that erst ✿ Was homed in house, whose owners fared away!</div>
      <div class="line">‘Twas stored with all things bright and beautiful, ✿ And showed its porters ranged in fair array:</div>
      <div class="line">They clothed it with brocades a bride become;<a id="r75"></a><a href="#f75" class="c011"><sup>[75]</sup></a> ✿ Would I knew whither went its lords, ah, say!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">After ending his verses he again shed tears, and groaned and
bemoaned himself, exclaiming, “There is no deliverance from the
destiny decreed by Allah; nor is there any escape from that which
He hath predestined!” Then he went up to the roof and found
the strips of Ba’albak stuff tied to the crenelles and hanging down
to the ground, and thus it was he knew that she had descended
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>thence and had fled forth, as one distracted and demented with
desire and passion. Presently, he turned and seeing there two
birds, a gor-crow and an owl he justly deemed this an omen of ill;
so he groaned and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I came to my dear friends’ door, of my hopes the goal, ✿ Whose sight mote assuage my sorrow and woes of soul:</div>
      <div class="line">No friends found I there, nor was there another thing ✿ To find, save a corby-crow and an ill-omened owl.</div>
      <div class="line">And the tongue o’ the case to me seemed to say, “Indeed ✿ This parting two lovers fond was cruel and foul!”</div>
      <div class="line">“So taste thou the sorrow thou madest them taste and live ✿ In grief: wend thy ways and now in thy sorrow prowl!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he descended from the castle-roof, weeping, and bade the
servants fare forth and search the mount for their mistress; so
they sought for her, but found her not. Such was their case; but
as regards Uns al-Wujud, when he was certified that Rose-in-Hood
was indeed gone, he cried with a great cry and fell down in a
fainting-fit, nor came to himself for a long time, whilst the folk
deemed that his spirit had been withdrawn by the Compassionating
One; and that he was absorbed in contemplation of the
splendour, majesty and beauty of the Requiting One. Then,
despairing of finding Uns al-Wujud, and seeing that the Wazir
Ibrahim was distracted for the loss of his daughter, the Minister
of King Dirbas addressed himself to return to his own country,
albeit he had not attained the object of his journey, and while
bidding his companion adieu, said to him, “I have a mind to take
the Fakir with me; it may be Allah Almighty will incline the
King’s heart to me by his blessing, for that he is a holy man; and
thereafter, I will send him to Ispahan, which is near our country.”
“Do as thou wilt,” answered Ibrahim. So they took leave of each
other and departed, each for his own mother land, the Wazir of
King Dirbas carrying with him Uns al-Wujud——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir
of King Dirbas carried with him Uns al-Wujud who was still
insensible. They bore him with them on mule-back (he unknowing
if he were carried or not) for three days, when he came to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>himself and said, “Where am I?” “Thou art in company with
the Minister of King Dirbas,” replied they and went and gave
news of his recovering to the Wazir, who sent him rose-water and
sherbet of sugar, of which they gave him to drink and restored
him. Then they ceased not faring on till they drew near King
Dirbas’s capital and the King, being advised of his Wazir’s coming,
wrote to him, saying, “If Uns al-Wujud be not with thee, come
not to me ever.” Now when the Wazir read the royal mandate,
it was grievous to him, for he knew not that Rose-in-Wood
was with the King, nor why he had been sent in quest of Uns
al-Wujud, nor the King’s reason for desiring the alliance; whilst
Uns al-Wujud also knew not whither they were bearing him or
that the Wazir had been sent in quest of him; nor did the Wazir
know that the Fakir he had with him was Uns al-Wujud himself.
And when the Minister saw that the sick man was whole, he said
to him, “I was despatched by the King on an errand, which I have
not been able to accomplish. So, when he heard of my return, he
wrote to me, saying:—Except thou have fulfilled my need enter
not my city.” “And what is the King’s need?” asked Uns al-Wujud.
So the Wazir told him the whole tale, and he said, “Fear
nothing, but go boldly to the King and take me with thee; and I
will be surety to thee for the coming of Uns al-Wujud.” At this
the Wazir rejoiced and cried, “Is this true which thou sayest?”
“Yes,” replied he; whereupon the Wazir mounted and carried
him to King Dirbas who, after receiving their salutations said to
him, “Where is Uns al-Wujud?” Answered the young man, “O
King, I know where he is.” So the King called him to him and
said, “Where?” Returned Uns al-Wujud, “He is nearhand and
very near; but tell me what thou wouldst with him, and I will
fetch him into thy presence.” The King replied, “With joy and
good gree, but the case calleth for privacy.” So he ordered the
folk to withdraw and, carrying Uns al-Wujud into his cabinet,
told him the whole story; whereupon quoth the youth, “Robe me
in rich raiment, and I will forthright bring Uns al-Wujud to thee.”
So they brought him a sumptuous dress, and he donned it and
said, “I am Uns al-Wujud, the World’s Delight, and to the envious
a despite”; and presently he smote with his glances every sprite,
and began these couplets to recite:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My loved one’s name in cheerless solitude aye cheereth me ✿ And driveth off my desperance and long despondency:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>I have no helper<a id="r76"></a><a href="#f76" class="c011"><sup>[76]</sup></a> but my tears that ever flow in fount, ✿ And as they flow, they lighten woe and force my grief to flee.</div>
      <div class="line">My longing is so violent naught like it ere was seen; ✿ My love-tale is a marvel and my love a sight to see:</div>
      <div class="line">I spend the night with lids of eye that never close in sleep, ✿ And pass in passion twixt the Hells and Edens heavenly.</div>
      <div class="line">I had of patience fairish store, but now no more have I; ✿ And love’s sole gift to me hath been aye-growing misery:</div>
      <div class="line">My frame is wasted by the pain of parting from my own, ✿ And longing changed my shape and form and made me other be.</div>
      <div class="line">Mine eyelids by my torrent tears are chafed, and ulcerate, ✿ The tears, whose flow to stay is mere impossibility.</div>
      <div class="line">My manly strength is sore impaired for I have lost my heart; ✿ How many griefs upon my griefs have I been doomed to dree!</div>
      <div class="line">My heart and head are like in age with similar hoariness ✿ By loss of Beauty’s lord,<a id="r77"></a><a href="#f77" class="c011"><sup>[77]</sup></a> of lords the galaxy:</div>
      <div class="line">Despite our wills they parted us and doomed us parted wone, ✿ While they (our lords) desire no more than love in unity.</div>
      <div class="line">Then ah, would Heaven that I wot if stress of parting done, ✿ The world will grant me sight of them in union fain and free—</div>
      <div class="line">Roll up the scroll of severance which others would unroll— ✿ Efface my trouble by the grace of meeting’s jubilee!</div>
      <div class="line">And shall I see them homed with me and in cup-company, ✿ And change my melancholic mood for joy and jollity?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he ended his verses the King cried aloud, “By Allah,
ye are indeed a pair of lovers true and fain and in Beauty’s heaven
of shining stars a twain: your story is wondrous and your case
marvellous.” Then he told him all that had befallen Rose-in-Hood;
and Uns al-Wujud said, “Where is she, O King of the
age?” “She is with me now,” answered Dirbas and, sending for
the Kazi and the witnesses, drew up the contract of marriage
between her and him. Then he honoured Uns al-Wujud with
favours and bounties and sent to King Shamikh acquainting him
with what had befallen, whereat this King joyed with exceeding
joy and wrote back to the following purport. “Since the ceremony
of contract hath been performed at thy court, it behoveth that
the marriage and its consummation be at mine.” Then he made
ready camels, horses and men and sent them in quest of the
pair; and when the embassy reached King Dirbas, he gave the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>lovers much treasure and despatched them to King Shamikh’s
court with a company of his own troops. The day of their arrival
was a notable day, never was seen a grander; for the King gathered
together all the singing-women and players on instruments of
music and made wedding banquets and held high festival seven
days; and on each day he gave largesse to the folk and bestowed
on them sumptuous robes of honour. Then Uns al-Wujud went in
to Rose-in-Hood and they embraced and sat weeping for excess
of joy and gladness, whilst she recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Joyance is come, dispelling cark and care; ✿ We are united, enviers may despair.</div>
      <div class="line">The breeze of union blows, enquickening ✿ Forms, hearts and vitals, fresh with fragrant air:</div>
      <div class="line">The splendour of delight with scents appears, ✿ And round us<a id="r78"></a><a href="#f78" class="c011"><sup>[78]</sup></a> flags and drums show gladness rare.</div>
      <div class="line">Deem not we’re weeping for our stress of grief; ✿ It is for joy our tears as torrents fare:</div>
      <div class="line">How many fears we’ve seen that now are past! ✿ And bore we patient what was sore to bear:</div>
      <div class="line">One hour of joyance made us both forget ✿ What from excess of terror grey’d our hair.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when the verses were ended, they again embraced and ceased
not from their embrace, till they fell down in a swoon,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eighty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Uns
al-Wujud and Rose-in-Hood embraced when they foregathered
and ceased not from their embrace, till they fell down in a swoon
for the delight of reunion; and when they came to themselves,
Uns al-Wujud recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How joyously sweet are the nights that unite, ✿ When my dearling deigns keep me the troth she did plight;</div>
      <div class="line">When union conjoins us in all that we have, ✿ And parting is severed and sundered from sight,</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>To us comes the world with her favour so fair, ✿ After frown and aversion and mighty despight!</div>
      <div class="line">Hath planted her banner Good Fortune for us, ✿ And we drink of her cup in the purest delight.</div>
      <div class="line">We have met and complained of the pitiful Past, ✿ And of nights a full many that doomed us to blight.</div>
      <div class="line">But now, O my lady, the Past is forgot; ✿ The Compassionate pardon the Past for unright!</div>
      <div class="line">How sweet is existence, how glad is to be! ✿ This union my passion doth only incite.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he ended his verses they once more embraced, drowned
in the sea of passion; and lay down together in the private apartment
carousing and conversing and quoting verses and telling
pleasant tales and anecdotes. On this wise seven days passed
over them whilst they knew not night from day and it was to them,
for very stress of gaiety and gladness, pleasure and possession, as
if the seven days were but one day with ne’er a morrow. Nor did
they know the seventh day,<a id="r79"></a><a href="#f79" class="c011"><sup>[79]</sup></a> but by the coming of the singers and
players on instruments of music; whereat Rose-in-Hood beyond
measure wondered and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">In spite of enviers’ jealousy, at end ✿ We have won all we hoped of the friend:</div>
      <div class="line">We’ve crowned our meeting with a close embrace ✿ On quilts where new brocades with sendal blend;</div>
      <div class="line">On bed of perfumed leather, which the spoils ✿ Of downy birds luxuriously distend.</div>
      <div class="line">But I abstain me from unneeded wine, ✿ When honey-dews of lips sweet must can lend:</div>
      <div class="line">Now from the sweets of union we unknow ✿ Time near and far, if slow or fast it wend,</div>
      <div class="line">The seventh night hath come and gone, O strange! ✿ How went the nights we never reckt or kenned;</div>
      <div class="line">Till, on the seventh wishing joy they said, ✿ “Allah prolong the meet of friend with friend!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she had finished her song, Uns al-Wujud kissed her, more
than an hundred times, and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>O day of joys to either lover fain! ✿ The loved one came and freed from lonely pain:</div>
      <div class="line">She blest me with all inner charms she hath; ✿ And companied with inner grace deep lain:</div>
      <div class="line">She made me drain the wine of love till I, ✿ Was faint with joys her love had made me drain:</div>
      <div class="line">We toyed and joyed and on each other lay; ✿ Then fell to wine and soft melodious strain:</div>
      <div class="line">And for excess of joyance never knew, ✿ How went the day and how it came again.</div>
      <div class="line">Fair fall each lover, may he union win ✿ And gain of joy like me the amplest gain;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor weet the taste of severance’ bitter fruit ✿ And joys assain them as they us assain!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then they went forth and distributed to the folk alms and presents
of money and raiment and rare gifts and other tokens of generosity;
after which Rose-in-Hood bade clear the bath for her<a id="r80"></a><a href="#f80" class="c011"><sup>[80]</sup></a> and, turning
to Uns al-Wujud said to him, “O coolth of my eyes, I have a mind
to see thee in the Hammam, and therein we will be alone together.”
He joyfully consented to this, and she let scent the Hammam with
all sorts of perfumed woods and essences, and light the wax-candles.
Then of the excess of her contentment she recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O who didst win my love in other date ✿ (And Present e’er must speak of past estate);</div>
      <div class="line">And, oh! who art my sole sufficiency, ✿ Nor want I other friends with me to mate:</div>
      <div class="line">Come to the Hammam, O my light of eyes, ✿ And enter Eden through Gehenna-gate!</div>
      <div class="line">We’ll scent with ambergris and aloes-wood ✿ Till float the heavy clouds with fragrant freight;</div>
      <div class="line">And to the World we’ll pardon all her sins ✿ And sue for mercy the Compassionate;</div>
      <div class="line">And I will cry, when I descry thee there, ✿ “Good cheer, sweet love, all blessings on thee wait!”<a id="r81"></a><a href="#f81" class="c011"><sup>[81]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whereupon they arose and fared to the bath and took their
pleasure therein; after which they returned to their palace and
there abode in the fulness of enjoyment, till there came to them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies; and glory
be to Him who changeth not neither ceaseth, and to whom everything

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r52">52</a>.  </span>Arab. “Istikhárah,” before explained as praying for direction by omens of the
rosary, opening the Koran and reading the first verse sighted, etc., etc. At
Al-Medinah it is called Khírah and I have suggested (Pilgrimage, ii. 287) that it is a
relic of the Azlam or Kidah (divining arrows) of paganism. But the superstition is
not local: we have the Sortes Virgilianæ (Virgil being a magician) as well as Coranicæ.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r54">54</a>.  </span>Arab. “Khilál,” as an emblem of attenuation occurring in Al-Hariri (Ass. of
Alexandria, etc.); also thin as a spindle (Maghzal), as a reed, and dry as a pair of
shears. In the Ass. of Barka’id the toothpick is described as a beautiful girl. The
use of this cleanly article was enjoined by Mohammed:—“Cleanse your mouths with
toothpicks; for your mouths are the abode of the guardian angels; whose pens are
the tongues, and whose ink is the spittle of men; and to whom naught is more unbearable
than remains of food in the mouth.” A mighty apparatus for a small
matter; but in very hot lands cleanliness must rank before godliness.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r56">56</a>.  </span>Arab. “líf” (not “fibres which grow at the top of the trunk,” Lane ii. 577); but
the fibre of the fronds worked like the cocoa-nut fibre which forms the now well-known
Indian “coir.” This “líf” is also called “filfil” or “fulfil” which Dr.
Jonathan Scott renders “pepper” (Lane i. 8) and it forms a clean succedaneum for
one of the uncleanest articles of civilisation, the sponge. It is used in every Hammam
and is (or should be) thrown away after use.</p>

<div class="footnote" id="f57">

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r58">58</a>.  </span>The eunuch tells him that he is not a “Sandalí” = one whose penis and testes are
removed; and consequently the highest valued. There are many ways of making the
castrato; in some (as here) only the penis is removed, in others the testes are bruised or
cut off; but in all cases the animal passion remains, for in man, unlike other animals, the
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">fons veneris</span></i> is the brain. The story of Abelard proves this. Juvenal derided the idea
of married eunuchs and yet almost all these neutrals have wives with whom they practise
the manifold <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">plaisirs de la petite oie</span></i> (masturbation, tribadism, irrumation, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-bêche</span>,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feuille-de-rose</span>, etc.), till they induce the venereal orgasm. Such was the account once
given to me by a eunuch’s wife; and I need hardly say that she, like her confrerie was to
be pitied. At the critical moment she held up a little pillow for her husband to bite who
otherwise would have torn her cheeks or breasts.</p>

11 and 12) the yearly peace, during which a man might not kill his father’s murderer.
The idea must have taken deep root, as Arab history records only six “impious (or sacrilegious)
wars,” waged despite the law. Europeans compare it with the Treuga Dei (truce
of God) a seven-years peace established about A.D. 1032, by a Bishop of Aquitaine; and
followed in A.D. 1245 by the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pax Regis</span> (Royal Peace) under Louis VIII. of France.

<div class="footnote" id="f74">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r74">74</a>.  </span>Arab. “Majzub” = drawn, attracted (literally); the popular term for one absorbed
in the contemplation of the Deity. During this process the soul is supposed to quit the
body leaving the latter irresponsible for its actions. I remember a scandal being caused
in a village near Tunis by one of these men who suddenly started up from his seat in a
dusty corner and, in presence of a small crowd of people, had connection with a she-donkey.
The supporters of the holy man declared that the deed was proof positive of
his exceptional holiness; but there were lewd fellows, Moslems Voltaireans, who had
their doubts and held that the reverend man had so acted “for the gallery.” A similar
story is told with due reserve by the late Abbe Hamilton in his book on the Cyrenaic.
There are three grand divisions of the Sufis; (1) Mukímán, the stationaries; (2) Sálikán,
the travellers, or progressives, and (3) Wásilán, those who reach the desired end. And
No. 2 has two classes: the Sálik-i-majzúb, one progressing in Divine Love; and the
other, who has made greater progress, is the Majzúb-i-Sálik (Dabistan iii. 251).</p>

means simply the lost girl.</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">Abu Nowas one day shut himself up and, making ready a richly-furnished
feast, collected for it meats of all kinds and of every
colour that lips and tongue can desire. Then he went forth, to
seek a minion worthy of such entertainment, saying, “Allah, my
Lord and my Master, I beseech Thee to send me one who befitteth
this banquet and who is fit to carouse with me this day!” Hardly
had he made an end of speaking when he espied three youths
handsome and beardless, as they were of the boys of Paradise,<a id="r83"></a><a href="#f83" class="c011"><sup>[83]</sup></a>
differing in complexion but fellows in incomparable beauty; and
all hearts yearned with desire to the swaying of their bending
shapes, even to what saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I passed a beardless pair without compare ✿ And cried, “I love you, both you ferly fair!”</div>
      <div class="line">“Money’d?” quoth one: quoth I, “And lavish too;” ✿ Then said the fair pair, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père, c’est notre affaire</span></i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now Abu Nowas was given to these joys and loved to sport
and make merry with fair boys and cull the rose from every
brightly blooming cheek, even as saith the bard:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Full many a reverend Shaykh feels sting of flesh, ✿ Loves pretty faces, shows at Pleasure’s depot:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So he accosted them with the salutation, and they returned his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>greeting with civility and all honour and would have gone their
several ways, but he stayed them, repeating these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereupon the youths were beguiled by his verses and consented
to his wishes——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Abu Nowas beguiled the youths with his verse, they consented to
his wishes, saying, “We hear and obey;” and accompanied him
to his lodging, where they found all ready that he had set forth
in his couplets. They sat down and ate and drank and made
merry awhile, after which they appealed to Abu Nowas to decide
which of them was handsomest of face and shapeliest of form.
So he pointed to one of them and, having kissed him twice over,
recited the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

    </div>

<p class="c000">Then he pointed to another and, kissing his lips, repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And loveling weareth on his cheek a mole ✿ Like musk, which virgin camphor ne’er lets off it:</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>Then he pointed to the third and, after kissing him half a score

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now each of the youths had drunk two cups, and when it came
to the turn of Abu Nowas, he took the goblet and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Drink not strong wine save at the slender dearling’s hand; ✿ Each like to other in all gifts the spirit grace:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he drank off his cup and the bowl went round, and when it
came to Abu Nowas again, joyance got the mastery of him and he
repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently the drink got into his noddle, drunkenness mastered
him and he knew not hand from head, so that he lolled from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>side to side in joy and inclined to the youths one and all,
anon kissing them and anon embracing them leg overlying leg.
And he showed no sense of sin or shame, but recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

      <div class="line">Let us drink our good liquor both watered and pure, ✿ And agree to swive all who dare slumber and sleep.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">While they were in this deboshed state behold, there came a
knocking at the door; so they bade him who knocked enter, and
behold, it was the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid.
When they saw him, they all rose and kissed ground before him;
and Abu Nowas threw off the fumes of the wine for awe of the
Caliph, who said to him, “Holla, Abu Nowas!” He replied,
“Adsum, at thy service, O Commander of the Faithful, whom
Allah preserve!” The Caliph asked, “What state is this?” and
the poet answered, “O Prince of True Believers, my state indubitably
dispenseth with questions.” Quoth the Caliph, “O Abu
Nowas, I have sought direction of Allah Almighty and have appointed
thee Kazi of pimps and panders.” Asked he, “Dost
thou indeed invest me with that high office, O Commander of the
Faithful?” and the Caliph answered “I do;” whereupon Abu
Nowas rejoined, “O Commander of the Faithful, hast thou any
suit to prefer to me?” Hereat the Caliph was wroth and presently
turned away and left them, full of rage, and passed the
night sore an-angered against Abu Nowas, who amid the party
he had invited spent the merriest of nights and the jolliest and
joyousest. And when daybreak dawned and the star of morn
appeared in sheen and shone, he broke up the sitting and, dismissing
the youths, donned his court-dress and leaving his house set out
for the palace of the Caliph. Now it was the custom of the Commander
of the Faithful, when the Divan broke up, to withdraw
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>to his sitting-saloon and summon thither his poets and cup-companions
and musicians, each having his own place, which he
might not overpass. So it happened that day, he retired to his
saloon, and the friends and familiars came and seated themselves,
each in his rank and degree. Presently, in walked Abu Nowas
and was about to take his usual seat, when the Caliph cried to
Masrur, the sworder, and bade him strip the poet of his clothes
and bind an ass’s packsaddle on his back and a halter about
his head and a crupper under his rump and lead him round to
all the lodgings of the slave-girls,——And Shahrazad perceived

the lodgings of the slave-girls, and the chambers of the Harim,
that the women might make mock of him; then cut off his head
and bring it to him. “Hearkening and obedience,” replied Masrur
and, doing with Abu Nowas as the Caliph had bidden him, led
him round all the chambers whose number equalled the days of
the year; but Abu Nowas was a funny fellow, so he made all the
girls laugh with his buffooneries and each gave him something
whereby he returned not save with a pocketful of money. And
while this was going on behold, Ja’afar the Barmecide, who had
been absent on an important business for the Commander of the
Faithful, entered and recognising the poet, albeit in this plight,
said to him, “Holla, Abu Nowas!” He said, “Here at thy
service, O our lord.” Ja’afar asked, “What offence hast thou
committed to bring this punishment on thee?” Thereupon he
answered, “None whatsoever, except that I made our lord the
Caliph a present of the best of my poetry and he presented me, in
return, with the best of his raiment.” When the Prince of True
Believers heard this, he laughed, from a heart full of wrath,<a id="r98"></a><a href="#f98" class="c011"><sup>[98]</sup></a> and
pardoned Abu Nowas, and also gave him a myriad of money.

  <h2 id="c69" class="c007">ABDALLAH BIN MA’AMAR WITH THE MAN OF BASSORAH AND HIS SLAVE-GIRL.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">A certain man of Bassorah once bought a slave-girl and reared
and educated her right well. Moreover, he loved her very dearly
and spent all his substance in pleasuring and merry-making with
her, till he had naught left and extreme poverty was sore upon him.
So she said to him, “O my master, sell me; for thou needest my
price and it maketh my heart ache to see thy sorry and want-full
plight. If thou vend me and make use of my value, ‘twill be
better for thee than keeping me by thee, and haply Almighty
Allah will ample thee and amend thy fortune.” He agreed to this
for the straitness of his case, and carried her to the bazar, where
the broker offered her for sale to the Governor of Bassorah, by
name Abdallah bin Ma’amar al-Taymi, and she pleased him. So
he bought her, for five hundred dinars and paid the sum to her
master; but when he took the money and was about to go away,
the girl burst into tears and repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">May coins thou gainest joy in heart instil; ✿ For me remaineth naught save saddest ill:</div>
      <div class="line">I say unto my soul which sorely grieves, ✿ “Thy friend departeth an thou will or nill.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when her master heard this, he groaned and replied in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Albeit this thy case lack all resource, ✿ Nor findest aught but death’s doom, pardon still:</div>
      <div class="line">Evening and morning, thoughts of thee will dole ✿ Comfort to heart all woes and griefs full fill:</div>
      <div class="line">Peace be upon thee! meet we now no more ✿ Nor pair except at Ibn Ma’amar’s will.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when Abdullah bin Ma’amar heard these verses and saw their
affection, he exclaimed, “By Allah, I will not assist fate in separating
you; for it is evident to me that ye two indeed love each
other. So take the money and the damsel, O man, and Allah
bless thee in both; for verily parting be grievous to lovers.” So
they kissed his hand and going away, ceased not to dwell together,
till death did them part; and glory be to Him whom death over-taketh
not! And amongst stories is that of</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, among the Banu ‘Ozrah, a handsome and accomplished
man, who was never a single day out of love, and it
chanced that he became enamoured of a beauty of his own tribe
and sent her many messages; but she ceased not to entreat him
with cruelty and disdain; till, for stress of love and longing and
desire and distraction, he fell sick of a sore sickness and took to
his pillow and murdered sleep. His malady redoubled on him
and his torments increased and he was well nigh dead when his
case became known among the folk and his passion notorious——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the man
took to his pillow and murdered sleep. So his case became known
among the folk and his passion notorious; and his infirmity grew
upon him and his pains redoubled till he was well nigh dead. His
family and hers were urgent with her to visit him, but she refused,
till he was at the point of death when, being told of this, she
relented towards him and vouchsafed him a visit. As soon as he
saw her, his eyes ran over with tears and he repeated from a
broken heart:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An, by thy life, pass thee my funeral train, ✿ A bier upborne upon the necks of four,</div>
      <div class="line">Wilt thou not follow it, and greet the grave ✿ Where shall my corpse be graved for evermore?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hearing this, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, “By
Allah, I suspected not that passion had come to such a pass
with thee, as to cast thee into the arms of death! Had I wist of
this, I had been favourable to thy wish, and thou shouldst have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>had thy will.” At this his tears streamed down even as the clouds
rail rain, and he repeated this verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She drew near whenas death was departing us, ✿ And deigned union grant when ‘twas useless all.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he groaned one groan and died. So she fell on him, kissing
him and weeping and ceased not weeping till she swooned away;
and when she came to herself, she charged her people to bury her
in his grave and with streaming eyes recited these two couplets:-</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she fell again to weeping, nor gave over shedding tears and
lamenting till she fainted away; and she lay three days, senseless.
Then she died and was buried in his grave. This is one of
the strange chances of love.<a id="r101"></a><a href="#f101" class="c011"><sup>[101]</sup></a> And I have heard related a tale of

  <h2 id="c71" class="c007">WAZIR OF AL-YAMAN AND HIS YOUNG BROTHER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">It is said that Badr al-Din, Wazir of Al-Yaman, had a young
brother of singular beauty and kept strait watch over him; so he
applied himself to seek a tutor for him and, coming upon a
Shaykh of dignified and reverend aspect, chaste and religious,
lodged him in a house next his own. This lasted a long time,
and he used to come daily from his dwelling to that of Sáhib<a id="r102"></a><a href="#f102" class="c011"><sup>[102]</sup></a>
Badr al-Din and teach the young brother. After a while, the old
man’s heart was taken with love for the youth, and longing grew
upon him and his vitals were troubled, till one day, he bemoaned
his case to the boy, who said, “What can I do, seeing that I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>may not leave my brother night or day? and thou thyself seest
how careful he is over me.” Quoth the Shaykh, “My lodging
adjoineth thine; so there will be no difficulty, when thy brother
sleepeth, to rise and entering the privy, feign thyself asleep. Then
come to the parapet<a id="r103"></a><a href="#f103" class="c011"><sup>[103]</sup></a> of the terrace-roof and I will receive thee on
the other side of the wall; so shalt thou sit with me an eye-twinkling
and return without thy brother’s knowledge.” “I hear
and obey,” answered the lad; and the tutor began to prepare gifts
suitable to his degree. Now when a while of the night was past, he
entered the water-closet and waited till his brother lay down on his
bed and took patience till he was drowned in sleep, when he rose
and going to the parapet of the terrace-roof, found standing there
to await him the old man, who gave him his hand and carried him
to the sitting-chamber, where he had made ready various dainties for
his entertainment, and they sat down to carouse. Now it was the
night of the full moon and, as they sat with the wine-cup going
round, her rays shone upon them, and the governor fell to singing.
But, whilst they were thus in joy and jollity and mirth and merriment,
such as confoundeth the wit and the sight and defieth
description, lo! the Wazir awoke and, missing his brother, arose in
affright and found the door open. So he went up to the roof and
hearing a noise of talk, climbed over the parapet to the adjoining
terrace and saw a light shining from the lodging. He looked in
from behind the wall, and espied his brother and his tutor sitting at
carouse: but the Shaykh became aware of him and sang cup in
hand, to a lively measure these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He made me drain his wine of honeyed lips, ✿ Toasting with cheeks which rose and myrtle smother:</div>
      <div class="line">Then nighted in embrace, cheek to my cheek, ✿ A loveling midst mankind without another.</div>
      <div class="line">When the full moon arose on us and shone ✿ Pray she traduce us not to the big brother.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And it proved the perfect politeness of the Wazir Badr al-Din
that, when he heard this, he said, “By Allah, I will not betray
you!” And he went away and left them to their diversions.
They also tell a tale concerning</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lad
fell passionately in love with the slave-lass: so one day, when the
other boys were heedless, he took her tablet<a id="r104"></a><a href="#f104" class="c011"><sup>[104]</sup></a> and wrote on it these

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the girl took her tablet, she read the verses written
thereon and understanding them, wept for ruth of him; then she

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now it chanced that the teacher came in on them and taking
the tablet, unnoticed, read what was written thereon. So he was
moved to pity of their case and wrote on the tablet beneath those
already written these two couplets addressed to the girl:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently it so happened that the girl’s owner entered the school
about the same time and, finding the tablet, read the above verses
indited by the boy, the girl and the schoolmaster; and wrote under
them these two couplets:—</p>

<p class="c000">Then he sent for the Kazi and witnesses and married them on the

  <h2 id="c74" class="c007">AL-MUTALAMMIS AND HIS WIFE UMAYMAH.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">It is related that Al-Mutalammis<a id="r105"></a><a href="#f105" class="c011"><sup>[105]</sup></a> once fled from Al-Nu’uman
bin Munzir<a id="r106"></a><a href="#f106" class="c011"><sup>[106]</sup></a> and was absent so long that folk deemed him dead.
Now he had a beautiful wife, Umaymah by name, and her family
urged her to marry again; but she refused, for that she loved her
husband Al-Mutalammis very dearly. However, they were urgent
with her, because of the multitude of her suitors, and importuned
her till she at last consented, albe reluctantly; and they espoused
her to a man of her own tribe. Now on the night of the wedding,
Al-Mutalammis came back and, hearing in the camp a noise of
pipes and tabrets and seeing signs of a wedding festival, asked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>some of the children what was the merry making, to which they
replied, “They have married Umaymah wife of Al-Mutalammis,
to such an one, and he goes in to her this night.” When he heard
this, he planned to enter the house amongst the mob of women
and saw the twain seated on the bridal couch.<a id="r107"></a><a href="#f107" class="c011"><sup>[107]</sup></a> By and by, the
bridegroom came up to her, whereupon she sighed heavily and
weeping, recited this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Would Heaven I knew (but many are the shifts of joy and woe) ✿ In what far distant land thou art, my Mutalammis, oh!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now Al-Mutalammis was a renowned poet; so he answered her
saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Right near at hand, Umaymah mine! whene’er the caravan ✿ Halted, I never ceased for thee to pine, I would thou know.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the bridegroom heard this, he guessed how the case stood
and went forth from among them in haste improvising:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I was in bestest luck, but now my luck goes contrary: ✿ A hospitable house and room contain your loves, you two!</div>

<p class="c000">And he returned not but left the twain to their privacy. So Al-Mutalammis
and his wife abode together in all comfort and solace

</div>

<p class="c012">The Caliph Harun al-Rashid loved the Lady Zubaydah with
exceeding love and laid out for her a pleasaunce, wherein he made
a great tank and set thereabouts a screen of trees and led thither
water from all sides; hence the trees grew and interlaced over the
basin so densely, that one could go in and wash, without being
<span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>seen of any, for the thickness of the leafage. It chanced, one day,
that Queen Zubaydah entered the garden and, coming to the
swimming-bath,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen
Zubaydah entered the garden one day and, coming to the swimming-bath,
gazed upon its goodliness; and the sheen of the water
and the overshading of the trees pleased her. Now it was a day
of exceeding heat; so she doffed her clothes and, entering the
tank, which was not deep enough to cover the whole person, fell
to pouring the water over herself from an ewer of silver. It also
happened that the Caliph heard she was in the pool; so he left
his palace and came down to spy upon her through the screen of
the foliage. He stood behind the trees and espied her mother-nude,
showing everything that is kept hidden. Presently, she
became aware of him and turning, saw him behind the trees and
was ashamed that he should see her naked. So she laid her hands
on her parts, but the Mount of Venus escaped from between them,
by reason of its greatness and plumpness; and the Caliph at once
turned and went away, wondering and reciting this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I looked on her with loving eyne ✿ And grew anew my old repine:</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">But he knew not what to say next; so he sent for Abu Nowas and
said to him, “Make me a piece of verse commencing with this
line.” “I hear and obey,” replied the poet and in an eye-twinkling
extemporised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I looked on her with longing eyne ✿ And grew anew my old repine</div>

not find in The Nights any allusion to that systematic <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">prolongatio veneris</span></i> which is so
much cultivated by Moslems under the name Imsák = retention, withholding <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the

of general prescriptions and the second of aphrodisiacs especially those <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui prolongent

Reverend Koka Pandit before quoted, gives a host of recipes which are used, either
externally or internally, to hasten the paroxysm of the woman and delay the orgasm of
the man (p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>). Some of these are curious in the extreme. I heard of a Hindi who made
a candle of frogs’ fat and fibre warranted to retain the seed till it burned out: it failed
notably because, relying upon it, he worked too vigorously. The essence of the
“retaining art” is to avoid over-tension of the muscles and to pre-occupy the brain:
hence in coition Hindus will drink sherbet, chew betel-nut and even smoke. Europeans
ignoring the science and practice, are contemptuously compared with village-cocks by
Hindu women who cannot be satisfied, such is their natural coldness, increased doubtless
by vegetable diet and unuse of stimulants, with less than twenty minutes. Hence too
while thousands of Europeans have cohabited for years with and have had families by
“native women,” they are never loved by them:—at least I never heard of a case.</p>

  <h2 id="c77" class="c007">HARUN AL-RASHID AND THE THREE POETS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The Prince of True Believers, Caliph Harun al-Rashid, was
exceeding restless one night; so he rose and walked about his
palace, till he happened on a handmaid overcome with wine. Now
he was prodigiously enamoured of this damsel; so he played with
her and pulled her to him, whereupon her zone fell down and her
petticoat-trousers were loosed and he besought her of amorous
favour. But she said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful
wait till to-morrow night, for I am unprepared for thee, knowing
not of thy coming.” So he left her and went away. But, when
the morrow showed its light and the sun shone bright, he sent a
page to her saying, “The Commander of the Faithful is about to
visit thine apartment;” but she replied, “Day doth away with the
promise of night.” So he said to his courtiers, make me somewhat
of verse, introducing these words, “The promise of Night is effaced
by Day.” Answered they, “We hear and obey,” and Al-Rakáshi<a id="r109"></a><a href="#f109" class="c011"><sup>[109]</sup></a>
came forward and recited the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By Allah, couldst thou but feel my pain, ✿ Thy rest had turned and had fled away.</div>

      <div class="line">She promised me grace, then jilted and said, ✿ “The promise of night is effaced by day!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Abu Mus’ab came forward and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When wilt thou be wise and love-heat allay ✿ That from food and sleeping so leads astray?</div>
      <div class="line">Suffices thee not ever weeping eye, ✿ And vitals on fire when thy name they say?</div>
      <div class="line">He must smile and laugh and in pride must cry ✿ “The promise of Night is effaced by Day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Last came Abu Nowas and recited the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">As love waxt longer less met we tway ✿ And fell out, but ended the useless fray;</div>
      <div class="line">One night in the palace I found her fou’; ✿ Yet of modesty still there was some display:</div>
      <div class="line">The veil from her shoulders had slipt; and showed ✿ Her loosened trousers Love’s seat and stay:</div>
      <div class="line">And rattled the breezes her huge hind cheeks ✿ And the branch where two little pomegranates lay:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth I, “Give me tryst;” whereto quoth she ✿ “To-morrow the fane shall wear best array:”</div>
      <div class="line">Next day I asked her, “Thy word?” Said she ✿ “The promise of Night is effaced by Day.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Caliph bade give a myriad of money each to Al-Rakashi and
Abu Mus’ab, but bade strike off the head of Abu Nowas, saying,
“Thou wast with us yesternight in the palace.” Said he, “By
Allah, I slept not but in my own house! I was directed to what I
said by thine own words as to the subject of the verse; and indeed
quoth Almighty Allah (and He is the truest of all speakers):—As
for poets (devils pursue them!) dost thou not see that they rove as
bereft of their senses through every valley and that they say that
which they do not?”<a id="r110"></a><a href="#f110" class="c011"><sup>[110]</sup></a> So the Caliph forgave him and gave him

Izzah, who was one of the shrewdest of women, and said to her,

should like thee to go her-wards and spy out for me how she is
made.” So she went away and returning to Mus’ab, said, “I have
seen her, and her face is fairer than health; she hath large and
well-opened eyes and under them a nose straight and smooth as a
cane; oval cheeks and a mouth like a cleft pomegranate, a neck as
a silver ewer and below it a bosom with two breasts like twin-pomegranates

stomach with a navel therein as it were a casket of ivory, and back
parts like a hummock of sand; and plumply rounded thighs and

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Izzah this wise reported of Ayishah bint Talhah, Mus’ab married
her and went in to her. And presently Izzah invited Ayishah
and the women of the tribe Kuraysh to her house, when Ayishah
sang these two couplets with Mus’ab standing by:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The night of Mus’ab’s going in unto her, he departed not from
her, till after seven bouts; and on the morrow, a freedwoman
of his met him and said to him, “May I be thy sacrifice! Thou

with Ayishah, when her husband came in to her, and she lusted
for him; so he fell upon her and she snarked and snorted and
made use of all manner of wondrous movements and marvellous
new inventions, and I the while within hearing.” So, when he
came out from her, I said to her, “How canst thou do thus
with thy rank and nobility and condition, and I in thy house?”
Quoth she, “Verily a woman should bring her husband all of

and wrigglings and motitations.<a id="r113"></a><a href="#f113" class="c011"><sup>[113]</sup></a> What dislikest thou of this?”

he putteth it out to me and I obey him, and it is as thou seest.”

<p class="c012">There was a miller, who had an ass to turn his mill; and he
was married to a wicked wife, whom he loved, while she hated
him because she was sweet upon a neighbour, who misliked
her and held aloof from her. One night, the miller saw, in his
sleep, one who said to him, “Dig in such a spot of the ass’s
round in the mill, and thou shalt find a hoard.” When he
awoke, he told his wife the vision and bade her keep the secret;
but she told her neighbour——And Shahrazad perceived the

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the miller’s
wife told the secret to the neighbour whom she loved, thinking
to win his favour; and he agreed with her to come to her by
night. So he came and they dug in the mill and found the
treasure and took it forth. Then he asked her, “How shall we
do with this?” and she answered; “We will divide it into
two halves and will share it equally between us, and do thou
leave thy wife and I will cast about to rid me of my husband.
Then shalt thou marry me and, when we are conjoined, we will
join the two halves of the treasure one to other, and all will be in
our hands.” Quoth he, “I fear lest Satan seduce thee and thou
take some man other than myself; for gold in the house is like
the sun in the world. I reck, therefore, it were right that the
money be all in my hands, so thou give thy whole mind to getting
free of thy husband and coming to me.” Quoth she, “I fear even
as thou fearest, nor will I yield up my part to thee; for it was I
directed thee to it.” When he heard this, greed of gain prompted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>him to kill her; so he slew her and threw her body into the
empty hoard-hole; but day overtook him and hindered him from
covering it up; he therefore took the money and went his way.
Now after a while the miller awoke and, missing his wife, went
into the mill, where he fastened the ass to the beam and shouted
to it. It went on a little, then stopped; whereupon he beat it
grievously; but the more he bashed it, the more it drew back;
for it was affrighted at the dead woman and could not go forward.
Thereupon the Miller, unknowing what hindered the donkey, took
out a knife and goaded it again and again, but still it would not
budge. Then he was wroth with it, knowing not the cause of its
obstinacy, and drove the knife into its flanks, and it fell down
dead. But when the sun rose, he saw his donkey lying dead and
likewise his wife in the place of the treasure, and great was his
rage and sore his wrath for the loss of his hoard and the death of
his wife and his ass. All this came of his letting his wife into his
secret and not keeping it to himself.<a id="r118"></a><a href="#f118" class="c011"><sup>[118]</sup></a> And I have heard this tale of</p>

<p class="c012">A certain simpleton was once walking along, haling his ass after
him by the halter, when a pair of sharpers saw him and one said
to his fellow, “I will take that ass from yonder wight.” Asked
the other, “How wilt thou do that?” “Follow me and I will
show thee how,” answered the first. So the cony-catcher went up
to the ass and, loosing it from the halter, gave the beast to his
fellow; then he haltered his own head and followed Tom Fool till
he knew the other had got clean off with the ass, when he stood
still. The oaf haled at the halter, but the rascal stirred not; so
he turned and seeing the halter on a man’s neck, said to him,
“What art thou?” Quoth the sharper, “I am thine ass and my
story is a wondrous one and ‘tis this. Know that I have a pious
old mother and came in to her one day, drunk; and she said to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>me:—O my son, repent to the Almighty of these thy transgressions.
But I took my staff and beat her, whereupon she cursed
me and Allah changed me into an ass and caused me fall into thy
hands, where I have remained till this moment. However, to-day,
my mother called me to mind and her heart yearned towards me;
so she prayed for me and the Lord restored me to my former
shape amongst the sons of Adam.” Cried the silly one, “There is
no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great! Allah upon thee, O my brother, acquit me of what I have
done with thee in the way of riding and so forth.” Then he let
the cony-catcher go and returned home, drunken with chagrin and
concern as with wine. His wife asked him, “What aileth thee
and where is the donkey?”; and he answered, “Thou knowest
not what was this ass; but I will tell thee.” So he told her the
story, and she exclaimed, “Alack and alas for the punishment we
shall receive from Almighty Allah! How could we have used a
man as a beast of burden, all this while?” And she gave alms
by way of atonement and prayed pardon of Heaven.<a id="r119"></a><a href="#f119" class="c011"><sup>[119]</sup></a> Then the
man abode awhile at home, idle and feckless, till she said to him,
“How long wilt thou sit at home doing naught? Go to the
market and buy us an ass and ply thy work with it.” Accordingly,

</div>

<p class="c012">The Caliph Harun al-Rashid went up one noontide to his couch,
to lie down; and mounting, found upon the bed-clothes semen
freshly emitted; whereat he was startled and troubled with sore
trouble. So he called the Lady Zubaydah and said to her,
“What is that spilt on the bed?” She looked at it and replied,
“O Commander of the Faithful, it is semen.” Quoth he, “Tell
me truly what this meaneth or I will lay violent hands on thee
forthright.” Quoth she, “By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,
indeed I know not how it came there and I am guiltless of that
whereof thou suspectest me.” So he sent for the Kazi Abú Yúsuf
and acquainted him of the case. The Judge raised his eyes to
the ceiling and, seeing a crack therein, said to the Caliph, “O
Commander of the Faithful, in very sooth the bat hath seed like
that of a man,<a id="r121"></a><a href="#f121" class="c011"><sup>[121]</sup></a> and this is bat’s semen.” Then he called for a
spear and thrust it into the crevice, whereupon down fell the bat.
In this manner the Caliph’s suspicions were dispelled——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

Kazi Abu Yusuf took the spear and thrust it into the crevice,
down fell the bat, and thus the Caliph’s suspicions were dispelled
and the innocence of Zubaydah was made manifest; whereat she
gave loud and liberal vent to her joy and promised Abu Yusuf
a magnificent reward. Now there were with her certain delicious
fruits, out of their season, and she knew of others in the garden;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>so she asked Abu Yusuf, “O Imam of the Faith, which wouldest
thou rather have of the two kinds of fruits, those that are here or
those that are not here?” And he answered, “Our code forbiddeth
us to pronounce judgment on the absent; wheneas they are present,
we will give our decision.” So she let bring the two kinds
of fruits before him; and he ate of both. Quoth she, “What is
the difference between them?” and quoth he, “As often as I
think to praise one kind, the adversary putteth in its claim.” The
Caliph laughed at his answer<a id="r122"></a><a href="#f122" class="c011"><sup>[122]</sup></a> and made him a rich present; and
Zubaydah also gave him what she had promised him, and he went

Jesus amuses himself with making birds of clay and commanding them to fly when

<p class="c012">The Caliph Al-Hákim bi-Amri’llah was riding out in state procession
one day, when he passed along a garden, wherein he saw
a man, surrounded by negro-slaves and eunuchs. He asked him
for a draught of water, and the man gave him to drink, saying,
“Belike, the Commander of the Faithful will honour me by alighting
in this my garden.” So the Caliph dismounted and with his
suite entered the garden; whereupon the said man brought out
to them an hundred rugs and an hundred leather mats and an
hundred cushions; and set before them an hundred dishes of
fruits, an hundred bowls of sweetmeats and an hundred jars of
sugared sherbets; at which the Caliph marvelled with much amaze
and said to his host, “O man, verily this thy case is wondrous:
didst thou know of our coming and make this preparation for
us?” He replied, “No, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,
I knew not of thy coming and I am a merchant of the rest of thy
subjects; but I have an hundred concubines; so, when the Commander
of the Faithful honoured me by alighting with me, I sent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>to each of them, bidding her send me her morning-meal in the
garden. So they sent me each of her furniture and the surplus of
her meat and drink: and every day each sendeth me a dish of
meat and another of cooling marinades, also a platter of fruits
and a bowl of sweetmeats and a jar of sherbet. This is my noonday
dinner, nor have I added aught thereto for thee.” Then the
Commander of the Faithful, Al-Hakim bi-Amri’llah prostrated
himself in thanksgiving to the Almighty (extolled and exalted be
His name!) and said, “Praised be Allah, who hath been so bountiful
to one of our lieges, that he entertaineth the Caliph and his
host, without making ready for them; nay, he feedeth them with
the surplusage of his day’s provision!” Then he sent for all the
dirhams in the treasury, that had been struck that year (and they
were in number three thousand and seven hundred thousand);

<p class="c012">The just King, Kisrà Anúshirwán one day rode forth to the
chase and, in pursuit of a deer, became separated from his suite.
Presently, he caught sight of a hamlet near hand and being sore
athirst, he made for it and presenting himself at the door of a
house that lay by the wayside, asked for a draught of water. So
a damsel came out and looked at him; then, going back into the
house, pressed the juice from a single sugar-cane into a bowl and
mixed it with water; after which she strewed on the top some
scented stuff, as it were dust, and carried it to the King. Thereupon
he seeing in it what resembled dust, drank it, little by little,
till he came to the end; when said he to her, “O damsel, the
drink is good, and how sweet it had been but for this dust in it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>that troubleth it.” Answered she, “O guest, I put in that powder
for a purpose;” and he asked, “And why didst thou thus?”; so
she replied, “I saw thee exceeding thirsty and feared that thou
wouldst drain the whole at one draught and that this would do
thee mischief; and but for this dust that troubled the drink so
hadst thou done.” The Just King wondered at her words, knowing
that they came of her wit and good sense, and said to her,
“From how many sugar canes didst thou express this draught?”
“One,” answered she; whereat Anushirwan marvelled and, calling
for the register of the village taxes, saw that its assessment was
but little and bethought him to increase it, on his return to his
palace, saying in himself, “A village where they get this much
juice out of one sugar-cane, why is it so lightly taxed?” He then
left the village and pursued his chase; and, as he came back at
the end of the day, he passed alone by the same door and called
again for drink; whereupon the same damsel came out and,
knowing him at a look, went in to fetch him water. It was some
time before she returned and Anushirwan wondered thereat and
said to her, “Why hast thou tarried?”——And Shahrazad perceived

enough for thy need; so I pressed three; but they yielded not so
much as did one before.” Rejoined he, “What is the cause of
that?”; and she replied, “The cause of it is that when the

from his mind that which he had purposed against the
villagers. Moreover, he took the damsel to wife then and there,
being pleased with her much wit and acuteness and the excellence
of her speech. And they tell another tale of the</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, in the city of Bokhara, a water-carrier, who
used to carry water to the house of a goldsmith and had done this
thirty years. Now that goldsmith had a wife of exceeding beauty
and loveliness, brilliancy and perfect grace; and she was withal
renowned for piety, chastity and modesty. One day the water-carrier
came, as of custom, and poured the water into the cisterns.
Now the woman was standing in the midst of the court; so he
went close up to her and taking her hand, stroked it and pressed
it, then went away and left her. When her husband came home
from the bazar, she said to him, “I would have thee tell me what
thing thou hast done in the market this day, to anger Almighty
Allah.” Quoth he, “I have done nothing to offend the Lord.”
“Nay,” rejoined she, “but, by Allah, thou hast indeed done something
to anger Him; and, unless thou tell me the whole truth, I
will not abide in thy house, and thou shalt not see me, nor will
I see thee.” So he confessed, “I will tell thee the truth of what
I did this day. It so chanced that, as I was sitting in my shop,
as of wont, a woman came up to me and bade me make her a
bracelet of gold. Then she went away and I wrought her a
bracelet and laid it aside. But when she returned and I brought
her out the bracelet, she put forth her hand and I clasped the
bracelet on her wrist; and I wondered at the whiteness of her
hand and the beauty of her wrist, which would captivate any
beholder; and I recalled what the poet saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Her fore-arms, dight with their bangles, show ✿ Like fire ablaze on the waves a-flow;</div>
      <div class="line">As by purest gold were the water girt, ✿ And belted around by a living lowe.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So I took her hand and pressed it and squeezed it.” Said the
woman, “Great God! Why didst thou this ill thing? Know that
the water-carrier, who hath come to our house these thirty years,
nor sawst thou ever any treason in him, took my hand this day
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>and pressed and squeezed it.” Said her husband, “O woman,
let us crave pardon of Allah! Verily, I repent of what I did,
and do thou ask forgiveness of the Lord for me.” She cried,
“Allah pardon me and thee, and receive us into his holy
keeping.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the goldsmith’s
wife cried out, “Allah pardon me and thee, and receive
us into his holy keeping!” And on the next day, the water-carrier
came in to the jeweller’s wife and, throwing himself at
her feet, grovelled in the dust and besought pardon of her,
saying, “O my lady, acquit me of that which Satan deluded
me to do; for it was he that seduced me and led me astray.”
She answered, “Go thy ways, the sin was not in thee, but in
my husband, for that he did what he did in his shop, and Allah
hath retaliated upon him in this world.” And it is related that
the goldsmith, when his wife told him how the water-carrier
had used her, said, “Tit for tat, and blow for blow!; had I done
more the water-carrier had done mo’e”;—which became a current
byword among the folk. Therefore it behoveth a wife to be both
outward and inward with her husband; contenting herself with
little from him, if he cannot give her much, and taking pattern
by Ayishah the Truthful and Fatimah the virgin mother (Allah
Almighty accept of them twain!), that she may be of the company
of the righteous ancestry.<a id="r127"></a><a href="#f127" class="c011"><sup>[127]</sup></a> And I have heard the following

classics (Pausanias), who made Juno recover her virginity by bathing in a certain river
every year. In the last phrase, “Al-Salaf” (ancestry) refers to Mohammed and his

</div>

<p class="c012">King Khusrau<a id="r128"></a><a href="#f128" class="c011"><sup>[128]</sup></a> Shahinshah of Persia loved fish; and one
day, as he sat in his saloon, he and Shirin his wife, there came
a fisherman, with a great fish, and he laid it before the King,
who was pleased and ordered the man four thousand dirhams.<a id="r129"></a><a href="#f129" class="c011"><sup>[129]</sup></a>
Thereupon Shirin said to the King, “Thou hast done ill.” Asked
he, “And why?”, and she answered, “Because if, after this, thou
give one of thy courtiers a like sum, he will disdain it and say:—He
hath but given me the like of what he gave the fisherman.
And if thou give him less, the same will say:—He despiseth
me and giveth me less than he gave the fisherman.” Rejoined
Khusrau, “Thou art right, but it would dishonour a king to go
back on his gift; and the thing is done.” Quoth Shirin, “If
thou wilt, I will contrive thee a means to get it back from him.”
Quoth he, “How so?”; and she said, “Call back, if thou so please,
the fisherman and ask him if the fish be male or female. If he
say, Male, say thou, We want a female, and if he say, Female,
say, We want a male.” So the King sent for the fisherman, who
was a man of wit and acuteness, and said to him, “Is this fish
male or female?” whereupon the fisherman kissed the ground
and answered, “This fish is an hermaphrodite,<a id="r130"></a><a href="#f130" class="c011"><sup>[130]</sup></a> neither male nor
female.” Khusrau laughed at his clever reply and ordered him
other four thousand dirhams. So the fisherman went to the
treasurer and, taking his eight thousand dirhams, put them in a
sack he had with him. Then, throwing it over his shoulder, he
was going away, when he dropped a dirham; so he laid the bag
off his back and stooped down to pick it up. Now the King
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>and Shirin were looking on, and the Queen said, “O King, didst
thou note the meanness of the man, in that he must needs stoop
down to pick up the one dirham, and could not bring himself to
leave it for any of the King’s servants?” When the King heard
these words, he was exceeding wroth with the fisherman and
said, “Thou art right, O Shirin!” So he called the man back
and said to him, “Thou low-minded carle! Thou art no man!
How couldst thou put the bag with all this money off thy
back and bend thee groundwards to pick up the one dirham
and grudge to leave it where it fell?” Thereupon the fisherman
kissed the earth before him and answered, “May Allah prolong
the King’s life! Indeed, I did not pick up the dirham off the
ground because of its value in my eyes; but I raised it off the
earth because on one of its faces is the likeness of the King and
on the other his name; and I feared lest any should unwittingly
set foot upon it, thus dishonouring the name and presentment of
the King, and I be blamed for this offence.” The King wondered
at his words and approved of his wit and shrewdness, and ordered
him yet other four thousand dirhams. Moreover, he bade cry
abroad in his kingdom, saying, “It behoveth none to be guided
by women’s counsel; for whoso followeth their advice, loseth,
with his one dirham, other twain.”<a id="r131"></a><a href="#f131" class="c011"><sup>[131]</sup></a> And here is the tale they

invite Ja’afar; and when he came, he set wine before him and
made the girl sing to him, from behind the curtain. Ja’afar knew
her voice and was angered at this, but, of the nobleness of his
nature and the magnanimity of his mind he showed no change.
Now when the carousal was at an end, Al-Amin commanded one
of his servants to fill the boat, wherein Ja’afar had come, with
dirhams and dinars and all manner of jewels and jacinths and rich
raiment and goods galore. So he laid therein a thousand myriads
of money and a thousand fine pearls, each worth twenty thousand
dirhams; nor did he give over loading the barge with all manner
of things precious and rare, till the boatmen cried out for help,
saying, “The boat can’t hold any more;” whereupon he bade them
carry all this to Ja’afar’s palace. Such are the exploits of the
magnanimous, Allah have mercy on them! And a tale is related

I was at my wits’ end what to do, for my doors were
blocked up with creditors and I was without cease importuned for

sore perplexed and troubled. So I betook myself to Abdallah bin

</div>

<p class="c012">There was in times of yore and in ages long gone before, a
virtuous woman among the children of Israel, who was pious and
devout and used every day to go out to the place of prayer, first
entering a garden, which adjoined thereto, and there making the
minor ablution. Now there were in this garden two old men, its
keepers, and both Shaykhs fell in love with her and sought her
favours; but she refused, whereupon said they, “Unless thou yield
thy body to us, we will bear witness against thee of fornication.”
Quoth she, “Allah will preserve me from your frowardness!”
Then they opened the garden-gate and cried out, and the folk
came to them from all places, saying “What aileth you?” Quoth
they, “We found this damsel in company with a youth who was
doing lewdness with her; but he escaped from our hands.” Now
it was the wont of the people of those days to expose adulterer
and adulteress to public reproach for three days, and after stone
them. So they cried her name in the public streets for three days,
whilst the two elders came up to her daily and, laying their hands
on her head, said, “Praised be Allah who hath sent down on thee
His righteous indignation!” Now on the fourth day, when they
bore her away to stone her, they were followed by a lad named
Daniel, who was then only twelve years old, and this was to be the
first of his miracles (upon our Prophet and upon him be blessing
and peace!). And he ceased not following them to the place of
execution, till he came up with them and said to them, “Hasten
not to stone her, till I judge between them.” So they set him a
chair and he sat down and summoned the old men separately.
(Now he was the first ever separated witnesses.) Then said he to
the first, “What sawest thou?”<a id="r139"></a><a href="#f139" class="c011"><sup>[139]</sup></a> So he repeated to him his story,
and Daniel asked, “In what part of the garden did this befal?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>and he answered, “On the eastern side, under a pear-tree.” Then he
called the other old man and asked him the same question, and he
replied, “On the western side of the garden, under an apple-tree.”
Meanwhile the damsel stood by, with her hands and eyes raised
heavenwards, imploring the Lord for deliverance. Then Allah
Almighty sent down His blasting leven-fire upon the elders and
consumed them, and on this wise the Lord made manifest the
innocence of the damsel. Such was the first of the miracles of
the Prophet Daniel, on whom be blessing and peace! And they
relate a tale of</p>

“From Bassorah.” Quoth Ja’afar, “And whither goest thou?”
Quoth the other, “To Baghdad.” Then Ja’afar enquired “And
what wilt thou do there?” and the old man replied, “I go to seek

sport with him,” and answered Ja’afar, “I shall hear what I shall
exceedingly mislike.<a id="r141"></a><a href="#f141" class="c011"><sup>[141]</sup></a>” But Al-Rashid rejoined, “I charge thee
on my authority, jest with him.” Thereupon Ja’afar said to the
Badawi, “If I prescribe thee a medicine that shall profit thee,
what wilt thou give me in return?” Quoth the other, “Allah
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>Almighty will requite the kindness with what is better for thee
than any requital of mine.” Continued Ja’afar, “Now lend me
an ear and I will give thee a prescription, which I have given to
none but thee.” “What is that?” asked the Badawi; and Ja’afar
answered, “Take three ounces of wind-breaths and the like of
sunbeams and the same of moonshine and as much of lamp-light;
mix them well together and let them lie in the wind three months.
Then place them three months in a mortar without a bottom and
pound them to fine powder and after trituration set them in a cleft
platter, and let it stand in the wind other three months; after
which use of this medicine three drachms every night in thy sleep,
and, Inshallah! thou shalt be healed and whole.” Now when the
Badawi heard this, he stretched himself out to full length on the
donkey’s back and let fly a terrible loud fart<a id="r142"></a><a href="#f142" class="c011"><sup>[142]</sup></a> and said to Ja’afar,
“Take this fart in payment of thy prescription. When I have
followed it, if Allah grant me recovery, I will give thee a slave-girl,
who shall serve thee in thy lifetime a service, wherewith Allah
shall cut short thy term; and when thou diest and the Lord

wherefore we demand of thee the retribution of his crime and call

youth and said to him, “Verily thou hearest the complaint these
two young men prefer; what hast thou in reply to aver?” But
<span class="pageno" id="Page_100">100</span>he was brave of heart and bold of speech, having doffed the robe
of pusillanimity and put off the garb of cowardry; so he smiled
and spake in the most eloquent and elegant words; and, after
paying the usual ceremonial compliment to the Caliph, said, “By
Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I have indeed given ear to
their complaint, and they have told the truth in that which they
tell, so far as they have set out what befel; and the commandment
of Allah is a decreed decree.<a id="r146"></a><a href="#f146" class="c011"><sup>[146]</sup></a> But I will forthright state my case

up in the dwellings of the wold and fell, till evil times my tribe
befel, when I came to the outskirts of this town, with my family
and whatso goods I own: and as I went along one of the paths
leading to its gardens, orchards and garths, with my she-camels
highly esteemed and by me most precious deemed, and midst
them a stallion of noble blood and shape right good, a plenteous
getter of brood, by whom the females abundantly bore and who
walked among them as though a kingly crown he wore, one of the
she-camels broke away; and, running to the garden of these
young men’s father, where the trees showed above the wall, put
forth her lips and began to feed as in stall. I ran to her, to drive
her away, when behold, there appeared, at a breach of the wall, an
old man and grey, whose eyes sparkled with angry ray, holding in
his right a stone to throw and swaying to and fro, with a swing
like a lion ready for a spring. He cast the stone at my stallion,
and it killed him for it struck a vital part. When I saw the
stallion drop dead beside me, I felt live coals of anger kindled in
my heart; so I took up the very same stone and throwing it at the
old man, it was the cause of his bane and ban: thus his own
wrongful act returned to him anew, and the man was slain of that
wherewith he slew. When the stone struck him, he cried out
with a great cry and shrieked out a terrible shriek, whereupon
I hastened from the spot; but these two young men hurried after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>me and laid hands on me and before thee carried me.” Quoth
Omar (Almighty Allah accept of him!), “Thou hast confessed
what thou committedest, and of acquittal there is no possible
occasion; for urgent is the law of retaliation and they cried for
mercy but it was not a time to escape.”<a id="r148"></a><a href="#f148" class="c011"><sup>[148]</sup></a> The youth answered,
“I hear and obey the judgment of the Imam, and I consent
to all required by the law of Al-Islam; but I have a young
brother, whose old father, before his decease, appointed to him
wealth in great store and gold galore, and committed his affair
to me before Allah, saying:—I give this into thy hand for thy
brother; keep it for him with all thy might. So I took the
money and buried it; nor doth any know of it but I. Now, if
thou adjudge me to be justiced forthright, the money will be lost
and thou shalt be the cause of its loss; wherefore the child will
sue thee for his due on the day when the Creator shall judge
between His creatures. But, if thou wilt grant me three days’
delay, I will appoint some guardian to administer the affairs of
the boy and return to answer my debt; and I have one who will
be my surety for the fulfilment of this my promise.” So the
Commander of the Faithful bowed his head awhile, then raised
it and looking round upon those present, said, “Who will stand
surety by me for his return to this place?” And the youth looked
at the faces of those who were in company and pointing to Abu
Zarr,<a id="r149"></a><a href="#f149" class="c011"><sup>[149]</sup></a> in preference to all present, said, “This man shall answer
for me and be my bail.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
youth pointed to Abu Zarr and said, “This man shall answer for
me and be my bail,” Omar (Allah accept of him!) said, “O Abu
Zarr, dost thou hear these words and wilt thou be surety to me for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>the return of this youth?” He answered, “Yes, O Commander
of the Faithful, I will be surety for him three days.” So the
Caliph accepted his guarantee and let the young man go. Now
when the appointed time passed and the days of grace were nearly
or quite at end yet the youth came not, the Caliph took seat in his
council, with the Companions surrounding him, like the constellations
about the moon, Abu Zarr and the plaintiffs being also present;
and the avengers said, “Where is the defendant, O Abu
Zarr, and how shall he return, having once fled? But we will not
stir from our places till thou bring him to us, that we may take of
him our blood-revenge.” Replied Abu Zarr, “By the truth of the
All-Wise King, if the three days of grace expire and the young
man return not, I will fulfil my warranty and surrender my person
to the Imam;” and added Omar (whom Allah accept!), “By the
Lord, if the young man appear not, I will assuredly execute on
Abu Zarr that which is prescribed by the law of Al-Islam!”<a id="r150"></a><a href="#f150" class="c011"><sup>[150]</sup></a>
Thereupon the eyes of the bystanders ran over with tears; those
who looked on groaned aloud and great was the clamour. Then the
chiefs of the Companions urged the plaintiffs to accept the blood-wit
and deserve the thanks of the folk; but they both refused and
would accept nothing save the talion. However, as the folk were
swaying to and fro like waves and loudly bemoaning Abu Zarr,
behold, up came the young Badawi; and, standing before the
Imam, saluted him right courteously (with sweat-beaded face and
shining with the crescent’s grace) and said to him, “I have given
the lad in charge to his mother’s brothers and have made them
acquainted with all that pertaineth to his affairs and let them into
the secret of his monies; after which I braved the heats of noon
and have kept my word as a free-born man.” Thereupon the folk
marvelled, seeing his good faith and loyalty and his offering himself
to death with so stout a heart; and one said to him, “How
noble a youth art thou and how loyal to thy word of honour and
thy devoir!” Rejoined he, “Are ye not convinced that when
death presenteth itself, none can escape from it? And indeed, I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>have kept my word, that it be not said, Good faith is gone from
among mankind.” Said Abu Zarr, “By Allah, O Commander of
the Faithful, I became warrant for this young man, without knowing
to what tribe he belonged, nor had I seen him before that day;
but, when he turned away from all who were present and singled
me out, saying:—This man shall answer for me and be my bail, I
thought it not right to refuse him, and generosity forbade to disappoint
his desire, there being no harm in compliance therewith,
that it be not bruited abroad, Benevolence is gone from among
mankind.” Then said the two young men, “O Commander of the
Faithful, we forgive this youth our father’s blood, seeing that he
hath changed desolation into cheerfulness; that it be not said,
Humanity is gone from among mankind.” So the Caliph rejoiced
in the acquittance of the youth and his truth and good faith;
moreover, he magnified the generosity of Abu Zarr, extolling it
over all his companions, and approved the resolve of the two
young men for its benevolence, giving them praise with thanks
and applying to their case the saying of the poet:—</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">It is told that the Caliph-al-Maamun son of Harun al-Rashid,
when he entered the God-guarded city of Cairo, was minded to
pull down the Pyramids, that he might take what was therein;
but, when he went about to do this, he could not succeed, albeit
his best was done. He expended a mint of money in the attempt,——And

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Al-Maamun
attempting to pull down the Pyramids, expended his mint of
money, but succeeded only in opening up a small tunnel in one of
them, wherein it is said he found treasure to the exact amount of
the monies he had spent in the works, neither more nor less;
whereat he marvelled and taking what he found there, desisted
from his determination. Now the Pyramids are three, and they
are one of the Wonders of the World; nor is there on the face of
earth aught like them for height and fashion and mysteries<a id="r154"></a><a href="#f154" class="c011"><sup>[154]</sup></a>; for
they are built of huge rocks, and the builders proceeded by piercing
one block of stone and setting therein upright rods of iron<a id="r155"></a><a href="#f155" class="c011"><sup>[155]</sup></a>;
after which they pierced a second block of stone and lowered it
upon the first. Then they poured melted lead upon the clamps
and set the blocks in geometrical order, till the building was
complete. Now the height of each pyramid was an hundred
<span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>cubits, of the normal measure of the day, and it had four faces,
each three hundred cubits long from the base and thence battering
upwards to a point. The ancients say that, in the western
Pyramid, are thirty chambers of parti-coloured syenite, full of
precious gems and treasures galore and rare images and utensils
and costly weapons which are anointed with egromantic unguents,
so that they may not rust till the day of Resurrection.<a id="r156"></a><a href="#f156" class="c011"><sup>[156]</sup></a> Therein,
also, are vessels of glass which bend and break not, containing
various kinds of compound drugs and sympathetic waters. In
the second Pyramid are the records of the priests, written on
tablets of syenite, to each priest his tablet, whereon are engraved
the wonders of his craft and his feats; and on the walls are
human figures like idols, working with their hands at all manner
of mechanism and seated on stepped thrones. Moreover, to each
Pyramid there is a guardian treasurer who keepeth watch over it
and wardeth it, to all eternity, against the ravages of time and the
shifts of events; and indeed the marvels of these Pyramids
astound all who have sight and insight. Many are the poems that

boring through the blocks as Artesian wells are driven. I cannot divine why Lane (ii.

suggesting a comparison between Mediæval Moslem superstitions and those of our
xixth Century, which to our descendants will appear as wild, if not as picturesque, as
those of The Nights. The “inspired British inch” and the building by Melchisedek
(the Shaykh of some petty Syrian village) will compare not unaptly with the enchanted
swords, flexible glass and guardian spirits. But the Pyramidennarren is a race which
will not speedily die out: it is based on Nature, the Pyramids themselves.</p>

  <h2 id="c107" class="c007">THE THIEF AND THE MERCHANT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once a thief who repented to Almighty Allah with
sincere penitence; so he opened himself a shop for the sale of
stuffs, where he continued to trade awhile. It so chanced one day
that he locked his shop and went home, and in the night there
came to the bazar an artful thief disguised in the habit of the
merchant, and pulling out keys from his sleeve, said to the watchman
of the market, “Light me this wax-candle.” The watchman
took the taper and went to light it,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the watchman
took the taper and went to light it, whilst the thief opened
the shop and lit another candle he had by him. When the watchman
came back, he found him seated in the shop, account-books
in hand, and reckoning with his fingers; nor did he cease to do
thus till point of day, when he said to the man, “Fetch me a
camel-driver and his camel, to carry some goods for me.” So the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>man fetched him a camel, and the thief took four bales<a id="r157"></a><a href="#f157" class="c011"><sup>[157]</sup></a> of stuffs
and gave them to the cameleer, who loaded them on his beast.
Then he gave the watchman two dirhams and went away after the
camel-driver, leaving the watchman believing him to be the owner
of the shop. Now when the morning dawned and day broke
the merchant came and the watchman began greeting him with
blessings, because of the two dirhams; but the shop-owner
wondered at his words as one not knowing what he meant.
When he opened his shop, he saw the droppings of the wax
and the account book lying on the floor, and looking round,
found four bales of stuffs missing. So he asked the watchman
what had happened and he told him what had passed in the
night and what had been said to the cameleer, whereupon the
merchant bade him fetch the man and asked him, “Whither
didst thou carry the stuffs this morning?” Answered the driver,
“To such a landing-place, and I stowed them on board such a
vessel.” Said the merchant, “Come with me thither;” so the
camel-driver carried him to the landing-place and said to him,
“This be the barque and this be her owner.” Quoth the
merchant to the seaman, “Whither didst thou carry the merchant
and the stuff?” Answered the boat-master, “To such a place,
where he fetched a camel-driver and, setting the bales on the
camel, went his ways I know not whither.” “Fetch me the
cameleer who carried the goods,” said the merchant; so he
fetched him and the merchant said to him, “Whither didst thou
carry the bales of stuffs from the ship?” “To such a Khan,”
answered he; and the merchant rejoined, “Come thither with
me and show it me.” So the camel-man went with him to a
place far distant from the shore and showed him the Khan
where he had set down the stuffs, and at the same time the
false merchant’s magazine, which he opened and found therein
his four bales bound up as they had been packed. The thief
had laid his cloak over them; so the merchant took the cloak
as well as the bales and delivered them to the camel-driver, who
laid them on his camel; after which he locked the magazine and
went away with the cameleer. On the way, behold, he was
confronted by the thief who followed him, till he had shipped
the bales, when he said to him, “O my brother (Allah have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>thee in His holy keeping!), thou hast indeed recovered thy goods
and naught of them is lost; so give me back my cloak.” The
merchant laughed and, giving him back his cloak, let him go
unhindered; whereupon both went their ways. And they tell a

</div>

<p class="c012">The Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, was exceedingly
restless one night; so he said to his Wazir Ja’afar, “I am
sleep-less to-night and my breast is straitened and I know not
what to do.” Now his castrato Masrúr was standing before him,
and he laughed; whereupon the Caliph said “At whom laughest
thou? is it to make mock of me or hath madness seized thee?”
Answered Masrur, “Nay, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Harun
al-Rashid said to Masrur the Sworder, “Dost thou laugh to
make mock of me or hath madness seized thee?” Answered
Masrur, “Nay, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I swear
by thy kinship to the Prince of Apostles, I did it not of my free
will; but I went out yesterday to walk within sight of the palace
and, coming to the bank of the Tigris, saw there the folk
collected; so I stopped and found a man, Ibn al-Káribí hight,
who was making them laugh; but just now I recalled what he
said, and laughter got the better of me; and I crave pardon
of thee, O Commander of the Faithful!” Quoth the Caliph,
“Bring him to me forthright;” so Masrur repaired in all haste
to Ibn al-Karibi and said to him, “Answer the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful,” whereto he replied, “I hear and
obey.” “But on condition,” added Masrur, “that, if he give
thee aught, thou shalt have a quarter and the rest shall be
mine.” Replied the droll, “Nay, thou shalt have half and I
half.” Rejoined Masrur, “Not so, I will have three-quarters.”
Lastly said Ibn al-Karibi, “Thou shalt have two-thirds and I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>the other third;” to which Masrur agreed, after much higgling
and haggling, and they returned to the palace together. Now
when Ibn al-Karibi came into the Caliph’s presence he saluted
him as men greet the Caliphate, and stood before him; whereupon
said Al-Rashid to him, “If thou do not make me laugh,
I will give thee three blows with this bag.” Quoth Ibn al-Karibi
in his mind, “And a small matter were blows with that bag,
seeing that beating with whips hurteth me not;” for he thought
the bag was empty. Then he began to deal out his drolleries,
such as would make the dismallest jemmy guffaw, and gave vent
to all manner of buffooneries; but the Caliph laughed not neither
smiled, whereat Ibn al-Karibi marvelled and was chagrined and
affrighted. Then said the Commander of the Faithful, “Now
hast thou earned the beating,” and gave him a blow with the
bag, wherein were four pebbles each two rotols in weight. The
blow fell on his neck and he gave a great cry, then calling to
mind his compact with Masrur, said, “Pardon, O Commander
of the Faithful! Hear two words from me.” Quoth the Caliph,
“Say on,” and quoth Ibn al-Karibi, “Masrur made it a condition
with me and I a covenant with him, that whatsoever largesse
might come to me of the bounties of the Commander of the
Faithful, one-third thereof should be mine and the rest his; nor
did he agree to leave me so much as one-third, save after much
higgling and haggling. Now thou hast bestowed on me nothing
but beating; I have had my share and here standeth he, ready
to receive his portion; so pay him the two other blows.” Now
when the Caliph heard this, he laughed till he fell on his back;
then calling Masrur, he gave him a blow, whereat he cried out
and said, “O Commander of the Faithful, the one-third sufficeth
me: give him the two-thirds.”——And Shahrazad perceived the

  <h2 id="c111" class="c007">THE DEVOTEE PRINCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, had a son
who, from the time he attained the age of sixteen, renounced the
world and walked in the way<a id="r158"></a><a href="#f158" class="c011"><sup>[158]</sup></a> of ascetics and devotees. He was
wont to go out to the grave-yards and say, “Ye once ruled the
world, but that saved you not from death, and now are ye come to
your sepulchres! Would Heaven I knew what ye said and what
is said to you!”<a id="r159"></a><a href="#f159" class="c011"><sup>[159]</sup></a> And he wept as one weepeth who is troubled
with fear and apprehension, and repeated the words of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Affright me funerals at every time; ✿ And wailing women grieve me to the soul!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now it chanced one day, as he sat among the tombs, according to
his custom, his father passed by in all his state, surrounded by his
Wazirs and Lords of the realm and the Officers of his household,
who seeing the Caliph’s son with a gown of woollen stuff on his
body and a twist of wool on his head by way of turband, said to
one another, “Verily this youth dishonoureth the Commander of
the Faithful among Kings: but, if he reproved him, he would
leave his present way of life.” The Caliph heard these words;
so quoth he to his son, “O my dear child, of a truth thou disgracest
me by thy present way of life.” The young man looked
at him and made no reply: then he beckoned to a bird perched
on the battlements of the palace, and said to it, “O thou bird, I
conjure thee by Him who created thee, alight upon my hand.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>Whereupon straightway it swooped down and perched on his
finger. Then quoth he, “Return to thy place;” and it did so.
Presently he said, “Alight on the hand of the Commander of the
Faithful;” but it refused there to perch, and he cried to his father,
“It is thou that disgracest me amongst the Holy<a id="r160"></a><a href="#f160" class="c011"><sup>[160]</sup></a> Ones, by the
love of the world; and now I am resolved to part from thee, never
to return to thee, save in the world to come.” Then he went
down to Bassorah, where he took to working with those which
wrought in clay,<a id="r161"></a><a href="#f161" class="c011"><sup>[161]</sup></a> receiving, as his day’s hire, but a dirham and a
dánik;<a id="r162"></a><a href="#f162" class="c011"><sup>[162]</sup></a> and with the danik he fed himself and gave alms of the
dirham. (Quoth Abú Amir of Bassorah) There fell down a wall
in my house: so I went forth to the station of the artisans to find
a man who should repair it for me, and my eyes fell on a handsome
youth of a radiant countenance. So I saluted him and asked him,
“O my friend, dost thou seek work?” “Yes,” answered he; and
I said, “Come with me and build a wall.” He replied, “On certain
conditions I will make with thee.” Quoth I “What are they, O
my friend?”; and quoth he, “My wage must be a dirham and a
danik, and again when the Mu’ezzin calleth to prayer, thou shalt
let me go pray with the congregation.” “It is well,” answered I
and carried him to my place, where he fell to work, such work as I
never saw the like of. Presently, I named to him the morning-meal;
but he said, “No;” and I knew that he was fasting.<a id="r163"></a><a href="#f163" class="c011"><sup>[163]</sup></a> When
he heard the call to prayer, he said to me, “Thou knowest the
condition?” “Yes,” answered I. So he loosed his girdle and,
applying himself to the lesser ablution, made it after a fashion
than which I never saw a fairer;<a id="r164"></a><a href="#f164" class="c011"><sup>[164]</sup></a> then he went to the mosque and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>prayed with the congregation and returned to his work. He did
the same upon the call to mid-afternoon prayer, and when I saw
him fall to work again thereafterward, I said to him, “O my friend,
verily the hours of labour are over; a workman’s day is but till the
time of afternoon-prayer.” But he replied, “Praise to the Lord,
my service is till the night.” And he ceased not to work till
nightfall, when I gave him two dirhams; whereupon he asked
“What is this!”; and I answered, “By Allah, this is but part of
thy wage, because of thy diligence in my service.” But he threw
them back to me saying, “I will have no more than was agreed
upon between us twain.” I urged him to take them, but could
not prevail upon him; so I gave him the dirham and the danik,
and he went away. And when morning dawned, I went to the
station but found him not; so I enquired for him and was told,
“He cometh thither only on Sabbaths.” Accordingly, when
Saturday came, I betook me to the market and finding him there,
said to him, “Bismillah, do me the favour to come and work for
me.” Said he, “Upon the conditions thou wottest;” and I answered
“Yes!” Then carrying him to my house I stood to watch him
where he could not see me; and he took a handful of puddled clay
and laid it on the wall, when, behold, the stones ranged themselves
one upon other; and I said, “On this wise are Allah’s
holy ones.” He worked out his day and did even more than
before; and when it was night, I gave him his hire, and he took
it and walked away. Now when the third Saturday came round,
I went to the place of standing, but found him not; so I asked
after him and they told me, “He is sick and lying in the shanty
of such a woman.” Now this was an old wife, renowned for piety,
who had a hovel of reeds in the burial-ground. So I fared thither
and found him stretched on the floor which was bare, with a brick
for a pillow and his face beaming like the new moon with light.
I saluted him and he returned my salam; and I sat down at his
head weeping over his fair young years and absence from home
and submission to the will of his Lord. Then said I to him,
“Hast thou any need?” “Yes,” answered he; and I said, “What
is it?” He replied, “Come hither to-morrow in the forenoon and
thou wilt find me dead. Wash me and dig my grave and tell none
thereof: but shroud me in this my gown, after thou hast unsewn
it and taken out what thou shalt find in the bosom-pocket, which
keep with thee. Then, when thou hast prayed over me and laid
<span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>me in the dust, go to Baghdad and watch for the Caliph Harun
al-Rashid, till he come forth, when do thou give him what thou
shalt find in the breast of my gown and bear him my salutation.”
Then he ejaculated the profession of the Faith and glorified his
God in the most eloquent of words reciting these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Carry the trust of him whom death awaits ✿ To Al-Rashid, and God reward thy care!</div>
      <div class="line">And say, “An exile who desired thy sight ✿ Long loving, from afar sends greeting fair.</div>
      <div class="line">Nor hate nor irk (No!) him from thee withdrew, ✿ Kissing thy right to Heaven brought him near.<a id="r165"></a><a href="#f165" class="c011"><sup>[165]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">But what estranged his soul, O sire, from thee ✿ Is that thy worldly joys it would not share!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he betook himself to prayer, asking pardon of Allah——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the youth
then betook himself to asking pardon of Allah and to invoking
prayer and praise upon the Apostle and the Lord of the Just and
repeating verses of the Koran; after which he recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O sire, be not deceived by worldly joys; ✿ For life must pass, and joy must learn to mourn;</div>

      <div class="line">And when thou bear thy dead toward the tombs, ✿ Know thou wilt likewise on that way be borne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(Continued Abu Amir the Basri) Now when the youth had ended
his charge and his verses I left him and went home. On the
morrow, I returned, at the appointed hour, and found him indeed
dead, the mercy of Allah be upon him! So I washed him and,
unsewing his gown, found in the bosom a ruby worth thousands of
gold pieces and said to myself, “By Allah, this youth was indeed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>weaned from worldly things!” After I had buried him, I made
my way to Baghdad and, going to the Caliph’s palace, waited till
he came forth, when I addressed him in one of the streets and
gave him the ruby, which when he saw, he knew and fell down in
a fainting-fit. His attendants laid hands on me, but he revived
and said to them, “Release him and bring him courteously to the
palace.” They did his bidding, and when he returned, he sent
for me and carrying me into his chamber said to me, “How doth
the owner of this ruby?” Quoth I, “Verily he is dead;” and
told him what had passed; whereupon he fell a-weeping and said,
“The son hath gained; but the sire hath lost.” Then he called
out, saying, “Ho, such an one!”; and behold, there came out to
him a lady who, when she saw me, would have withdrawn; but he
cried to her, “Come; and mind him not.” So she entered and
saluted, and he threw her the ruby, which when she saw and she
knew, she shrieked a great shriek and fell down in a swoon. As
soon as she came to herself, she said, “O Commander of the
Faithful, what hath Allah done with my son?”; and he said to
me, “Do thou tell her his case;” (as he could not speak for
weeping). Accordingly, I repeated the story to her, and she began
to shed tears and say in a faint and failing voice, “How I have
longed for thy sight, O solace of mine eyes!<a id="r166"></a><a href="#f166" class="c011"><sup>[166]</sup></a> Would I might have
given thee to drink, when thou hadst none to slake thy thirst!
Would I might have cheered thee, whenas thou foundest never a
cheerer!” And she poured forth tears and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth I, “O Commander of the Faithful, was he indeed thy
<span class="pageno" id="Page_115">115</span>son?” Quoth he, “Yes, and indeed, before I succeeded to this
office, he was wont to visit the learned and company with the
devout; but, when I became Caliph, he grew estranged from me
and withdrew himself apart.<a id="r168"></a><a href="#f168" class="c011"><sup>[168]</sup></a> Then said I to his mother, Verily
this thy son hath cut the world and devoted his life to Almighty
Allah, and it may be that hard times shall befal him and he be
smitten with trial of evil chance; wherefore do thou give him this
ruby, which he may find useful in hour of need. So she gave it
him, conjuring him to take it, and he obeyed her bidding. Then
he left to us the things of our world and removed himself from us;
nor did he cease to be absent from us, till he went to the presence
of Allah (to whom be Honour and Glory!), pious and pure.”
Then said he, “Come, show me his grave.” So, I travelled with
him to Bassorah and showed him his son’s grave; and when he
saw it, he wept and lamented, till he fell down in a swoon; after
which he recovered and asked pardon of the Lord, saying, “We
are Allah’s and unto Him we are returning!”; and invoked
blessings on the dead. Then he asked me to become his companion,
but I said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful, verily,
in thy son’s case is for me the most momentous of admonitions!”
And I recited these couplets:—</p>

  <h2 id="c117" class="c007">THE UNWISE SCHOOLMASTER WHO FELL IN LOVE BY REPORT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">(Quoth one of the learned) I passed once by a school, wherein a
schoolmaster was teaching children; so I entered, finding him a
good-looking man and a well-dressed; when he rose to me and
made me sit with him. Then I examined him in the Koran and in
syntax and prosody and lexicography; and behold, he was perfect
in all required of him, so I said to him, “Allah strengthen thy
purpose! Thou art indeed versed in all that is requisite.”
Thereafter I frequented him a while, discovering daily some new
excellence in him, and quoth I to myself, “This is indeed a wonder
in any dominie; for the wise are agreed upon a lack of wit in
children’s teachers.” Then I separated myself from him and
sought him and visited him only every few days, till coming to
see him one day as of wont, I found the school shut and made
enquiry of his neighbours, who replied, “Some one is dead in his
house.” So I said in my mind, “It behoveth me to pay him a
visit of condolence,” and going to his house, knocked at the door,
when a slave-girl came out to me and asked, “What dost thou
want?” and I answered, “I want thy master.” She replied,
“He is sitting alone, mourning;” and I rejoined, “Tell him that
his friend so and so seeketh to console him.” She went in and
told him; and he said, “Admit him.” So she brought me in to
him, and I found him seated alone and his head bound with
mourning fillets. So I said to him, “Allah requite thee amply!
this is a path all must perforce tread, and it behoveth thee to take
patience;” adding, “But who is dead unto thee?” He answered,
“One who was dearest of the folk to me and best beloved.” “Perhaps
thy father?” “No!” “Thy brother?” “No!” “One of thy
kindred?” “No!” Then asked I, “What relation was the dead
to thee?”; and he answered, “My lover.” Quoth I to myself
“This is the first proof to swear by of his lack of wit.” So I said
to him, “Assuredly there be others than she and fairer;” and he
made answer, “I never saw her, that I might judge whether or no
there be others fairer than she.” Quoth I to myself, “This is
another proof positive.” Then I said to him, “And how couldst
thou fall in love with one thou hast never seen?” He replied

<p class="c012">Once upon a time, a schoolmaster was visited by a man of letters
who entered a school and, sitting down by the host’s side, entered
into discourse with him and found him an accomplished theologian,
poet, grammarian, philologist and poet; intelligent, well
bred and pleasant spoken; whereat he wondered, saying in himself,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>“It cannot be that a man who teacheth children in a school,
should have a perfect wit.” Now when he was about to go away,
the pedant said to him, “Thou art my guest to-night;” and he
consented to receive hospitality and accompanied him to his house,
where he made much of him and set food before him. They ate
and drank and sat talking, till a third part of the night was past
when the host spread his guest a bed and went up to his Harim.
The stranger lay down and addressed himself to sleep, when, behold,
there arose a great clamour in the women’s rooms. He asked
what was the matter and they said, “A terrible thing hath befallen
the Shaykh and he is at the last gasp.” Said he, “Take me
up to him”; so they took him up to the pedagogue whom he
found lying insensible, with his blood streaming down. He
sprinkled water on his face and when he revived, he asked him
“What hath betided thee? When thou leftest me, thou wast in
all good cheer and whole of body;” and he answered, “O my
brother, after I left thee, I sat meditating on the creative works of
Almighty Allah, and said to myself:—In every thing the Lord
hath created for man, there is an use; for He (to Whom be glory!)
made the hands to seize, the feet to walk, the eyes to see, the ears
to hear and the penis to increase and multiply; and so on with all
the members of the body, except these two ballocks; there is no
use in them. So I took a razor I had by me and cut them off;
and there befel me what thou seest.” So the guest left him and
went away, saying, “He was in the right who said:—Verily no
schoolmaster who teacheth children can have a perfect wit, though
he know all the sciences.” And they tell a pleasant tale of the</p>

  <h2 id="c119" class="c007">ILLITERATE WHO SET UP FOR A SCHOOLMASTER.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, among the menials<a id="r171"></a><a href="#f171" class="c011"><sup>[171]</sup></a> of a certain mosque, a
man who knew not how to write or even to read and who gained
his bread by gulling folk. One day, it occurred to him to open a
school and teach children; so he got together writing-tablets and
written papers and hung them up in a high place. Then he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_119">119</span>greatened his turband<a id="r172"></a><a href="#f172" class="c011"><sup>[172]</sup></a> and sat down at the door of the school;
and when the people, who passed by, saw his huge head-gear and
tablets and scrolls, they thought he must be a very learned pedagogue;
so they brought him their children; and he would say to
this, “Write,” and to that “Read”; and thus the little ones
taught one another. Now one day, as he sat as of wont, at the
door of the school, behold, up came a woman letter in hand, and
he said in his mind, “This woman doubtless seeketh me, that I
may read her the missive she hath in her hand: how shall I do
with her, seeing I cannot read writing?” And he would fain have
gone down and fled from her; but, before he could do this, she
overtook him and said to him, “Whither away?” Quoth he, “I
purpose to pray the noon-prayer and return.” Quoth she, “Noon
is yet distant, so read me this letter.” He took the letter and
turning it upside down, fell to looking at it, now shaking his head
till his turband quivered, then dancing his eyebrows and anon
showing anger and concern. Now the letter came from the woman’s
husband, who was absent; and when she saw the dominie do on
this wise, she said to herself, “Doubtless my husband is dead, and
this learned doctor of law and religion is ashamed to tell me so.”
So she said to him, “O my lord, if he be dead, tell me;” but he
shook his head and held his peace. Then said she, “Shall I rend
my raiment?” “Rend!” replied he. “Shall I beat my face?”
asked she; and he answered, “Beat!” So she took the letter
from his hand and returning home fell a-weeping, she and her
children. Presently, one of her neighbours heard her sobbing and
asking what ailed her, was answered, “Of a truth she hath gotten
a letter, telling her that her husband is dead.” Quoth the man,
“This is a falsehood; for I had a letter from him but yesterday,
advising me that he is whole and in good health and will be with
her after ten days.” So he rose forthright and going in to her, said,
“Where is the letter which came to thee?” She brought it to him,
and he took it and read it; and lo! it ran as follows, “After the
usual salutations, I am well and in good health and whole and will
be with you all after ten days. Meanwhile, I send you a quilt and
an extinguisher.”<a id="r173"></a><a href="#f173" class="c011"><sup>[173]</sup></a> So she took the letter and, returning with it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>to the schoolmaster, said to him, “What induced thee to deal thus
with me?” And she repeated to him what her neighbour had
told her of her husband’s well-being and of his having sent her a
quilt and an extinguisher. Answered he, “Thou art in the right,
O good woman; for I was, at the time”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

him sit down, brought out a book and said to him, “Look therein
whilst I order my affair and return to thee.” So he looked into
the book, and behold, it treated of the Divine prohibition against
advoutry and of the punishments which Allah hath prepared for
those who commit adulterous sin. When he read this, his flesh
quaked and his hair bristled and he repented to Almighty Allah:
then he called the woman and, giving her the book, went away. Now
her husband was absent and when he returned, she told him what
had passed, whereat he was confounded and said in himself, “I fear
lest the King’s desire have fallen upon her.” And he dared not have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span>to do with her and know her carnally after this. When some time
had past, the wife told her kinsfolk of her husband’s conduct, and
they complained of him to the King, saying, “Allah advance the
King! This man hired of us a piece of land for tillage, and tilled
it awhile; then left it fallow and neither tilled it nor forsook it,
that we might let it to one who would till it. Indeed, harm is
come to the field, and we fear its corruption, for such land as that,
if it be not sown, spoileth.” Quoth the King to the man, “What
hindereth thee from sowing thy land?” Answered he, “Allah
advance the King! It reached me that the lion entered the field,
wherefor I stood in awe of him and dared not draw near it, since
knowing that I cannot cope with the lion, I stand in fear of him.”
The King understood the parable and rejoined, saying, “O man,
the lion trod and trampled not thy land, and it is good for seed;
so do thou till it and Allah prosper thee in it, for the lion hath
done it no hurt.” Then he bade give the man and his wife a
handsome present and sent them away.<a id="r175"></a><a href="#f175" class="c011"><sup>[175]</sup></a> And amongst the stories

<p class="c012">There was once a man of the people of West Africa who had
journeyed far and wide and traversed many a desert and a tide.
He was once cast upon an island, where he abode a long while and,
returning thence to his native country, brought with him the quill
of a wing-feather of a young Rukh, whilst yet in egg and unhatched;
and this quill was big enough to hold a goat-skin’s of
water, for it is said that the length of the Rukh-chick’s wing, when
he cometh forth of the egg, is a thousand fathoms. The folk marvelled
at this quill, when they saw it, and the man who was called
<span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>Abd al-Rahman the Moor (and he was known, to boot, as the
Chinaman, for his long sojourn in Cathay), related to them the

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abd al-Rahman,
the Moorman, the Chinaman, was wont to tell wondrous
tales amongst which was the following. He was on a voyage in
the China seas with a company of merchants, when they sighted
an island from afar; so they steered for it and, making fast thereto,
saw that it was large and spacious. The ship’s crew went ashore
to get wood and water, taking with them hatchets and ropes and
waterskins (the travellers accompanying them), and presently
espied a great dome, white and gleaming, an hundred cubits
long. So they made towards it and drawing near, found that
it was an egg of the Rukh and fell on it with axes and stones
and sticks till they uncovered the young bird and found the chick
as it were a firm-set hill. So they plucked out one of the wing-feathers,
but could not do so, save by helping one another, for all
the quills were not full grown; after which they took what they
could carry of the young bird’s flesh and cutting the quill away
from the vane, returned to the ship. Then they set sail and putting
out to sea, voyaged with a fair wind all that night, till the sun
rose; and while everything went well, they saw the Rukh come
flying after them, as he were a vast cloud, with a rock in his
talons, like a great heap bigger than the ship. As soon as he
poised himself in air over the vessel, he let fall the rock upon it;
but the craft, having great way on her, outwent the rock, which
fell into the sea with a loud crash and a horrible. So Allah
decreed their deliverance and saved them from doom; and they
cooked the young bird’s flesh and ate it. Now there were amongst
them old white-bearded men; and when they awoke on the morrow,
they found that their beards had turned black, nor did any
who had eaten of the young Rukh grow gray ever after. Some
said the cause of the return of youth to them and the ceasing
of hoariness from them was that they had heated the pot with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>arrow-wood, whilst others would have it that it came of eating
the Rukh-chick’s flesh; and this is indeed a wonder of wonders.<a id="r177"></a><a href="#f177" class="c011"><sup>[177]</sup></a>

  <h2 id="c124" class="c007">ADI BIN ZAYD AND THE PRINCESS HIND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">Al-Nu’uman bin al-Munzir, King of the Arabs of Irak, had
a daughter named Hind, who went out one Pasch, which is a
feast day of the Nazarenes, to the White Church, to take the
sacrament; she was eleven years old and was the loveliest woman
of her age and time; and it so chanced that on the same day
came to Hírah<a id="r178"></a><a href="#f178" class="c011"><sup>[178]</sup></a> a young man called ‘Adí bin Zayd<a id="r179"></a><a href="#f179" class="c011"><sup>[179]</sup></a> with presents
from the Chosroë to Al-Nu’uman, and he also went to
the White Church, to communicate. He was tall of stature and
fair of favour, with handsome eyes and smooth cheeks, and had
with him a company of his people. Now there was with Hind
bint al-Nu’uman a slave-girl named Máriyah, who was enamoured
of Adi, but had not been able to foregather with him. So, when
she saw him in the church, she said to Hind, “Look at yonder
youth. By Allah, he is handsomer than all thou seest!” Hind
asked, “And who is he?” and Mariyah answered, “Adi bin Zayd.”
Quoth Al-Nu’uman’s daughter, “I fear lest he know me, if I draw
nearer to look on him.” Quoth Mariyah, “How should he know
thee when he hath never seen thee?” So she drew near him
and found him jesting with the youths his companions; and
indeed he surpassed them all, not only in his personal charms
but in the excellence of his speech, the eloquence of his tongue
and the richness of his raiment. When the Princess saw him,
she was ravished with him, her reason was confounded and her
colour changed; and Mariyah, seeing her inclination to him, said
to her, “Speak to<a id="t124"></a> him.” So she spoke to him and went away. Now
when he looked upon her and heard her speech, he was captivated
by her and his wit was dazed; his heart fluttered, and his colour
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>changed, so that his companions suspected him, and he whispered
one of them to follow her and find out who she was. The young
man went after her and returning informed him that she was
Princess Hind, daughter of Al-Nu’uman. So Adi left the church,
knowing not whither he went, for excess of love, and reciting
these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">

    </div>
  </div>

<p class="c000">Then he went to his lodging and lay that night, restless and without
appetite for the food of sleep.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Adi
ended his verses he went to his lodging and lay that night restless
and without appetite for the food of sleep. Now on the morrow
Mariyah accosted him and he received her kindly, though before
he would not incline to her, and said to her, “What is thy will?”
Quoth she, “I have a want of thee;” and quoth he, “Name it, for
by Allah, thou shalt not ask me aught, but I will give it thee!”
So she told him that she loved him, and her want of him was that
he would grant her a lover’s privacy; and he agreed to do her will,
on condition that she would serve him with Hind and devise some
device to bring them together. Then he took her into a vintner’s
tavern in one of the by-streets of Hirah, and lay with her; after
which she returned to Hind and asked her, “Dost thou not long to
see Adi?” She answered, “How can this be? indeed my longing for
him makes me restless, and no repose is left me since yesterday.”
Quoth Mariyah, “I will appoint him to be in such a place, where
thou canst look on him from the palace.” Quoth Hind, “Do
what thou wilt,” and agreed with her upon the place. So Adi
came, and the Princess looked out upon him; and, when she saw
him, she was like to topple down from the palace-top and said,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>“O Mariyah, except thou bring him in to me this night, I shall
die.” So saying, she fell to the ground in a fainting-fit, and her
serving-women lifted her up and bore her into the palace; whilst
Mariyah hastened to Al-Nu’uman and discovered the whole
matter to him with perfect truth, telling him that indeed she
was mad for the love of Adi; and except he marry her to him,
she must be put to shame and die of love for him, which would
disgrace her father among the Arabs, adding at the end, “There
is no cure for this but wedlock.” The King bowed his head
awhile in thought and exclaimed again and again, “Verily, we
are Allah’s and unto Him we are returning!” Then said he,
“Woe to thee! How shall the marriage be brought about,
seeing I mislike to open the matter?” And she said, “He is
yet more ardently in love and yet more desireful of her than
she is of him; and I will so order the affair that he shall be
unaware of his case being known to thee; but do not betray
thyself, O King.” Then she went to Adi and, after acquainting
him with everything said, “Make a feast and bid the King
thereto; and, when the wine hath gotten the better of him,
ask of him his daughter, for he will not refuse thee.” Quoth
Adi, “I fear lest this enrage him against me and be the cause
of enmity between us.” But quoth she, “I came not to thee,
till I had settled the whole affair with him.” Then she returned
to Al-Nu’uman and said to him, “Seek of Adi that he
entertain thee in his house.” Replied the King, “There is no
harm in that;” and after three days, besought Adi to give him
and his lords the morning-meal in his house. He consented
and the King went to him; and when the wine had taken effect
on Al-Nu’uman, Adi rose and sought of him his daughter in
wedlock. He consented and married them and brought her to
him after three days; and they abode at Al-Nu’uman’s court,
in all solace of life and its delight——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

  <h2 id="c127" class="c007">DI’IBIL AL-KHUZA’I WITH THE LADY AND MUSLIM BIN AL-WALID.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">(Quoth Di’ibil al-Khuzá’i<a id="r181"></a><a href="#f181" class="c011"><sup>[181]</sup></a>), I was sitting one day at the gate of
Al-Karkh,<a id="r182"></a><a href="#f182" class="c011"><sup>[182]</sup></a> when a damsel came past, never saw I a fairer faced or
better formed than she, walking with a voluptuous swaying gait
and ravishing all beholders with her lithe and undulating pace.
Now as my eyes fell on her, I was captivated by her and my vitals
trembled and meseemed my heart flew forth of my breast; so I
stood before her and I accosted her with this verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The tears of these eyes find easy release; ✿ But sleep flies these eyelids without surcease.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whereon she turned her face and looking at me, straightway made
answer with this distich:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A trifle this an his eyes be sore, ✿ When her eyes say “yes” to his love-caprice!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">I was astounded at the readiness of her reply and the fluency of
her speech and rejoined with this verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Say, doth heart of my fair incline to him ✿ Whose tears like a swelling stream increase?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And she answered me without hesitation, thus:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If thou crave our love, know that love’s a loan; ✿ And a debt to be paid by us twain a-piece.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Never entered my ears aught sweeter than her speech nor ever saw
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>I brighter than her face: so I changed rhyme and rhythm to try
her, in my wonder at her words, and repeated this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Will Fate with joy of union ever bless our sight, ✿ And one desireful one with other one unite.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She smiled at this (never saw I fairer than her mouth nor sweeter
than her lips), and answered me, without stay or delay, in the
following distich:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Pray, tell me what hath Fate to do betwixt us twain? ✿ Thou’rt Fate: so bless our eyne with union and delight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">At this, I sprang up and fell to kissing her hands and cried, “I
had not thought that Fortune would vouchsafe me such occasion.
Do thou follow me, not of bidding or against thy will, but of the
grace of thee and thy favour to me.” Then I went on and she
after me. Now at that time I had no lodging I deemed fit for the
like of her; but Muslim bin al-Walíd<a id="r183"></a><a href="#f183" class="c011"><sup>[183]</sup></a> was my fast friend, and he
had a handsome house. So I made for his abode and knocked at
the door, whereupon he came out, and I saluted him, saying, “‘Tis
for time like this that friends are treasured up”; and he replied,
“With love and gladness! Come in you twain.” So we entered but
found money scarce with him: however, he gave me a kerchief,
saying, “Carry it to the bazar and sell it and buy food and what
else thou needest.” I took the handkerchief, and hastening to the
market, sold it and bought what we required of victuals and other
matters; but when I returned, I found that Muslim had retired
with her to an underground chamber.<a id="r184"></a><a href="#f184" class="c011"><sup>[184]</sup></a> When he heard my step
he hurried out and said to me, “Allah requite thee the kindness
thou hast done me, O Abu Ali and reward thee in time to come
and reckon it of thy good deeds on the Day of Doom!” So saying,
he took from me the food and wine and shut the door in my
face. His words enraged me and I knew not what to do; but he
stood behind the door, shaking for mirth; and, when he saw me
thus, he said to me, “I conjure thee on my life, O Abu Ali, tell
who it was composed this couplet?”—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I lay in her arms all night, leaving him ✿ To sleep foul-hearted but clean of staff.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>At this my rage redoubled, and I replied, “He who wrote this
other couplet”:—</p>

<p class="c000">Then I began to abuse him and reproach him with the foulness of
his action and his lack of honour; and he was silent never uttering
a word. But, when I had finished, he smiled and said, “Out
on thee, O fool! Thou hast entered my house and sold my
kerchief and spent my silver: so, with whom art thou wroth, O
pimp?”<a id="r186"></a><a href="#f186" class="c011"><sup>[186]</sup></a> Then he left me and went away to her, whilst I said,
“By Allah, thou art right to twit me as nincompoop and

my will of her nor, indeed, ever heard of her more. And amongst

day feeling weary of being on duty at the Palace and in
attendance upon the Caliph, I mounted horse and went forth, at
break of dawn, having a mind to ride out in the open country and
take my pleasure. So I said to my servants, “If there come a
messenger from the Caliph or another, say that I set out at daybreak,
upon a pressing business, and that ye know not whither I
am gone.” Then I fared forth alone and went round about the

<span class="pageno" id="Page_129">129</span>halted in a great thoroughfare known as Al-Haram, to take
shelter in the shade and found it in a spacious wing of a house
which projected over the street. And I stood there but a little
while before there came up a black slave, leading an ass bestridden
by a damsel; and under her were housings set with gems and
pearls and upon her were the richest of clothes, richness can go no
farther; and I saw that she was elegant of make with languorous
look and graceful mien. I asked one of the passers-by who she
was, and he said, “She is a singer,” so I fell in love with her at
first sight: hardly could I keep my seat on horseback. She entered
the house at whose gate I stood; and, as I was planning a device
to gain access to her, there came up two men young and comely
who asked admission and the housemaster gave them leave to
enter. So they alighted and I also and they entered and I with
them, they supposing that the master of the house had invited
me; and we sat awhile, till food was brought and we ate. Then
they set wine before us, and the damsel came out, with a lute in
her hand. She sang and we drank, till I rose to obey a call of
nature. Thereupon the host questioned the two others of me,
and they replied that they knew me not; whereupon quoth he,
“This is a parasite<a id="r187"></a><a href="#f187" class="c011"><sup>[187]</sup></a>; but he is a pleasant fellow, so treat him courteously.”
Then I came back and sat down in my place, whilst the
damsel sang to a pleasing air these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Say to angry lover who turns away, ✿ And shows thee his side whatso thou say,</div>
      <div class="line">“Thou wroughtest all that by thee was wrought, ✿ Albe ‘twas haply thy sport and play.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">I prayed her to repeat the song, that I might correct it for her;
whereupon one of the two men accosted me and said, “Never saw
we a more impudent lick-platter than thou. Art thou not content
with spunging, but thou must eke meddle and muddle? Of very
sooth, in thee is the saying made true, Parasite and pushing
wight.” So I hung down my head for shame and made him
no answer, whilst his companion would have withheld him from
me; but he would not be restrained. Presently, they rose to pray,
but I lagged behind a little and, taking the lute, screwed up the
sides and brought it into perfect tune. Then I stood up in my
place to pray with the rest; and when we had ended praying, the
same man fell again to blaming me and reviling me and persisted
in his rudeness, whilst I held my peace. Thereupon the damsel
took the lute and touching it, knew that it had been altered, and
said, “Who hath touched my lute?” Quoth they, “None of us
hath touched it.” Quoth she, “Nay, by Allah, some one hath
touched it, and he is an artist, a past master in the craft; for
he hath arranged the strings and tuned them like one who is a
perfect performer.” Said I, “It was I tuned it;” and said she,
“Then, Allah upon thee, take it and play on it!” So I took it;
and, playing a piece so difficult and so rare, that it went nigh to
deaden the quick and quicken the dead, I sang thereto these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I had a heart, and with it lived my life: ✿ ‘Twas seared with fire and burnt with loving-lowe:</div>

      <div class="line">If what I’ve tasted be the food of Love, ✿ Must taste it all men who Love-food would know.</div>

Mosul thus continued:—Now when I had finished my verse, there
was not one of the company but sprang from his place and sat
down like schoolboys before me, saying, “Allah upon thee, O
our lord, sing us another song.” “With pleasure” said I, and
playing another measure in masterly fashion, sang thereto these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When I had made an end of this song, there was not one of them
but rose to his feet and threw himself upon the ground for excess of
delight. Then I cast the lute from my hand, but they said, “Allah
upon thee, do not on this wise, but let us hear another song, so
Allah Almighty increase thee of His bounty!” Replied I, “O
folk, I will sing you another song and another and another and
will tell you who I am. I am Ishak bin Ibrahim al-Mausili, and
by Allah, I bear myself proudly to the Caliph when he seeketh
me. Ye have to-day made me hear abuse from an unmannerly
carle such as I loathe; and by Allah, I will not speak a word
nor sit with you, till ye put yonder quarrelsome churl out from
among you!” Quoth the fellow’s companion to him, “This is
what I warned thee against, fearing for thy good name.” So they
hent him by the hand and thrust him out; and I took the lute
and sang over again the songs of my own composing which the
damsel had sung. Then I whispered the host that she had taken
my heart and that I had no patience to abstain from her. Quoth
he, “She is thine on one condition.” I asked, “What is that?”
and he answered, “It is that thou abide with me a month, when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>the damsel and all belonging to her of raiment and jewellery shall
be thine.” I rejoined, “It is well, I will do this.” So I tarried
with him a whole month, whilst none knew where<a id="t133"></a> I was and the
Caliph sought me everywhere, but could come by no news of me;
and at the end of this time, the merchant delivered to me the
damsel, together with all that pertained to her of things of price
and an eunuch to attend upon her. So I brought all that to my
lodging, feeling as I were lord of the whole world, for exceeding
delight in her; then I rode forthright to Al-Maamun. And when
I stood in the presence, he said, “Woe to thee, O Ishak, where
hast thou been?” So I acquainted him with the story and he
said, “Bring me that man at once.” Thereupon I told him where
he lived and he sent and fetched him and questioned him of the
case; when he repeated the story and the Caliph said to him,
“Thou art a man of right generous mind, and it is only fitting
that thou be aided in thy generosity.” Then he ordered him an
hundred thousand dirhams and said to me, “O Ishak, bring the
damsel before me.” So I brought her to him, and she sang and
delighted him; and being greatly gladdened by her he said to
me, “I appoint her turn of service every Thursday, when she
must come and sing to me from behind the curtain.” And he
ordered her fifty thousand dirhams, so by Allah, I profited both
myself and others by my ride. And amongst the tales they tell

“Yes,” quoth we; and he said, “Know, then, that I had a daughter,

  <h2 id="c135" class="c007">HOW ABU HASAN BRAKE WIND.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">They recount that in the City Kaukabán of Al-Yaman there was
a man of the Fazlí tribe who had left Badawi life, and become
a townsman for many years and was a merchant of the most
opulent merchants. His wife had deceased when both were
young; and his friends were instant with him to marry again,
ever quoting to him the words of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Go, gossip! re-wed thee, for Prime draweth near:</div>
      <div class="line">A wife is an almanac—good for the year.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So being weary of contention, Abu Hasan entered into negotiations
with the old women who procure matches, and married a
maid like Canopus when he hangeth over the seas of Al-Hind.
He made high festival therefor, bidding to the wedding-banquet
kith and kin, Olema and Fakirs; friends and foes and all his
acquaintances of that country-side. The whole house was thrown
open to feasting: there were rices of five several colours, and
sherbets of as many more; and kids stuffed with walnuts and
almonds and pistachios and a camel-colt<a id="r192"></a><a href="#f192" class="c011"><sup>[192]</sup></a> roasted whole. So they
ate and drank and made mirth and merriment; and the bride
was displayed in her seven dresses and one more, to the women,
who could not take their eyes off her. At last, the bridegroom
was summoned to the chamber where she sat enthroned; and he
rose slowly and with dignity from his divan; but in so doing, for
that he was over full of meat and drink, lo and behold! he let fly
a fart, great and terrible. Thereupon each guest turned to his
neighbour and talked aloud and made as though he had heard
nothing, fearing for his life. But a consuming fire was lit in Abu
Hasan’s heart; so he pretended a call of nature; and, in lieu of
seeking the bride-chamber, he went down to the house-court and
saddled his mare and rode off, weeping bitterly, through the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>shadow of the night. In time he reached Láhej where he found
a ship ready to sail for India; so he shipped on board and made
Calicut of Malabar. Here he met with many Arabs, especially
Hazramís,<a id="r193"></a><a href="#f193" class="c011"><sup>[193]</sup></a> who recommended him to the King; and this King
(who was a Kafir) trusted him and advanced him to the captain-ship
of his body-guard. He remained ten years in all solace and
delight of life; at the end of which time he was seized with home-sickness;
and the longing to behold his native land was that of a
lover pining for his beloved; and he came near to die of yearning
desire. But his appointed day had not dawned; so, after taking
the first bath of health, he left the King without leave, and in due
course landed at Makallá of Hazramaut. Here he donned the rags
of a religious; and, keeping his name and case secret, fared for
Kaukaban afoot; enduring a thousand hardships of hunger, thirst
and fatigue; and braving a thousand dangers from the lion, the
snake and the Ghul. But when he drew near his old home, he
looked down upon it from the hills with brimming eyes, and said
in himself, “Haply they might know thee; so I will wander about
the outskirts, and hearken to the folk. Allah grant that my case
be not remembered by them!” He listened carefully for seven
nights and seven days, till it so chanced that, as he was sitting at
the door of a hut, he heard the voice of a young girl saying, “O
my mother, tell me the day when I was born; for such an one of
my companions is about to take an omen<a id="r194"></a><a href="#f194" class="c011"><sup>[194]</sup></a> for me.” And the
mother answered, “Thou was born, O my daughter, on the very
night when Abu Hasan farted.” Now the listener no sooner heard
these words than he rose up from the bench, and fled away saying
to himself, “Verily thy fart hath become a date, which shall last
for ever and ever; even as the poet said:”—</p>

that the maniacal vengeance of the Arab is increased by eating this flesh; the beast is
certainly vindictive enough; but a furious and frantic vengefulness characterises the
North American Indian who never saw a camel. Mercy and pardon belong to the
elect, not to the miserables who make up “humanity.”</p>

saying, If you meet a serpent and a Hazrami, slay the Hazrami. To prove how ubiquitous
they are it is related that a man, flying from their society, reached the uttermost
parts of China where he thought himself safe. But, as he was about to pass the night
in some ruin, he heard a voice hard by him exclaim, O ‘Imád al-Din! (the name of the

the custom amongst the Highlanders of Afghanistan, and its artificial nature suggests
direct derivation; for the two regions are separated by a host of tribes, Persians and
Baloch, Sindis and Panjábis who utterly ignore the point of honour and behave like
Europeans. The raids of the pre-Islamitic Arabs over the lands lying to the north-east

Tamím spake as follows. I went out one day in search of an
estray and, coming to the waters of the Banu Tayy, saw two
companies of people near one another, and behold, those of one
company were disputing among themselves even as the other.
So I watched them and observed, in one of the companies, a
youth wasted with sickness, as he were a worn-out dried-up water-skin.
And as I looked on him, lo! he repeated these couplets:—</p>

hastened towards him, and when her people followed her, she
fought them off. Then the youth caught sight of her and sprang
up and ran towards her, whilst the people of his party ran after
him and laid hold of him. However he haled and freed himself
from them, and she in like manner loosed herself; and, when
they were free, each ran to other and meeting between the two
parties, embraced and fell dead upon the ground.——And Shahrazad

Then weeping sore he said, “Allah have ruth on you
both! by the Almighty, though you were not united in your lives,
I will at least unite you after your deaths.” And he bade lay
them out: so they washed them and shrouded them in one
shroud and dug for them one grave and prayed one prayer over
them both and buried them in one tomb; nor was there man
or woman in the two parties but I saw weeping over them and
buffeting their faces. Then I questioned the Shaykh of them,
and he said, “She was my daughter and he my brother’s son;
and love brought them to the pass thou seest.” I exclaimed,
“Allah amend thee! but why didst thou not marry them to each

the cells, with bare head and eyes intently fixed upon the wall.
We saluted him, and he returned our salam, without looking at

  <h2 id="c141" class="c007">THE PRIOR WHO BECAME A MOSLEM.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">Quoth Abu Bakr Mohammed ibn Al-Anbári<a id="r204"></a><a href="#f204" class="c011"><sup>[204]</sup></a>:—I once left Anbár
on a journey to ‘Amúríyah,<a id="r205"></a><a href="#f205" class="c011"><sup>[205]</sup></a> where there came out to me the
prior of the monastery and superior of the monkery, Abd al-Masíh
hight, and brought me into the building. There I found forty
religious, who entertained me that night with fair guest-rite, and I
left them after seeing among them such diligence in adoration
and devotion as I never beheld the like of in any others. Next
day I farewelled them and fared forth and, after doing my business
at ‘Amuriyah, I returned to my home at Anbar. And next year
I made pilgrimage to Meccah and as I was circumambulating the
Holy House I saw Abd al-Masih the monk also compassing the
Ka’abah, and with him five of his fellows, the shavelings. Now
when I was sure that it was indeed he, I accosted him, saying,
“Art thou not Abd al-Masih, the Religious?” and he replied, “Nay,
I am Abdallah, the Desirous.”<a id="r206"></a><a href="#f206" class="c011"><sup>[206]</sup></a> Therewith I fell to kissing his grey
hairs and shedding tears; then, taking him by the hand, I led him
aside into a corner of the Temple and said to him, “Tell me the
cause of thy conversion to Al-Islam;” and he made reply,
“Verily, ‘twas a wonder of wonders, and befel thus. A company
of Moslem devotees came to the village wherein is our convent,
and sent a youth to buy them food. He saw, in the market, a
Christian damsel selling bread, who was of the fairest of women;
and he was struck at first sight with such love of her, that his
senses failed him and he fell on his face in a fainting-fit.” When
he revived, he returned to his companions and told them what had
befallen him, saying, “Go ye about your business; I may not go
with you.” They chided him and exhorted him, but he paid no
heed to them; so they left him whilst he entered the village and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>seated himself at the door of the woman’s booth.<a id="r207"></a><a href="#f207" class="c011"><sup>[207]</sup></a> She asked
him what he wanted, and he told her that he was in love with her,
whereupon she turned from him; but he abode in his place three
days without tasting food, keeping his eyes fixed on her face.
Now whenas she saw that he departed not from her, she went to
her people and acquainted them with his case, and they set on
him the village boys, who stoned him and bruised his ribs and
broke his head; but, for all this, he would not budge. Then the
villagers took counsel together to slay him; but a man of them
came to me and told me of his case, and I went out to him and
found him lying prostrate on the ground. So I wiped the blood
from his face and carried him to the convent, and dressed his
wounds; and there he abode with me fourteen days. But as soon
as he could walk, he left the monastery——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abdallah
the Religious continued:—So I carried him to the convent and
dressed his wounds, and he abode with me fourteen days. But as
soon as he could walk, he left the monastery and returned to the
door of the woman’s booth, where he sat gazing on her as before.
When she saw him, she came out to him and said, “By Allah,
thou movest me to pity! wilt thou enter my faith that I may
marry thee?” He cried, “Allah forbid that I should put off the
faith of Unity and enter that of Plurality!”<a id="r208"></a><a href="#f208" class="c011"><sup>[208]</sup></a> Quoth she, “Come
in with me to my house and take thy will of me and wend thy
ways in peace.” Quoth he, “Not so, I will not waste the worship
of twelve years for the lust of an eye-twinkle.” Said she, “Then
depart from me forthwith;” and he said, “My heart will not suffer
me to do that;” whereupon she turned her countenance from him.
Presently the boys found him out and began to pelt him with
stones; and he fell on his face, saying, “Verily, Allah is my protector,
who sent down the Book of the Koran; and He protecteth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>the Righteous!”<a id="r209"></a><a href="#f209" class="c011"><sup>[209]</sup></a> At this I sallied forth and driving away the

mine, unite me with her in Paradise!” Then I carried him to
the monastery; but he died, before I could reach it, and I bore
him without the village and I dug for him a grave and buried
him. And next night when half of it was spent, the damsel cried
with a great cry (and she in her bed); so the villagers flocked to
her and questioned her of her case. Quoth she, “As I slept,
behold the Moslem man came in to me and taking me by the
hand, carried me to the gate of Paradise; but the Guardian
denied me entrance, saying:—’Tis forbidden to unbelievers. So
I embraced Al-Islam at his hands and, entering with him, beheld
therein pavilions and trees, such as I cannot describe to you.
Moreover, he brought me to a pavilion of jewels and said to me,
Of a truth this is my pavilion and thine, nor will I enter it save
with thee; but, after five nights thou shalt be with me therein, if
it be the will of Allah Almighty. Then he put forth his hand to
a tree which grew at the door of the pavilion and plucked therefrom
two apples and gave them to me, saying:—Eat this and keep
the other, that the monks may see it. So I ate one of them and
never tasted I aught sweeter.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the woman
continued:—So he plucked two apples and gave them to me,
saying, “Eat this and keep the other that the monks may see it.”
So I ate one of them and never tasted I aught sweeter. Then he
took my hand and fared forth and carried me back to my house;
and, when I awoke, I found the taste of the apple in my mouth
and the other in my hand.” So saying she brought out the apple,
and in the darkness of the night it shone as it were a sparkling
star. So they carried her (and the apple with her) to the monastery,
where she repeated her vision and showed it to us; never saw
we its like among all the fruits of the world. Then I took a knife
and cut the apple into pieces according as we were folk in company;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_143">143</span>and never knew we aught more delicious than its savour
nor more delightsome than its scent; but we said, “Haply this
was a devil that appeared unto her to seduce her from her faith.”
Thereupon her people took her and went away; but she abstained
from eating and drinking and on the fifth night she rose from her
bed, and going forth the village to the grave of her Moslem lover
threw herself upon it and died, her family not knowing what was
come of her. But, on the morrow, there came to the village two
Moslem elders, clad in hair-cloth, and with them two women in
like garb, and said, “O people of the village, with you is a woman
Saint, a Wáliyah of the friends of Allah, who died a Moslemah;
and we will take charge of her in lieu of you.” So the villagers
sought her and found her dead on the Moslem’s grave; and they
said, “This was one of us and she died in our faith; so we will
take charge of her.” Rejoined the two old men, “Nay, she died
a Moslemah and we claim her.” And the dispute waxed to a
quarrel between them, till one of the Shaykhs said, “Be this the
test of her faith: the forty monks of the monastery shall come
and try to lift her from the grave. If they succeed, then she died
a Nazarene; if not, one of us shall come and lift her up and if she
be lifted by him, she died a Moslemah.” The villagers agreed to
this and fetched the forty monks, who heartened one another, and
came to her to lift her, but could not. Then we tied a great rope
round her middle and haled at it; but the rope broke in sunder,
and she stirred not; and the villagers came and did the like, but
could not move her from her place.<a id="r210"></a><a href="#f210" class="c011"><sup>[210]</sup></a> At last, when all means
failed, we said to one of the two Shaykhs, “Come thou and lift
her.” So he went up to the grave and, covering her with his
mantle, said, “In the name of Allah the Compassionating, the
Compassionate, and of the Faith of the Apostle of Allah, on whom
be prayers and peace!” Then he lifted her and, taking her in his
bosom, betook himself with her to a cave hard by, where they laid
her, and the two women came and washed her and shrouded her.
Then the two elders bore her to her Moslem lover’s grave and
prayed over her and buried her by his side and went their ways.
Now we were eye-witnesses of all this; and, when we were alone
<span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>with one another, we said, “‘In sooth, the truth is most worthy to
be followed;’<a id="r211"></a><a href="#f211" class="c011"><sup>[211]</sup></a> and indeed the verity hath been made manifest to us,
nor is there a proof more patent of the truth of Al-Islam than
that we have seen this day with our eyes.” So I and all the
monks became Moslems and on like wise did the villagers; and
we sent to the people of Mesopotamia for a doctor of the law, to
instruct us in the ordinances of Al-Islam and the canons of the
Faith. They sent us a learned man and a pious, who taught us
the rites of prayer and the tenets of the faith; and we are now in
ease abounding; so to Allah be the praise and the thanks! And
they also tell a tale of</p>

<p class="c012">Quoth Amrú bin Masa’dah:<a id="r212"></a><a href="#f212" class="c011"><sup>[212]</sup></a>—Abú Isá, son of Al-Rashíd and
brother to Al-Maamun, was enamoured of one Kurrat al-Ayn, a
slave-girl belonging to Ali bin Hishám,<a id="r213"></a><a href="#f213" class="c011"><sup>[213]</sup></a> and she also loved him;
but he concealed his passion, complaining of it to none neither
discovering his secret to anyone, of his pride and magnanimity;
for he had used his utmost endeavour to purchase her of her
master, but he had failed. At last when his patience was at an
end and his passion was sore on him and he was helpless in the
matter, he went in to Al-Maamun, one day of state after the folk
had retired, and said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful, if
thou wilt this day make trial of thine Alcaydes by taking them
unawares, thou wilt know the generous from the mean and note
each one’s place, after the quality of his mind.” But, in saying
this he purposed only to sit with Kurrat al-Ayn in her lord’s house.
Quoth Al-Maamun, “Right is thy recking,” and bade make ready
a barge, called ‘the Flyer,’ wherein he embarked with Abu Isa
and a party of his chief officers. The first mansion he visited
unexpectedly was that of Hamíd al-Tawíl of Tús, whom he found
seated——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Al-Maamun
embarked with his chief officers and fared on till they reached the
mansion of Hamíd al-Tawíl of Tús; and, unexpectedly entering,
they found him seated on a mat and before him singers and players,
with lutes and flageolets and other instruments of music in their
hands. So Al-Maamun sat with him awhile and presently he set
before him dishes of nothing but fleshmeat, with no birds among
them. The Caliph would not taste thereof and Abu Isa said to
him, “O Commander of the Faithful, we have taken the owner of
this place unawares, and he knew not of thy coming; but now let
us go to another place which is prepared for thee and fitted for
thee.” Thereupon the Caliph arose and betook himself with his
brother Abu Isa and his suite, to the abode of Ali son of Hishám
who, on hearing of their approach, came out and received them
with the goodliest of reception, and kissed the earth before the
King. Then he brought them into his mansion and opened to
them a saloon than which seer never saw a goodlier. Its floors,
pillars and walls were of many-coloured marbles, adorned with
Greek paintings: and it was spread with matting of Sind<a id="r214"></a><a href="#f214" class="c011"><sup>[214]</sup></a> whereon
were carpets and tapestry of Bassorah make, fitted to the length
and breadth of the room. So the Caliph sat awhile, examining
the house and its ceilings and walls, then said, “Give us somewhat
to eat.” So they brought him forthwith nearly an hundred
dishes of poultry besides other birds and brewises, fritters and
cooling marinades. When he had eaten, he said, “Give us something
to drink, O Ali;” and the host set before him, in vessels
of gold and silver and crystal, raisin-wine boiled down to one
third with fruits and spices; and the cupbearers were pages like
moons, clad in garments of Alexandrian stuff interwoven with
gold and bearing on their breasts beakers of crystal, full of
rose-water mingled with musk. So Al-Maamun marvelled with
exceeding marvel at all he saw and said, “Ho thou, Abu al-Hasan!”
Whereupon Ali sprang to the Caliph’s carpet and
kissing it, said, “At thy service, O Commander of the Faithful!”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>and stood before him. Quoth Al-Maamun, “Let us hear some
pleasant and merry song.” Replied Ali, “I hear and obey, O
Commander of the Faithful,” and said to one of his eunuchs,
“Fetch the singing-women.” So the slave went out and presently
returned, followed by ten castratos, bearing ten stools of gold,
which they set down in due order; and after these came ten
damsels, concubines of the master, as they were shining full
moons or gardens full of bloom, clad in black brocade, with
crowns of gold on their heads; and they passed along the room
till they sat down on the stools, when sang they sundry songs.
Al-Maamun looked at one of them; and, being captivated by
her elegance and fair favour, asked her, “What is thy name, O
damsel?”; and she answered, “My name is Sajáhí,<a id="r215"></a><a href="#f215" class="c011"><sup>[215]</sup></a> O Commander

and Abu Isa and Ali drank and the damsels went away and
were succeeded by other ten, all clad in flowered silk of Al-Yaman,
brocaded with gold, who sat down on the chairs and
sang various songs. The Caliph looked at one of the concubines,
who was like a wild heifer of the waste, and said to her,
“What is thy name, O damsel?” She replied, “My name is
Zabiyah,<a id="r218"></a><a href="#f218" class="c011"><sup>[218]</sup></a> O Commander of the Faithful;” and he, “Sing to us,

drank, whilst the girls went away and there came forth yet
other ten, as they were rubies, robed in red brocade inwoven
with gold and purfled with pearls and jewels whilst all their
heads were bare. They sat down on the stools and sang various

sun of the day, and asked her, “What is thy name, O damsel?”;
and she answered, “O Commander of the Faithful, my name is

<p class="c000">“Well sung, O Fatin!” exclaimed the Caliph; “whose verse is
this?” And she answered, “Adi bin Zayd’s, and the air is
antique.” Then all three drank, whilst the damsels retired and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>were succeeded by other ten maidens, as they were sparkling
stars, clad in flowered silk embroidered with red gold and girt
with jewelled zones. They sat down and sang various motives;
and the Caliph asked one of them, who was like a wand of
willow, “What is thy name, O damsel?”; and she answered,
“My name is Rashaa<a id="r221"></a><a href="#f221" class="c011"><sup>[221]</sup></a>, O Commander of the Faithful.” “Sing
to us, O Rashaa,” quoth he; so she played a lively measure
and sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And wand-like Houri, who can passion heal ✿ Like young gazelle that paceth o’er the plain:</div>

      <div class="line">Then sleeps the night with me, the while I cry ✿ “This is the only gain my Soul would gain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Said the Caliph, “Well done, O damsel! Sing us something
more.” So she rose and kissing the ground before him, sang
the following distich:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

<p class="c000">The Caliph was highly pleased with this couplet and, when the
slave-girl saw how much it delighted him, she repeated it several
times. Then said Al-Maamun, “Bring up ‘the Flyer,’” being
minded to embark and depart: but Ali bin Hisham said to him,
“O Commander of the Faithful, I have a slave-girl, whom I
bought for ten thousand dinars; she hath taken my heart in
whole and part, and I would fain display her to the Commander
of the Faithful. If she please him and he will accept of her, she
is his: and if not, let him hear something from her.” Said the
Caliph, “Bring her to me;” and forth came a damsel, as she were
a branchlet of willow, with seducing eyes and eyebrows set like
twin bows; and on her head she wore a crown of red gold crusted
with pearls and jewelled, under which was a fillet bearing this
couplet wrought in letters of chrysolite:—</p>

Al-Maamun marvelled at her beauty and loveliness; but, when
Abu Isa saw her, his heart throbbed with pain, his colour changed
to pale and wan and he was in evil case. Asked the Caliph, “O
Abu Isa, what aileth thee to change thus?;” and he answered, “O
Commander of the Faithful, it is because of a twitch that seizeth
me bytimes.” Quoth the Caliph, “Hast thou known yonder
damsel before to-day?” Quoth he, “Yes, O Commander of the
Faithful, can the moon be concealed?” Then said Al-Maamun
to her, “What is thy name, O damsel?”; and she replied, “My
name is Kurrat al-Ayn, O Commander of the Faithful,” and he
rejoined, “Sing to us, O Kurrat al-Ayn.” So she sang these two
couplets:—</p>

Whose song is that?”; whereto she answered “The
words are by Di’ibil al-Khuza’i, and the air by Zurzúr al-Saghír.”
Abu Isa looked at her and his tears choked him; so that the
company marvelled at him. Then she turned to Al-Maamun and
said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful, wilt thou give me
leave to change the words?” Said he, “Sing what thou wilt;” so
she played a merry measure and carolled these couplets:—</p>

<p class="c000">But when she had finished, Abu Isa said, “O Commander of the

<p class="c000">When Abu Isa heard this he fell to weeping and wailing and
evidencing his trouble and anguish. Then he raised his eyes to

<p class="c000">When he had ended, Ali bin Hisham sprang up and kissing his
feet, said, “O my lord, Allah hearing thy secret hath answered
thy prayer and consenteth to thy taking her with all she hath of
things rare and fair, so the Commander of the Faithful have no
mind to her.” Quoth Al-Maamun, “Had we a mind to her, we
would prefer Abu Isa before ourselves and help him to his desire.”
So saying, he rose and embarking, went away, whilst Abu Isa
tarried for Kurrat al-Ayn, whom he took and carried to his own

uncle Ibrahim bin Al-Mahdi, where he saw a slave-girl playing
upon the lute; and, she being one of the fairest of women, his
heart inclined to her. Ibrahim, seeing how it was with him, sent
the girl to him, with rich raiment and precious ornaments. When
he saw her, he thought that his uncle had lain with her; so he
was loath to have to do with her, because of that, and accepting
what came with her sent her back to Ibrahim. His uncle learnt
the cause of this from one of Al-Amin’s eunuchs; so he took a
shift of watered silk and worked upon its skirt, in letters of gold,
these two couplets:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he clad her in the shift and, giving her a lute, sent her back
again to his nephew. When she came into Al-Amin’s presence,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>she kissed ground before him and tuning the lute, sang thereto

  <h2 id="c154" class="c007">THE MAN’S DISPUTE WITH THE LEARNED WOMAN CONCERNING THE RELATIVE EXCELLENCE OF MALE AND FEMALE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">Quoth a certain man of learning, I never saw amongst woman-kind
one wittier, and wiser, better read and by nature more
generously bred; and in manners and morals more perfected
than a preacher of the people of Baghdad, by name Sitt al-Mashá’ikh.<a id="r229"></a><a href="#f229" class="c011"><sup>[229]</sup></a>
It chanced that she came to Hamah-city in the
year of the Flight five hundred and sixty and one<a id="r230"></a><a href="#f230" class="c011"><sup>[230]</sup></a>; and there
delivered salutary exhortations to the folk from the professorial
chair. Now there used to visit her house a number of students of
divinity and persons of learning and polite letters, who would discuss
with her questions of theology and dispute with her on controversial
points. I went to her one day, with a friend of mine, a
man of years and education; and when we had taken our seats,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>she set before us a dish of fruit and seated herself behind a curtain.
Now she had a brother, a handsome youth, who stood
behind us, to serve us. And when we had eaten we fell to disputing
upon points of divinity, and I propounded to her a theological
question bearing upon a difference between the Imams,
the Founders of the Four Schools. She proceeded to speak in
answer, whilst I listened; but all the while my friend fell to
looking upon her brother’s face and admiring his beauties without
paying any heed to what she discoursed. Now as she was
watching him from behind the curtain; when she had made an
end of her speech, she turned to him and said, “Methinks thou
be of those who give men the preference over women!” He
replied, “Assuredly,” and she asked, “And why so?”; whereto
he answered, “For that Allah hath made the masculine worthier
than the feminine;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh
replied, “For that Allah hath made the masculine worthier than
the feminine; and I like the excelling and mislike the excelled.”
She laughed and presently said, “Wilt thou deal fairly with me
in debate, if I battle the matter with thee?” and he rejoined,
“Yes.” Then quoth she, “What is the evidence of the superiority
of the male to the female?” Quoth he, “It is of two kinds, traditional
and reasonable. The authoritative part deriveth from the
Koran and the Traditions of the Apostle. As for the first we
have the very words of Almighty Allah, ‘Men shall have the pre-eminence
above women because of those advantages wherein Allah
hath caused the one of them to excel the other;’<a id="r231"></a><a href="#f231" class="c011"><sup>[231]</sup></a> and again, ‘If
there be not two men, let there be one man and two women;’<a id="r232"></a><a href="#f232" class="c011"><sup>[232]</sup></a>
and again, when treating of inheritance, ‘If there be brothers and
sisters let a male have as much as the portion of two females.’<a id="r233"></a><a href="#f233" class="c011"><sup>[233]</sup></a>
Thus Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) hath in these places
preferred the male over the female and teacheth that a woman is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>as the half of a man, for that he is worthier than she As for
the Sunnah-traditions, is it not reported of the Prophet (whom
Allah save and assain!) that he appointed the blood-money for
a woman to be half that of a man? And as for the evidence
of reason, the male is the agent and active and the female the
patient and passive.”<a id="r234"></a><a href="#f234" class="c011"><sup>[234]</sup></a> Rejoined she, “Thou hast said well, O my
lord, but, by Allah, thou hast proved my contention with thine
own lips and hast advanced evidence which telleth against thee,
and not for thee. And thus it is: Allah (extolled and exalted
be He!) preferred the male above the female solely because of
the inherent condition and essential quality of masculinity; and
in this there is no dispute between us. Now this quality of male-hood
is common to the child, the boy, the youth, the adult and
the old man; nor is there any distinction between them in this.
If, then, the superior excellence of male masculant belong to him
solely by virtue of manhood, it behoveth that thy heart incline
and thy soul delight in the greybeard, equally with the boy;
seeing that there is no distinction between them, in point of male-hood.
But the difference between thee and me turneth upon the
accident of qualities that are sought as constituting the pleasure
of intercourse and its enjoyment; and thou hast adduced no proof
of the superiority of the youth over the young girl in this matter
of non-essentials.” He made answer, “O reverend lady, knowest
thou not that which is peculiar to the youth of limber shape and
rosy cheeks and pleasant smile and sweetness of speech? Youths
are, in these respects superior to women; and the proof of this is
what they traditionally report of the Prophet (whom Allah bless
and preserve!) that he said, ‘Stay not thy gaze upon the beardless,
for in them is a momentary eye-glance at the black-eyed girls of
Paradise.’ Nor indeed is the superiority of the lad over the lass
hidden to any of mankind, and how well saith Abu Nowas:<a id="r235"></a><a href="#f235" class="c011"><sup>[235]</sup></a>—</p>

kid and wild cow? The girl is soft of speech, fair of form, like
a branchlet of basil, with teeth like chamomile-petals and hair
like halters wherefrom to hang hearts. Her cheeks are like blood-red
anemones and her face like a pippin: she hath lips like wine

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the preacher-woman
thus pursued her theme in the praise of fair maids, “She
hath two lips of cramoisy, than cream smoother and than honey
sweeter;” adding, “And she hath a bosom, as it were a way two
hills between which are a pair of breasts like globes of ivory
sheen; likewise, a stomach right smooth, flanks soft as the palm-spathe
and creased with folds and dimples which overlap one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>another, and liberal thighs, which like columns of pearl arise, and
back parts which billow and beat together like seas of glass or
mountains of glance, and two feet and hands of gracious mould
like unto ingots of virgin gold. So, O miserable! where are
mortal men beside the Jinn? Knowest thou not that puissant
princes and potent Kings before women ever humbly bend and on
them for delight depend? Verily, they may say;—We rule over
necks and rob hearts. These women! how many a rich man have
they not paupered, how many a powerful man have they not prostrated
and how many a superior man have they not enslaved! Indeed,
they seduce the sage and send the saint to shame and bring the
wealthy to want and plunge the fortune-favoured into penury. Yet
for all this, the wise but redouble in affection of them and honour;
nor do they count this oppression or dishonour. How many a
man for them hath offended his Maker and called down on himself
the wrath of his father and mother! And all this because of
the conquest of their love over hearts. Knowest thou not, O
wretched one, that for them are built pavilions, and slave-girls are
for sale;<a id="r242"></a><a href="#f242" class="c011"><sup>[242]</sup></a> that for them tear-floods rail and for them are collected
jewels of price and ambergris and musk odoriferous; and armies are
arrayed and pleasaunces made and wealth heaped up and smitten off
is many a head?” And indeed he spoke sooth in the words, ‘Whoso
saith the world meaneth woman.’ Now as for thy citation from the
Holy Traditions, it is an argument against thee and not for thee;
in that the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!) compareth
the beardless with the black-eyed girls of Paradise. Now, doubtless,
the subject of comparison is worthier than the object therewith
compared; so, unless women be the worthier and the goodlier,
wherefore should other than they be likened to them? As for thy
saying that girls are likened to boys, the case is not so, but the
contrary: boys are likened to girls; for folk say, Yonder boy is
like a girl. As for what proof thou quotest from the poets, the
verses were the product of a complexion unnatural in this respect;
and as for the habitual sodomites and catamites, offenders against
religion, Almighty Allah hath condemned them in His Holy Book,<a id="r243"></a><a href="#f243" class="c011"><sup>[243]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>wherein He denounceth their filthy practices, saying, Do ye approach

which your Lord hath created for you? Surely ye are a people
who transgress! These it is that liken girls to boys, of their

the fiend and own lusts, so that they say, She is apt for two tricks;<a id="r245"></a><a href="#f245" class="c011"><sup>[245]</sup></a>

<p class="c000">As for what thou sayest of a youth’s first hair on cheek and lips
and how they add to his beauty and loveliness, by Allah, thou
strayest from the straight path of sooth and sayest that which is

their godly works. And had the Almighty known that the joy
supreme was in the possession of other than women, He had
rewarded them therewith and promised it to them. And quoth
he (whom Allah bless and preserve!), The things I hold dearest
of the things of your world are three: women and perfume and
the solace of my eyes in prayer. Verily Allah hath appointed
boys to serve his prophets and saints in Paradise, because Paradise
is the abode of joy and delight, which could not be complete
without the service of youths; but, as to the use of them for aught
but service, it is Hell’s putridity<a id="r248"></a><a href="#f248" class="c011"><sup>[248]</sup></a> and corruption and turpitude.

</div>

<p class="c012">(Quoth Abu al-Ayná.) There were in our street two women, one
of whom had for lover a man and the other a beardless youth, and
they foregathered one night on the terrace-roof of a house adjoining
mine, knowing not that I was near. Quoth the boy’s lover to
the other, “O my sister, how canst thou bear with patience the
harshness of thy lover’s beard as it falleth on thy breast, when
he busseth thee and his mustachios rub thy cheek and lips?”
Replied the other, “Silly that thou art, what decketh the tree
save its leaves and the cucumber but its warts?<a id="r256"></a><a href="#f256" class="c011"><sup>[256]</sup></a> Didst ever
see in the world aught uglier than a scald-head bald of his beard?

women; and what is the difference between chin and cheek?<a id="r257"></a><a href="#f257" class="c011"><sup>[257]</sup></a>
Knowest thou not that Allah (extolled and exalted be He!)
hath created an angel in Heaven, who saith:—Glory be to Him
who ornamenteth men with beards and women with long hair?
So, were not the beard even as the tresses in comeliness, it had
not been coupled with them, O silly! How shall I spread-eagle
myself under a boy, who will emit long before I can go off and
forestall me in limpness of penis and clitoris; and leave a man
who, when he taketh breath clippeth close and when he entereth
goeth leisurely, and when he hath done, repeateth, and when he
pusheth poketh hard, and as often as he withdraweth, returneth?”

my lover by the lord of the Ka’abah!” And amongst tales

</div>

<p class="c012">There lived once, in the city of Cairo, a merchant who had
great store of monies and bullion, gems and jewels, and lands
and houses beyond count, and his name was Hasan the Jeweller,
the Baghdad man. Furthermore Allah had blessed him with
a son of perfect beauty and brilliancy; rosy-cheeked, fair of face
and well-figured, whom he named Ali of Cairo and had taught
the Koran and science and elocution and the other branches of
polite education, till he became proficient in all manner of knowledge.
He was under his father’s hand in trade but, after a while,
Hasan fell sick and his sickness grew upon him, till he made sure
of death; so he called his son to him,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Jeweller, the Baghdadi, fell sick and made sure of death, he called
to him his son, named Ali of Cairo, and said, “O my son, verily
this world passeth away; but the next world endureth for aye.
Every soul shall taste of death;<a id="r258"></a><a href="#f258" class="c011"><sup>[258]</sup></a> and now, O my son, my decease
is at hand and I desire to charge thee with a charge, which if
thou observe, thou shalt abide in safety and prosperity, till thou
meet Almighty Allah; but if thou follow it not, there shall befal
thee much weariness and thou wilt repent of having transgressed
mine injunctions.” Replied Ali, “O my father, how shall I do
other than hearken to thy words and act according to thy charge,
seeing that I am bounden by the law of the Faith to obey thee
and give ear to thy command?” Rejoined his father, “O my son,
I leave thee lands and houses and goods and wealth past count;
so that wert thou each day to spend thereof five hundred dinars,
thou wouldst miss naught of it. But, O my son, look that thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>live in the fear of Allah and follow His Chosen One, Mustafa,
(whom may He bless and preserve!) in whatso he is reported to
have bidden and forbidden in his traditional law.<a id="r259"></a><a href="#f259" class="c011"><sup>[259]</sup></a> Be thou constant
in alms-deeds and the practice of beneficence and in consorting
with men of worth and piety and learning; and look that
thou have a care for the poor and needy and shun avarice and
meanness and the conversation of the wicked or those of suspicious
character. Look thou kindly upon thy servants and
family, and also upon thy wife, for she is of the daughters of
the great and is big with child by thee; haply Allah will
vouchsafe thee virtuous issue by her.” And he ceased not to
exhort him thus, weeping and saying, “O my son, I beseech
Allah the Bountiful, the Lord of the glorious Empyrean<a id="r260"></a><a href="#f260" class="c011"><sup>[260]</sup></a> to
deliver thee from all straits that may encompass thee and grant
thee His ready relief!” Thereupon his son wept with sore
weeping and said, “O my father, I am melted by thy words,
for these are as the words of one that saith farewell.” Replied
the merchant, “Yes, O my son, I am aware of my condition:
forget thou not my charge.” Then he fell to repeating the two
professions of the Faith and to reciting verses of the Koran,
until the appointed hour arrived, when he said, “Draw near unto
me, O my son.” So Ali drew near and he kissed him; then he
sighed and his soul departed his body and he went to the mercy
of Almighty Allah.<a id="r261"></a><a href="#f261" class="c011"><sup>[261]</sup></a> Therewith great grief fell upon Ali; the
clamour of keening arose in his house and his father’s friends
flocked to him. Then he betook himself to preparing the body
for burial and made him a splendid funeral. They bore his
bier to the place of prayer and prayed over him, then to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>cemetery, where they buried him and recited over him what
suited of the sublime Koran; after which they returned to the
house and condoled with the dead man’s son and wended each
his own way. Moreover, Ali prayed the Friday prayer for his
father and had perlections of the Koran every day for the normal
forty, during which time he abode in the house and went not
forth, save to the place of prayer; and every Friday he visited
his father’s tomb. So he ceased not from his praying and reciting
for some time, until his fellows of the sons of the merchants came
in to him one day and saluting him, said, “How long this thy
mourning and neglecting thy business and the company of thy
friends? Verily, this is a fashion which will bring thee weariness,
and thy body will suffer for it exceedingly.” Now when they
came in to him, Iblis the Accursed was with them, prompting
them; and they went on to recommend him to accompany them
to the bazar, whilst Iblis tempted him to consent to them, till
he yielded,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
sons of the merchants went in to Ali the Cairene, son of Hasan
the Jeweller, they recommended him to accompany them to the
bazar, till he yielded, that the will of Allah (extolled and exalted
be He!) might be fulfilled; and he left the house of mourning with
them. Presently they said, “Mount thy she-mule and ride with
us to such a garden, that we may solace us there and that thy
grief and despondency may depart from thee.” So he mounted
and taking his slave, went with them to the garden in question;
and when they entered one of them went and making ready the
morning-meal, brought it to them there. So they ate and were
merry and sat in talk, till the end of the day, when they mounted
and returned each to his own lodging, where they passed the
night. As soon as the morrow dawned, they again visited Ali
and said, “Come with us.” Asked he, “Whither?”; and they
answered, “To such a garden; for it is finer than the first and
more pleasurable.” So he went with them to the garden, and
one of them, going away, made ready the morning-meal and
brought it to them, together with strong heady wine; and after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>eating they brought out the wine, when quoth Ali, “What is
this?” and quoth they, “This is what dispelleth sadness and
brighteneth gladness.” And they ceased not to commend it to
him, till they prevailed upon him and he drank with them.
Then they sat, drinking and talking, till the end of the day,
when each returned home. But as for Ali, the Cairene, he was
giddy with wine and in this plight went in to his wife, who said
to him, “What aileth thee that thou art so changed?” He said,
“We were making merry to-day, when one of my companions
brought us liquor; so my friends drank and I with them, and
this giddiness came upon me.” And she replied, “O my lord,
say me, hast thou forgotten thy father’s injunction and done
that from which he forbade thee, in consorting with doubtful
folk?” Answered he, “These be of the sons of the merchants;
they are no suspicious folk, only lovers of mirth and good
cheer.” And he continued to lead this life with his friends, day
after day, going from place to place and feasting with them
and drinking, till they said to him, “Our turns are ended, and
now it is thy turn.” “Well come, and welcome and fair cheer!”
cried he; so on the morrow, he made ready all that the case
called for of meat and drink, two-fold what they had provided,
and taking cooks and tent-pitchers and coffee-makers,<a id="r262"></a><a href="#f262" class="c011"><sup>[262]</sup></a> repaired
with the others to Al-Rauzah<a id="r263"></a><a href="#f263" class="c011"><sup>[263]</sup></a> and the Nilometer, where they
abode a whole month, eating and drinking and hearing music
and making merry. At the end of the month, Ali found that
he had spent a great sum of money; but Iblis the Accursed
deluded him and said to him, “Though thou shouldst spend
every day a like sum yet wouldst thou not miss aught of it.” So
he took no account of money expenses and continued this way of
life for three years, whilst his wife remonstrated with him and
reminded him of his father’s charge; but he hearkened not to her
words, till he had spent all the ready monies he had, when he
fell to selling his jewels and spending their price, until they also
were all gone. Then he sold his houses, fields, farms and gardens,
one after other, till they likewise were all gone and he had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>nothing left but the tenement wherein he lived. So he tore
out the marble and wood-work and sold it and spent of its
price, till he had made an end of all this also, when he took
thought with himself and, finding that he had nothing left to
expend, sold the house itself and spent the purchase-money. After
that, the man who had bought the house came to him and said
“Seek out for thyself a lodging, as I have need of my house.”
So he bethought himself and, finding that he had no want of a
house, except for his wife, who had borne him a son and daughter
(he had not a servant left), he hired a large room in one of the
mean courts<a id="r264"></a><a href="#f264" class="c011"><sup>[264]</sup></a> and there took up his abode, after having lived in
honour and luxury, with many eunuchs and much wealth; and he
soon came to want one day’s bread. Quoth his wife, “Of this I
warned thee and exhorted thee to obey thy father’s charge, and
thou wouldst not hearken to me; but there is no Majesty and
there is no Might, save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Whence
shall the little ones eat? Arise then, go round to thy friends, the
sons of the merchants: belike they will give thee somewhat on
which we may live this day.” So he arose and went to his friends
one by one; but they all hid their faces from him and gave him
injurious words revolting to hear, but naught else; and he returned
to his wife and said to her, “They have given me nothing.”
Thereupon she went forth to beg of her neighbours the wherewithal
to keep themselves alive——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the wife
of Ali the Cairene, seeing her husband return empty-handed, went
forth to beg of her neighbours the wherewithal to keep themselves
alive and repaired to a woman, whom she had known in former
days. When she came in to her and she saw her case, she rose
and receiving her kindly, wept and said, “What hath befallen
you?” So she told her all that her husband had done, and the
other replied, “Well come and welcome and fair cheer!; whatever
thou needest, seek it of me, without price.” Quoth she, “Allah
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>requite thee abundantly!”<a id="r265"></a><a href="#f265" class="c011"><sup>[265]</sup></a> Then her friend gave her as much
provision as would suffice herself and her family a whole month,
and she took it and returned to her lodging. When her husband
saw her, he wept and asked, “Whence hadst thou that?”; and
she answered, “I got it of such a woman; for, when I told her
what had befallen us, she failed me not in aught, but said, Seek
of me all thou needest.” Whereupon her husband rejoined, “Since
thou hast this much I will betake myself to a place I have in my
mind; peradventure Allah Almighty will bring us relief.”<a id="r266"></a><a href="#f266" class="c011"><sup>[266]</sup></a> With
these words he took leave of her and kissed his children and went
out, not knowing whither he should go, and he continued walking
on till he came to Bulák, where he saw a ship about to sail for
Damietta.<a id="r267"></a><a href="#f267" class="c011"><sup>[267]</sup></a> Here he met a man, between whom and his father
there had been friendship, and he saluted him and said to him,
“Whither now?” Replied Ali, “To Damietta: I have friends
there, whom I would enquire after and visit them and then return.”
The man took him home and treated him honourably; then,
furnishing him with vivers for the voyage and giving him some
gold pieces, embarked him on board the vessel bound for
Damietta. When they reached it, Ali landed, not knowing
whither to go; but as he was walking along, a merchant saw him
and had pity on him, and carried him to his house. Here he
abode awhile, after which he said in himself, “How long this
sojourning in other folk’s homes?” Then he left the merchant’s
place and walked to the wharf where, after enquiry, he found a
ship ready to sail for Syria. His hospitable host provided him
with provision and embarked him in the ship; and it set sail and
Ali reached in due season the Syrian shores where he disembarked
and journeyed till he entered Damascus. As he walked about the
great thoroughfare behold, a kindly man saw him and took him to
his house, where he tarried for a time till, one day, going abroad,
he saw a caravan about to start for Baghdad and bethought himself
<span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>to journey thither with it. Thereupon he returned to his host and
taking leave of him, set out with the Cafilah. Now Allah (extolled
and exalted be He!) inclined to him the heart of one of the
merchants, so that he took him with him, and Ali ate and drank
with him, till they came within one day’s journey of Baghdad.
Here, however, a company of highwaymen fell upon the caravan
and took all they had and but few of the merchants escaped.
These made each for a separate place of refuge; but as for Ali the
Cairene he fared for Baghdad, where he arrived at sundown, as the
gatekeepers were about to shut the gates, and said to them, “Let
me in with you.” They admitted him and asked him, “Whence
come, and whither wending?” and he answered, “I am a man
from Cairo-city and have with me mules laden with merchandise
and slaves and servants. I forewent them, to look me out a place
wherein to deposit my goods: but, as I rode along on my she-mule,
there fell upon me a company of banditti, who took my
mule and gear; nor did I escape from them but at my last gasp.”
The gate-guard entreated him honourably and bade him be of
good cheer, saying, “Abide with us this night, and in the morning
we will look thee out a place befitting thee.” Then he sought in his
breast-pocket and, finding a dinar of those given to him by the merchant
at Bulak, handed it to one of the gatekeepers, saying, “Take
this and change it and bring us something to eat.” The man took
it and went to the market, where he changed it, and brought Ali
bread and cooked meat: so he ate, he and the gate-guards, and he
lay the night with them. Now on the morrow, one of the warders
carried him to a certain of the merchants of Baghdad, to whom he
told the same story, and he believed him, deeming that he was a
merchant and had with him loads of merchandise. Then he took
him up into his shop and entreated him with honour; moreover,
he sent to his house for a splendid suit of his own apparel for him
and carried him to the Hammam. So, quoth Ali of Cairo:—I
went with him to the bath, and when we came out, he took me
and brought me to his house, where he set the morning-meal
before us, and we ate and made merry. Then said he to one of
his black slaves, “Ho Mas’úd, take this thy lord: show him the
two houses standing in such a place, and whichever pleaseth him,
give him the key of it and come back.” So I went with the slave,
till we came to a street-road where stood three houses side by side,
newly built and yet shut up. He opened the first and I looked at
it; and we did the same to the second; after which he said to me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>“Of which shall I give thee the key?” “To whom doth the big
house belong?” “To us!” “Open it, that I may view it.”
“Thou hast no business there.” “Wherefore?” “Because it is
haunted, and none nighteth there but in the morning he is a dead
man; nor do we use to open the door, when removing the corpse,
but mount the terrace-roof of one of the other two houses and
take it up thence. For this reason my master hath abandoned the
house and saith:—I will never again give it to any one.” “Open
it,” I cried, “that I may view it;” and I said in my mind, “This
is what I seek; I will pass the night there and in the morning be
a dead man and be at peace from this my case.” So he opened
it and I entered and found it a splendid house, without its like;
and I said to the slave, “I will have none other than this house;
give me its key.” But he rejoined, “I will not give thee this key
till I consult my master,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the negro
(continued Ali of Cairo) rejoined, “I will not give thee its key
till I consult my master,” and going to him, reported, “The
Egyptian trader saith:—I will lodge in none but the big house.”
Now when the merchant heard this, he rose and coming to Ali,
spake thus to him, “O my lord, thou hast no need of this house.”
But he answered, “I will lodge in none other than this; for I care
naught for this silly saying.” Quoth the other, “Write me an
acknowledgment that, if aught happen to thee, I am not responsible.”
Quoth Ali, “So be it;” whereupon the merchant
fetched an assessor from the Kazi’s court and, taking the prescribed
acknowledgment, delivered to him the key wherewith he
entered the house. The merchant sent him bedding by a blackamoor
who spread it for him on the built bench behind the door<a id="r268"></a><a href="#f268" class="c011"><sup>[268]</sup></a>
and walked away. Presently Ali went about and, seeing in the
inner court a well with a bucket, let this down and drew water,
wherewith he made the lesser ablution and prayed the obligatory
prayers. Then he sat awhile, till the slave brought him the evening
meal from his master’s house, together with a lamp, a candle
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>and candlestick, a basin and ewer and a gugglet<a id="r269"></a><a href="#f269" class="c011"><sup>[269]</sup></a>; after which he
left him and returned home. Ali lighted the candle, supped at
his ease and prayed the night-prayer; and presently he said to
himself, “Come, take the bedding and go upstairs and sleep there;
‘twill be better than here.” So he took the bed and carried it
upstairs, where he found a splendid saloon, with gilded ceiling and
floor and walls cased with coloured marbles. He spread his bed
there and sitting down, began to recite somewhat of the Sublime
Koran, when (ere he was ware) he heard one calling to him and
asking, “O Ali, O son of Hasan, say me, shall I send thee down
the gold?” And he answered, “Where be the gold thou hast to
send?” But hardly had he spoken, when gold pieces began to
rain down on him, like stones from a catapult, nor ceased till the
saloon was full. Then, after the golden shower, said the Voice,
“Set me free, that I may go my way; for I have made an end
of my service and have delivered unto thee that which was
entrusted to me for thee.” Quoth Ali, “I adjure thee, by Allah
the Almighty, to tell me the cause of this gold-rain.” Replied the
Voice, “This is a treasure that was talisman’d to thee of old time,
and to every one who entered the house, we used to come and
say:—O Ali, O son of Hasan, shall we send thee down the gold?
Whereat he would be affrighted and cry out, and we would come
down to him and break his neck and go away. But, when thou
camest and we accosted thee by thy name and that of thy father,
saying, Shall we send thee down the gold? and thou madest answer
to us, And where be the gold? we knew thee for the owner of
it and sent it down. Moreover, there is yet another hoard for
thee in the land of Al-Yaman and thou wouldst do well to journey
thither and fetch it. And now I would fain have thee set me free,
that I may go my way.” Said Ali, “By Allah, I will not set thee
free, till thou bring me hither the treasure from the land of Al-Yaman!”
Said the Voice, “An I bring it to thee, wilt thou release
me and eke the servant of the other hoard?” “Yes,” replied Ali,
and the Voice cried, “Swear to me.” So he swore to him, and he
was about to go away, when Ali said to him, “I have one other
need to ask of thee;” and he, “What is that?” Quoth Ali, “I
have a wife and children at Cairo in such a place; thou needs
must fetch them to me, at their ease and without their unease.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>Quoth he, “I will bring them to thee in a mule-litter<a id="r270"></a><a href="#f270" class="c011"><sup>[270]</sup></a> and much
state, with a train of eunuchs and servants, together with the
treasure from Al-Yaman, Inshallah!”<a id="r271"></a><a href="#f271" class="c011"><sup>[271]</sup></a> Then he took of him leave
of absence for three days, when all this should be with him, and
vanished. As soon as it was morning Ali went round about the
saloon, seeking a place wherein to store the gold, and saw on the edge
of the dais a marble slab with a turning-pin; so he turned the pin
and the slab sank and showed a door which he opened and entering,
found a great closet, full of bags of coarse stuff carefully sewn.
So he began taking out the bags and fell to filling them with gold
and storing them in the closet, till he had transported thither all
the hoarded gold, whereupon he shut the door and turning the
pin, the slab returned to its place. Then he went down and seated
himself on the bench behind the door; and presently there came
a knock; so he opened and found the merchant’s slave who, seeing
him comfortably sitting, returned in haste to his master——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
house-owner’s black slave returned and knocked at the door, Ali
the Cairene, son of the merchant Hasan, opened it to him and the
negro, seeing him comfortably sitting, returned in haste to his
master with the good tidings, saying, “O my Lord, the merchant,
who is lodged in the house inhabited by the Jinn,<a id="r272"></a><a href="#f272" class="c011"><sup>[272]</sup></a> is alive and
well and sitteth on the bench behind the door.” Then the merchant
rose joyfully and went to the house, taking breakfast with
him; and, when he saw Ali, he embraced him and kissed him
between the eyes, asking, “How hath Allah dealt with thee?”;
and Ali answered, “Right well, I slept upstairs in the marble
saloon.” Quoth the merchant, “Did aught come to thee or didst
thou see any thing?” and quoth Ali, “No, I recited some little of
the Sublime Koran and slept till morning, when I arose and, after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>making the minor ablution and praying, seated myself on the
bench behind the door.” “Praised be Allah for safety!” exclaimed
the merchant, then left him and presently sent him black
slaves and white Mamelukes and handmaidens with household
gear. They swept the house from top to bottom and furnished it
with magnificent furniture; after which three white slaves and
three blacks and four slave-girls remained with him, to serve him,
while the rest returned to their master’s house. Now when the
merchants heard of him, they sent him presents of all manner
things of price, even to food and drink and clothes, and took him
with them to the market, asking, “When will thy baggage arrive?”
And he answered, “After three days it will surely come.” When
the term had elapsed, the servant of the first hoard, the golden
rain, came to him and said, “Go forth and meet the treasure I
have brought thee from Al-Yaman together with thy Harim; for
I bring part of the wealth in the semblance of costly merchandise;
but the eunuchs and Mamelukes and the mules and horses and
camels are all of the Jánn.” Now the Jinni, when he betook
himself to Cairo, found Ali’s wife and children in sore misery,
naked and hungry; so he carried them out of the city in a travelling-litter
and clad them in sumptuous raiment of the stuffs which
were in the treasure of Al-Yaman. So when Ali heard this, he
arose and repairing to the merchants, said to them, “Rise and go
forth with us from the city, to meet the caravan bringing my
merchandise, and honour us with the presence of your Harims, to
meet my Harim.” “Hearkening and obedience,” answered they
and, sending for their Harims, went forth all together and took
seat in one of the city-gardens; and as they sat talking, behold, a
dust-cloud arose out of the heart of the desert, and they flocked
forth to see what it was. Presently it lifted and discovered mules
and muleteers, tent-pitchers and linkmen, who came on, singing
and dancing, till they reached the garden, when the chief of the
muleteers walked up to Ali and kissing his hand, said to him, “O
my master, we have been long on the way, for we purposed entering
yesterday; but we were in fear of the bandits, so abode in our
station four days, till Almighty Allah rid us of them.” Thereupon
the merchants mounted their mules and rode forward with
the caravan, the Harims waiting behind, till Ali’s wife and
children mounted with them; and they all entered in splendid
train. The merchants marvelled at the number of mules laden
with chests, whilst the women of the merchants wondered at the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>richness of the apparel of his wife and the fine raiment of her
children; and kept saying each to other, “Verily, the King of
Baghdad hath no such gear; no, nor any other of the kings or
lords or merchants!” So they ceased not to fare forwards in
high great state, the men with Ali of Cairo and the Harims with
his Harim, till they came to the mansion,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they ceased
not to fare forwards in high state, the men with Ali’s men and the
women with his wife, till they came to the mansion, where they
alighted and brought the mules and their burdens into the midst
of the courtyard. Then they unloaded them and warehoused the
goods whilst the merchants’ wives went up with Ali’s family to
the saloon, which they found as it were a luxuriant garden, spread
with magnificent furniture. They sat in mirth and good cheer till
noon, when they brought them up the midday meal, all manner
meats and sweetmeats of the very best; and they ate and drank
costly sherbets and perfumed themselves thereafter with rose-water
and scented woods. Then they took leave and went home,
men and women; and, when the merchants returned to their
places, they sent presents to the husband according to their
conditions; and their wives likewise sent presents to the wife, so
that there came to them great store of handmaids and negroes
and Mamelukes; and all kinds of goods, such as grain, sugar and
so forth, in abundance beyond account. As for the Baghdad
merchant, the landlord of the house, he abode with Ali and
quitted him not, but said to him, “Let the black slaves and servants
take the mules and the common cattle into one of my other
houses, to rest.” Quoth Ali, “They set out again to-night for
such a place.” Then he gave them leave to go forth and camp
outside the city, that they might start on their journey at night-come;
whereupon, hardly believing that they were dismissed, they
took leave of him and departing to the outliers of the city, flew
off through the air to their several abodes. So Ali and his house-owner
sat together till a third of the night was past, when their
colloquy ended and the merchant returned to his own house and
Ali went up to his wife and children and after saluting them, said,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>“What hath befallen you in my absence all this time?” So she
told him what they had suffered of hunger and nakedness and
travail, and he said, “Praised be Allah for safety! How did ye
come?” Answered she, “O my lord, I was asleep with my
children yesternight, when suddenly and unexpectedly one raised
us from the ground and flew with us through the firmament without
doing us any hurt, nor did he leave flying with us, till he set
us down in a place as it were an Arab camping-ground, where
we saw laden mules and a travelling litter borne upon two great
mules, and around it servants, all boys and men. So I asked them:—Who
are ye and what are these loads and where are we?; and
they answered:—We are the servants of the merchant Ali of
Cairo, son of the merchant-jeweller, who hath sent us to fetch
you to him at Baghdad. Quoth I, Tell me, is it far or near, hence
to Baghdad? They replied, Near: there lieth between us and the
city but the darkness of the night. Then they mounted us in the
litter and, when the morrow dawned, we found ourselves with thee,
without having suffered any hurt whatever.” Quoth he, “Who
gave you these dresses;” and quoth she, “The chief of the
caravan opened one of the boxes on the mules and taking out
thereof these clothes, clad me and thy children each in a suit;
after which he locked the case and gave me the key, saying, Take
care of it, till thou give it to thy husband. And here it is safe by
me.” So saying, she gave him the key, and he said, “Dost thou
know the chest?” Said she, “Yes, I know it.” So he took her
down to the magazine and showed her the boxes, when she cried,
“This is the one whence the dresses were taken;” upon which he
put the key in the lock and opened the chest, wherein he found
much raiment and the keys of all the other cases. So he took
them and fell to opening them, one after another, and feasting his
eyes upon the gems and precious ores they contained, whose like
was not found with any of the kings; after which he locked them
again, took the keys, and returned to the saloon, saying to his
wife, “This is of the bounty of Almighty Allah!” Then bringing
her to the secret slab he turned the pin and opened the door of
the closet, into which he entered with her and showed her the gold
he had laid up therein. Quoth she, “Whence came all this to
thee?” “It came to me by the grace of my Lord,” answered he:——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Ali’s
wife had looked upon the gold she said to him, “Whence came all
this to thee?” “It came to me by the grace of my Lord,”
answered he: “When I left thee in my trouble, I shipped at
Bulak for Damietta and met a friend there who forwarded me
to Damascus”: in brief he told her all that had befallen him, from
first to last. Said she, “O my lord, all this cometh by boon of thy
father’s blessing and orisons when he prayed for thee, before his
death, saying:—I beseech Allah to cast thee into no straits except
He grant thee ready relief! So praised be Allah Almighty for
that He hath brought thee deliverance and hath requited thee
with more than went from thee! But Allah upon thee, O my
lord, return not to thy practice of associating with doubtful folk;
but look thou fear Allah (whose name be exalted!) both in private
and in public.” And as she went on to admonish him, he said,
“I accept thine admonition and beg the Almighty to remove the
froward from amongst us and stablish us in His obedience and
in the observance of the law and practice of His Prophet, on
whom be blessings and peace!” After that Ali and his wife and
children were in all solace of life and gladness; and he opened
him a shop in the merchants’ bazar and, stocking it with a somewhat
of jewels and bullion, sat therein with his children and white
servants. Presently he became the most considerable of the
merchants of Baghdad, and his report reached the King of that
city,<a id="r273"></a><a href="#f273" class="c011"><sup>[273]</sup></a> who sent a messenger to command his attendance, saying,
“Answer the summons of the King who requireth thee.” He
replied, “I hear and obey,” and straightway prepared his present
and he took four trays of red gold and, filling them with jewels
and precious metals, such as no King possessed, went up to the
palace and presenting himself before the presence, kissed the
ground between his hands and wished him endurance of goods and
glory in the finest language he could command. Said the King,
“O merchant, thou cheerest our city with thy presence!” and Ali
rejoined, “O King of the age, thy slave hath brought thee a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_179">179</span>gift and hopeth for acceptance thereof from thy favour.” Then
he laid the four trays before the King, who uncovered them and
seeing that they contained gems, whose fellows he possessed not
and whose worth equalled treasuries of money, said, “Thy present
is accepted, O merchant, and Inshallah! we will requite thee with
its like.” And Ali kissed his hands and went away; whereupon
the King called his grandees and said to them, “How many of
the Kings have sought my daughter in marriage?” “Many,”
answered they; and he asked, “Hath any of them given me the
like of this gift?”; whereto they replied, “Not one, for that none
of them hath its like;” and he said, “I have consulted Allah
Almighty by lot as to marrying my daughter to this merchant.
What say ye?” “Be it as thou reckest,” answered they. Then
he bade the eunuch carry the four trays into his serraglio and
going in to his wife, laid them before her. She uncovered them
and seeing therein that whose like she possessed not; no, nor a
fraction thereof, said to him, “From which of the Kings hadst
thou these?: perchance of one of the royalties that seek thy
daughter in marriage?” Said he, “Not so, I had them of an
Egyptian merchant, who is lately come to this our city. Now
when I heard of his coming I sent to command him to us, thinking
to make his acquaintance, so haply we might find with him somewhat
of jewels and buy them of him for our daughter’s trousseau.
He obeyed our summons and brought us these four trays, as a
present, and I saw him to be a handsome youth of dignified
aspect and intelligent as elegant, almost such as should be the
sons of Kings. Wherefore my heart inclined to him at sight, and
my heart rejoiced in him and I thought good to marry my daughter
to him. So I showed the gift to my grandees, who agreed
with me that none of the Kings hath the like of these and I told
them my project. But what sayst thou?”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
King of Baghdad, after showing the presents to his wife and
highly praising Ali, the merchant-jeweller, and informing her of
the proposed marriage, asked, “But what sayst thou?” She replied,
“O King of the age, the ordering this affair is in Allah’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>hand, and thine, and whatso Allah willeth shall come to pass.”
Rejoined the King, “If it be His will, I will marry her to none
other than this young man.” He slept on this resolve and on
the morrow, he went out to his Divan and summoned Ali and
the rest of the merchants of Baghdad, and when all came bade
them be seated. Then said he, “Bring me the Kazi of the Divan”
and they brought him; whereupon the King said to him, “O
Kazi, write the contract of marriage between my daughter and
the merchant Ali the Cairene.” But Ali said, “Thy pardon, O
our lord the Sultan! It befitteth not that a trader such as I, be
the King’s son-in-law.” Quoth the King, “It is my will to bestow
this favour upon thee, as well as the Wazirate;” and he invested
him forthwith in the Wazir’s office and ministerial robes. Then
Ali sat down in the chair of the Wazirate and said, “O King of
the age, thou hast bestowed on me this; and indeed I am
honoured by thy bounties; but hear one word I have to say to
thee!” He replied, “Say on, and fear not.” Quoth Ali, “Since it
is thine august resolution to marry thy daughter, thou wouldst do
better to marry her to my son.” Quoth the King, “Hast thou then
a son?”; and Ali replied, “Yes.” “Send for him forthwith,” said
the King. Thereupon answered Ali, “Hearkening and obedience!”,
and despatched a servant to fetch his son, who came and kissing
the ground before the King, stood in an attitude of respect. The
King looked at him and seeing him to be yet comelier than his
daughter and goodlier than she in stature and proportion and
brightness and perfection, said to him, “What is thy name, O my
son?” “My name is Hasan, O our lord the Sultan,” replied the
young man, who was then fourteen years old. Then the Sultan
said to the Kazi, “Write the contract of marriage between my
daughter Husn al-Wujúd and Hasan, son of the merchant Ali
the Cairene.” So he wrote the marriage-contract between them,
and the affair was ended in the goodliest fashion; after which all in
the Divan went their ways and the merchants followed the Wazir
Ali, escorting him to his house, where they gave him joy of his
advancement and departed. Then he went in to his wife, who
seeing him clad in the Wazir’s habit, exclaimed, “What is this?”;
when he told her all that had passed from first to last and she
joyed therein with exceeding joy. So sped the night and on the
morrow, he went up to the Divan, where the King received him
with especial favour and seating him close by his side, said, “O
Wazir, we purpose to begin the wedding festivities and bring thy son
<span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>in to our daughter.” Replied Ali, “O our lord the Sultan, whatso
thou deemest good is good.” So the Sultan gave orders to celebrate
the festivities, and they decorated the city and held high
festival for thirty days, in all joy and gladness; at the end of which
time, Hasan, son of the Wazir Ali, went in to the Princess and
enjoyed her beauty and loveliness. When the Queen saw her
daughter’s husband, she conceived a warm affection for him, and
in like manner she rejoiced greatly in his mother. Then the King
bade build for his son-in-law Hasan Ali-son a palace beside his
own; so they built him with all speed a splendid palace in which
he took up his abode; and his mother used to tarry with him some
days and then go down to her own house. After awhile the Queen
said to her husband, “O King of the age, Hasan’s lady-mother
cannot take up her abode with her son and leave the Wazir;
neither can she tarry with the Wazir and leave her son.” “Thou
sayest sooth,” replied the King, and bade edify a third palace
beside that of Hasan, which being done in a few days he caused
remove thither the goods of the Wazir, and the Minister and his
wife took up their abode there. Now the three palaces communicated
with one another, so that when the King had a mind to
speak with the Wazir by night, he would go to him or send to
fetch him; and so with Hasan and his father and mother. On
this wise they dwelt in all solace and in the greatest happiness——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-third Night,</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King
and the Wazir and his son ceased not to dwell in all solace and
in the greatest happiness awhile, till the King fell ill and his sickness
grew on him. So he summoned the lords of his realm and
said to them, “There is come upon me a sore malady, peradventure
a mortal; and I have therefore summoned you to consult you
respecting a certain matter, on which I would have you counsel me
as you deem well.” They asked, “What is the matter of which
thou wouldst take counsel with us, O King?”; and he answered,
“I am old and sickly and I fear for the realm after me from its
enemies; so I would have you all agree upon some one, that I
may proclaim him King in my lifetime and so ye may be at ease.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_182">182</span>Whereupon quoth they with one voice, “We all approve of thy
daughter’s husband Hasan, son of the Wazir Ali; for we have
seen his wit and perfect understanding, and he knoweth the place
of all, great and small.” Asked the King, “Are ye indeed agreed
upon this?” and they answered, “Yes.” Rejoined he “Peradventure
ye all say this to my face, of respect for me; but behind my
back ye will say otherwise.” However, they all replied, “By Allah,
our word is one and the same in public and in private, and we accept
him frankly and with heartiness of heart and breadth of breast.”
Quoth he, “Since the case is thus, bring the Kazi of the Holy
Law and all the Chamberlains and Viceroys and Officers of state
before me to-morrow, and we will order the affair after the goodliest
fashion.” “We hear and we obey,” answered they and withdrawing,
notified all the Olema,<a id="r274"></a><a href="#f274" class="c011"><sup>[274]</sup></a> the doctors of the law and the
chief personages among the Emirs. So when the morrow dawned,
they came up to the Divan and having craved and obtained permission
to enter, they saluted the King, saying, “Here are we all
in thy presence.” Whereto he made reply, “O Emirs of Baghdad,
whom will ye have to be King over you after me, that I
may inaugurate him during my lifetime, before the presence of
you all?” Quoth they with one voice, “We are agreed upon thy
daughter’s husband Hasan, son of the Wazir Ali.” Quoth he,
“If it be so, go all of you and bring him before me.” So they all
arose and, repairing to Hasan’s palace, said to him, “Rise, come
with us to the King.” “Wherefore?” asked he, and they answered,
“For a thing that will benefit both us and thee.” So he went
in with them to the King and kissed the ground before his
father-in-law who said to him, “Be seated, O my son!” He sat
down and the King continued, “O Hasan, all the Emirs have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>approved of thee and agreed to make thee King over them after
me; and it is my purpose to proclaim thee, whilst I yet live, and so
make an end of the business.” But Hasan stood up and, kissing
the ground once more before the King, said to him, “O our lord
the King, among the Emirs there be many who are older than I
and greater of worth; acquit me therefore of this thing.” But all
the Emirs cried out saying, “We consent not but that thou be
King over us.” Then said Hasan, “My father is older than I, and
I and he are one thing; and it befits not to advance me over him.”
But Ali said, “I will consent to nothing save whatso contenteth my
brethren; and they have all chosen and agreed upon thee; wherefore
gainsay thou not the King’s commandment and that of thy
brethren.” And Hasan hung his head abashed before the King and
his father. Then said the King to the Emirs, “Do ye all accept of
him?” “We do,” answered they and recited thereupon seven
Fátihahs.<a id="r275"></a><a href="#f275" class="c011"><sup>[275]</sup></a> So the King said, “O Kazi, draw up a legal instrument
testifying of these Emirs that they are agreed to make King over
them my daughter’s husband Hasan.” The Kazi wrote the act and
made it binding on all men,<a id="r276"></a><a href="#f276" class="c011"><sup>[276]</sup></a> after they had sworn in a body the
oath of fealty to Hasan. Then the King did likewise and bade
him take his seat on the throne of kingship; whereupon they all
arose and kissed King Hasan’s hands and did homage to him, and
swore lealty to him. And the new King dispensed justice among
the people that day in fashion right royal, and invested the grandees
of the realm in splendid robes of honour. When the Divan broke
up, he went in to and kissed the hands of his father-in-law who
spake thus to him, “O my son, look thou rule the lieges in the
fear of Allah;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
King Hasan was quit of the Divan, he went in to and kissed the
hands of his wife’s father, who spake thus to him, “O my son,
look thou rule the lieges in the fear of Allah;” whereto he replied,
“O my father, through thy prayers for me, the grace and guidance
of Allah will come to me.” Then he entered his own palace and
was met by his wife and her mother and their attendants, who
kissed his hands and gave him joy of his advancement, saying,
“Be this day blessed!” Next he went in to his father and
mother, who joyed with exceeding joy in that which Allah had
vouchsafed him of his advancement to the kingship, and his
father charged him to fear Allah and to deal mercifully with his
subjects. He passed the night in glee and gladness, and on the
morrow, having prayed the obligatory prayers ending with the
usual short chapters<a id="r277"></a><a href="#f277" class="c011"><sup>[277]</sup></a> of the Koran, he went up to the Divan,
whither came all his officers and dignitaries. He passed the day
in dispensing justice among the folk, bidding to graciousness and
forbidding ungraciousness and appointing to place and displacing,
till day-end, when the Divan broke up, after the goodliest fashion,
and all the troops withdrew and each went his own way. Then
he arose and repaired to the palace, where he found his father-in-law’s
sickness grown heavy upon him and said to him, “May
no ill befal thee!” At this the old King opened his eyes and
said, “O Hasan!” and he replied, “At thy service, O my lord.”
Quoth the old King, “Mine appointed hour is at hand: be thou
careful of thy wife and her mother, and look thou fear Allah and
honour thy parents; and bide in awe of the majesty of the
Requiting King and bear in mind that He commandeth justice
and good works.” And King Hasan replied, “I hear and obey.”
Now after this the old King lingered three days and then departed
into the mercy of Almighty Allah. So they laid him
out and shrouded and buried him and held over him readings
and perlections of the Koran, to the end of the customary forty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>days. And King Hasan, son of the Wazir, reigned in his stead,
and his subjects joyed in him and all his days were gladness;
moreover, his father ceased not to be his chief Wazir on his right
hand, and he took to himself another Wazir, to be at his left
hand. His reign was a prosperous and well ordered, and he lived
a long life as King of Baghdad; and Allah blessed him, by the old
King’s daughter, with three sons who inherited the kingdom after
him; and they abode in the solace of life and its pleasures till
there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of
societies. And glory be to Him who is eternal and in whose
hand are annulling and confirming. And of the tales they tell

the Olema in Al-Islam formed themselves into a kind of clergy; with the single but
highly important difference that they must (or ought to) live by some honest secular
calling and not by the “cure of souls”; hence Mahomet IV. of Turkey was solemnly
deposed. So far and no farther Mohammed was successful and his success has secured
for him the lively and lasting hatred of the ecclesiastical caste which he so honestly and
wisely attempted to abate. Even to the present day missionaries have a good word for
the Guebre and the Buddhist, the Brahmanist and the Confucian, but none for the Moslem:

</div>

<p class="c012">A man of the pilgrims once slept a long sleep and awaking, found
no trace of the caravan. So he rose up and walked on, but lost
his way and presently came to a tent, where he saw an old
woman standing at the entrance and by her side a dog asleep.
He went up to the tent and, saluting the old woman, sought of
her food, when she replied, “Go to yonder Wady and catch thy
sufficiency of serpents, that I may broil of them for thee and give
thee to eat.” Rejoined the pilgrim, “I dare not catch serpents
nor did I ever eat them.” Quoth the old woman, “I will go with
thee and catch some; fear not.” So she went with him, followed
by the dog, to the valley and, catching a sufficient number of
serpents, proceeded to broil them. He saw nothing for it (saith
the story teller) but to eat, in fear of hunger and exhaustion; so
he ate of the serpents.<a id="r278"></a><a href="#f278" class="c011"><sup>[278]</sup></a> Then he was athirst and asked for water
to drink; and she answered, “Go to the spring and drink.” Accordingly,
he went to the spring and found the water thereof bitter;
yet needs must he drink of it despite its bitterness, because of
the violence of his thirst. Presently he returned to the old woman
and said to her, “I marvel, O ancient dame, at thy choosing to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>sojourn in this place”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
palmer-man drank the bitter draught for stress of thirst, he
returned and said “I marvel, O ancient dame, at thy choosing
to sojourn in this place and thy putting up with such meat and
drink!” She asked, “And how is it then in thy country?”;
whereto he answered, “In my country are houses wide and
spacious and fruits ripe and delicious and waters sweet and
viands savorous and of goodly use and meats fat and full of
juice and flocks innumerous and all things pleasant and all the
goods of life, the like whereof are not, save in the Paradise which
Allah the Omnipotent hath promised to His servants pious.”
Replied she, “All this have I heard: but tell me, have ye a
Sultan who ruleth over you and is tyrannical in his rule and
under whose hand you are; one who, if any of you commit an
offence, taketh his goods and ruineth him and who, whenas he
will, turneth you out of house and home and uprooteth you, stock
and branch?” Replied the man, “Indeed that may be;” and she
rejoined, “If so, by Allah, these your delicious food and life of
dainty-hood and gifts however good, with tyranny and oppression,
are but a searching poison, while our coarse meat which in
freedom and safety we eat is a healthful medicine. Hast thou
not heard that the best of boons, after Al-Islam, the true Faith,
are sanity and security?”<a id="r279"></a><a href="#f279" class="c011"><sup>[279]</sup></a> Now such boons (quoth he who
telleth the tale) may be by the just rule of the Sultan, Vice-regent
of Allah on His earth, and the goodness of his polity.
The Sultan of time past needed but little awfulness, for when
the lieges saw him, they feared him; but the Sultan of these
days hath need of the most accomplished polity and the utmost
majesty, because men are not as men of by-gone time and this
our age is one of folk opprobrious, and is greatly calamitous,
noted for folly and hardness of heart and inclined to hate and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>enmity. If, therefore, the Sultan (which Almighty Allah forfend!)
be weak or wanting in polity and majesty, this will be the
assured cause of his country’s ruin. Quoth the proverb, “An
hundred years of the Sultan’s tyranny, but not one year of the
people’s tyranny one over other.” When the lieges oppress one
another, Allah setteth over them a tyrannical Sultan and a terrible
King. Thus it is told in history that one day there was sent to
Al-Hajjáj bin Yúsuf a slip of paper, whereon was written, “Fear
Allah and oppress not His servants with all manner of oppression.”
When he read this, he mounted the pulpit (for he was
eloquent and ever ready of speech), and said, “O folk, Allah
Almighty hath made me ruler over you, by reason of your
frowardness;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day

  <h2 id="c189" class="c007">ABU AL-HUSN AND HIS SLAVE-GIRL TAWADDUD.<a id="r281"></a><a href="#f281" class="c011"><sup>[281]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once in Baghdad a man of consequence and rich in
monies and immoveables, who was one of the chiefs of the
merchants; and Allah had largely endowed him with worldly
goods, but had not vouchsafed him what he longed for of
offspring; and there passed over him a long space of time,
without his being blessed with issue, male or female. His years
waxed great; his bones became wasted and his back bent;
weakness and weariness grew upon him, and he feared the loss
of his wealth and possessions, seeing he had no child whom he
might make his heir and by whom his name should be remembered.
So he betook himself with supplication to Almighty
Allah, fasting by day and praying through the night. Moreover,
he vowed many vows to the Living, the Eternal; and
visited the pious and was constant in supplication to the Most
Highest, till He gave ear to him and accepted his prayer and
took pity on his straining and complaining; so that, before
many days were past, he knew carnally one of his women and she
conceived by him the same night. In due time she finished her
months and, casting her burden, bore a male child as he were
a slice of the moon; whereupon the merchant fulfilled his vows
in his gratitude to Allah, (to whom be honour and glory!) and
gave alms and clothed the widow and the orphan. On the
seventh night after the boy’s birth, he named him Abu al-Husn,<a id="r282"></a><a href="#f282" class="c011"><sup>[282]</sup></a>
and the wet-nurses suckled him and the dry-nurses dandled
him and the servants and the slaves carried him and handled
him, till he shot up and grew tall and throve greatly and learnt
the Sublime Koran and the ordinances of Al-Islam and the
canons of the True Faith; and calligraphy and poetry and
mathematics and archery. On this wise he became the union-pearl
of his age and the goodliest of the folk of his time and
his day; fair of face and of tongue fluent, carrying himself with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>a light and graceful gait and glorying in his stature proportionate
and amorous graces which were to many a bait: and his cheeks
were red and flower-white was his forehead and his side face
waxed brown with tender down, even as saith one, describing
him:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The spring of the down on cheeks right clearly shows: ✿ And how when the Spring is gone shall last the rose?</div>
      <div class="line">Dost thou not see that the growth upon his cheek ✿ Is violet-bloom that from its leaves outgrows.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">He abode awhile in ease and happiness with his father, who
rejoiced and delighted in him, till he came to man’s estate,
when the merchant one day made him sit down before him and
said, “O my son, the appointed term draweth near; my hour of
death is at hand and it remaineth but to meet Allah (to whom
belong Majesty and Might!). I leave thee what shall suffice thee,
even to thy son’s son, of monies and mansions, farms and gardens;
wherefore, fear thou Almighty Allah, O my son, in dealing with
that which I bequeath to thee and follow none but those who will
help thee to the Divine favour.” Not long after, he sickened and
died; so his son ordered his funeral,<a id="r283"></a><a href="#f283" class="c011"><sup>[283]</sup></a> after the goodliest wise, and
burying him, returned to his house and sat mourning for him
many days and nights. But behold, certain of his friends came
in to him and said to him, “Whoso leaveth a son like thee is not
dead; indeed, what is past is past and fled and mourning beseemeth
none but the young maid and the wife cloistered.” And
they ceased not from him till they wrought on him to enter the
Hammam and break off his mourning.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Abu
al-Husn was visited by his friends and taken to the Hammam
<span class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>and persuaded to break off his mourning, he presently forgot his
father’s charge, and his head was turned by his riches; he thought
fortune would always wone with him as it was, and that wealth
would ever wax and never wane. So he ate and drank and made
merry and took his pleasure and gave gifts of gear and coin and
was profuse with gold and addrest himself up to eating fowls and
breaking the seals of wine-flasks and listening to the giggle of the
daughter of the vine, as she gurgled from the flagon and enjoying
the jingle of the singing-girls; nor did he give over this way of
life, till his wealth was wasted and the case worsened and all his
goods went from him and he bit his hands<a id="r284"></a><a href="#f284" class="c011"><sup>[284]</sup></a> in bitter penitence.
For of a truth he had nothing left, after that which he had squandered,
but a concubine, a slave-girl whom his father had bequeathed
to him with the rest of his estate: and she had no equal in beauty
and loveliness and brightness and liveliness and symmetric stature
and perfect grace. She was past mistress in every manner of arts
and accomplishments and endowed with many excellences, surpassing
all the folk of her age and time. She was grown more
notorious than a way-mark,<a id="r285"></a><a href="#f285" class="c011"><sup>[285]</sup></a> for her seductive genius, and outdid
the fair both in theory and practice, and she was noted for her
swimming gait, flexile and delicate, albeit she was full five feet
in height and by all the boons of fortune deckt and dight, with
strait arched brows twain, as they were the crescent moon of
Sha’abán,<a id="r286"></a><a href="#f286" class="c011"><sup>[286]</sup></a> and eyes like gazelles’ eyne; and nose like the edge
of scymitar fine and cheeks like anemones of blood-red shine;
and mouth like Solomon’s seal and sign and teeth like necklaces
of pearls in line; and navel holding an ounce of oil of benzoin
and waist more slender than his body whom love hath wasted
and whom concealment hath made sick with pine and hind parts
heavier than two hills of sand; briefly she was a volume of charms
after his saying who saith:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She seemed a full moon rising and a gazelle browsing, a girl of
nine plus five<a id="r288"></a><a href="#f288" class="c011"><sup>[288]</sup></a> shaming the moon and sun, even as saith of her

<p class="c000">Clean of skin, odoriferous of breath, it seemed as if she were of
fire fashioned and of crystal moulded; rose-red was the cheek of
her and perfect the shape and form of her; even as one saith of
her, describing her:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Scented with sandal<a id="r290"></a><a href="#f290" class="c011"><sup>[290]</sup></a> and musk, right proudly doth she go, ✿ With gold and rose and saffron-colour aglow.</div>
      <div class="line">A flower in a garden she is, a pearl in an ouch of gold ✿ Or an image in chapel<a id="r291"></a><a href="#f291" class="c011"><sup>[291]</sup></a> set for worship of high and low.</div>
      <div class="line">Slender and shapely she is; vivacity bids her arise, ✿ But the weight of her hips says, “Sit, or softly and slowly go.”</div>
      <div class="line">Whenas her favours I seek and sue for my heart’s desire, ✿ “Be gracious,” her beauty says; but her coquetry answers, “No.”</div>
      <div class="line">Glory to Him who made beauty her portion, and that ✿ Of her lover to be the prate of the censurers, heigho!<a id="r292"></a><a href="#f292" class="c011"><sup>[292]</sup></a></div>
    </div>

<p class="c000">She captivated all who saw her, with the excellence of her beauty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>and the sweetness of her smile,<a id="r293"></a><a href="#f293" class="c011"><sup>[293]</sup></a> and shot them down with the
shafts she launched from her eyes; and withal she was eloquent
of speech and excellently skilled in verse. Now when Abu al-Husn
had squandered all his gold, and his ill-plight all could
behold, and there remained to him naught save this slave-girl, he
abode three days without tasting meat or taking rest in sleep, and
the handmaid said to him, “O my lord, carry me to the Commander
of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid,”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
slave-girl to her master, “O my lord, carry me to Harun al-Rashid,
fifth of the sons of Abbas, and seek of him to my price ten
thousand dinars. If he deem me dear, say to him:—O Prince of
True Believers, my handmaid is worth more than this: do but
prove her, and her value will be magnified in thine eyes; for this
slave-girl hath not her equal, and she were unfit to any but thou.”
And she added, “Beware, O my lord, of selling me at less than
the sum I have named; indeed ‘tis but little for the like of me.”
Now her owner knew not her worth nor that she had no equal in
her day; but he carried her to the Caliph and set her in the presence
and repeated what she had bidden him say. The Caliph
asked her, “What is thy name?”; to which she answered, “My
name is Tawaddud.”<a id="r294"></a><a href="#f294" class="c011"><sup>[294]</sup></a> He then enquired, “O Tawaddud, in what
branches of knowledge dost thou excel?”; and she replied, “O
my lord, I am versed in syntax and poetry and jurisprudence and
exegesis and philosophy; and I am skilled in music and the
knowledge of the Divine ordinances and in arithmetic and
geodesy and geometry and the fables of the ancients. I know
the Sublime Koran by heart and have read it according to the
seven, the ten and the fourteen modes. I know the number of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>its chapters and versets and sections and words; and its halves and
fourths and eighths and tenths; the number of prostrations which
occur in it and the sum total of its letters; and I know what there
is in it of abrogating and abrogated<a id="r295"></a><a href="#f295" class="c011"><sup>[295]</sup></a>; also what parts of it were
revealed at Al-Medinah and what at Meccah and the cause of the
different revelations. I know the Holy Traditions of the Apostle’s
sayings, historical and legendary, the established and those whose
ascription is doubtful; and I have studied the exact sciences,
geometry and philosophy and medicine and logic and rhetoric and
composition; and I have learnt many things by rote and am passionately
fond of poetry. I can play the lute and know its gamut
and notes and notation and the crescendo and diminuendo. If I
sing and dance, I seduce, and if I dress and scent myself, I slay.
In fine, I have reached a pitch of perfection such as can be estimated
only by those of them who are firmly rooted in knowledge.”<a id="r296"></a><a href="#f296" class="c011"><sup>[296]</sup></a>
Now when the Caliph heard these words spoken by one
so young, he wondered at her eloquence, and turning to Abu al-Husn,
said, “I will summon those who shall discuss with her all
she claimeth to know; if she answer correctly, I will give thee the
price thou askest for her and more; and if not, thou art fitter to
have her than I.” “With gladness and goodly gree, O Commander
of the Faithful,” replied Abu al-Husn. So the Caliph wrote to
the Viceroy of Bassorah, to send him Ibrahim bin Siyyár the
prosodist, who was the first man of his day in argument and eloquence
and poetry and logic, and bade him bring with him readers
of the Koran and learned doctors of the law and physicians and
astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and philosophers;
and Ibrahim was more learned than all. In a little while they
arrived at the palace of the Caliphate, knowing not what was to
do, and the Caliph sent for them to his sitting-chamber and ordered
them to be seated. So they sat down and he bade bring the damsel
Tawaddud, who came and unveiling, showed herself, as she were
a sparkling star.<a id="r297"></a><a href="#f297" class="c011"><sup>[297]</sup></a> The Caliph set her a stool of gold; and she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>saluted, and speaking with an eloquent tongue, said, “O Commander
of the Faithful, bid the Olema and the doctors of law and
leaches and astrologers and scientists and mathematicians and all
here present contend with me in argument.” So he said to them,
“I desire of you that ye dispute with this damsel on the things of
her faith, and stultify her argument in all she advanceth;” and
they answered, saying, “We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O
Commander of the Faithful.” Upon this Tawaddud bowed her
head and said, “Which of you is the doctor of the law, the scholar,
versed in the readings of the Koran and in the Traditions?”
Quoth one of them, “I am the man thou seekest.” Quoth she,
“Then ask me of what thou wilt.” Said the doctor, “Hast thou
read the precious book of Allah and dost thou know its cancelling
and cancelled parts and hast thou meditated its versets and
its letters?” “Yes,” answered she. “Then,” said he, “I will
proceed to question thee of the obligations and the immutable
ordinances: so tell me of these, O damsel, and who is thy Lord,
who thy prophet, who thy Guide, what is thy point of fronting in
prayer, and who be thy brethren? Also what thy spiritual path
and what thy highway?” Whereto she replied, “Allah is my
Lord, and Mohammed (whom Allah save and assain!) my prophet,
and the Koran is my guide and the Ka’abah my fronting; and
the True-believers are my brethren. The practice of good is my
path and the Sunnah my highway.” The Caliph again marvelled
at her words so eloquently spoken by one so young; and the
doctor pursued, “O damsel, with what do we know Almighty
Allah?” Said she, “With the understanding.” Said he, “And
what is the understanding?” Quoth she, “It is of two kinds,
natural and acquired.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel
continued, “The understanding is of two kinds, natural and
acquired. The natural is that which Allah (to whom be honour
and glory!) created for the right direction of His servants after
His will; and the acquired is that which men accomplish by dint
of study and fair knowledge.” He rejoined, “Thou hast answered
well. (¿) Where is the seat of the understanding?”—Allah
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>casteth it in the heart whence its lustrous beams ascend to the
brain and there become fixed. (¿) “How knowest thou the
Prophet of Allah?”—By the reading of Allah’s Holy Book and
by signs and proofs and portents and miracles! (¿) “What are
the obligations and the immutable ordinances?”—The obligations
are five, (1) Testification that there is no iláh<a id="r298"></a><a href="#f298" class="c011"><sup>[298]</sup></a> but Allah, no god
but <em>the</em> God alone and One, which for partner hath none, and

standing in prayers.<a id="r299"></a><a href="#f299" class="c011"><sup>[299]</sup></a> (3) The payment of the poor-rate. (4)
Fasting Ramazan. (5) The Pilgrimage to Allah’s Holy House
for all to whom the journey is possible. The immutable ordinances
are four; to wit, night and day and sun and moon, the
which build up life and hope; nor any son of Adam wotteth if
they will be destroyed on the Day of Judgment. (¿) “What are
the obligatory observances of the Faith?”—They are five, prayer,
almsgiving, fasting, pilgrimage, fighting for the Faith and abstinence
from the forbidden. (¿) “Why dost thou stand up to
pray?”—To express the devout intent of the slave acknowledging
the Deity. (¿) “What are the obligatory conditions which precede
standing in prayer?”—Purification, covering the shame,
avoidance of soiled clothes, standing on a clean place, fronting the
Ka’abah, an upright posture, the intent<a id="r300"></a><a href="#f300" class="c011"><sup>[300]</sup></a> and the pronouncing
“Allaho Akbar” of prohibition.<a id="r301"></a><a href="#f301" class="c011"><sup>[301]</sup></a> (¿) “With what shouldest thou
go forth from thy house to pray?”—With the intent of worship
mentally pronounced. (¿) “With what intent shouldest thou
enter the mosque?”—With an intent of service. (¿) “Why do we
front the Kiblah<a id="r302"></a><a href="#f302" class="c011"><sup>[302]</sup></a>?”—In obedience to three Divine orders and one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>Traditional ordinance. (¿) “What are the beginning, the consecration
and the end of prayer?”—Purification beginneth prayer,
saying the Allaho Akbar of prohibition consecrateth, and the
salutation endeth prayer. (¿) “What deserveth he who neglecteth
prayer?”—It is reported, among the authentic Traditions of the
Prophet, that he said, “Whoso neglecteth prayer wilfully and
purposely hath no part in Al-Islam.”——And Shahrazad perceived

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the
damsel had repeated the words of that Holy Tradition the doctor
cried, “Thou hast replied aright: now say me, what is prayer?”—Prayer
is communion between the slave and his lord, and in it
are ten virtues; (1) it illumineth the heart; (2) it maketh the face
shine; (3) it pleaseth the Compassionate One; (4) it angereth
Satan; (5) it conjureth calamity; (6) it wardeth off the mischief
of enemies; (7) it multiplieth mercy; (8) it forfendeth vengeance
and punishment; (9) it bringeth the slave nigh unto his lord; and
(10) it restraineth from lewdness and frowardness. Hence it is
one of the absolute requisites and obligatory ordinances and the
pillar of the Faith. (¿) “What is the key of prayer?”—Wuzú or
the lesser ablution. (¿) “What is the key to the lesser ablution?”—Intention
and naming the Almighty. (¿) “What is the key of
naming the Almighty?”—Assured faith. (¿) “What is the key
of faith?”—Trust in the Lord. (¿) “What is the key of trust in
the Lord?”—Hope. (¿) “What is the key of hope?”—Obedience.
(¿) “What is the key of obedience?”—The confession of the Unity
and the acknowledgment of the divinity of Allah. (¿) “What are
the Divine ordinances of Wuzu, the minor ablution?”<a id="r303"></a><a href="#f303" class="c011"><sup>[303]</sup></a>—They are
six, according to the canon of the Imam al-Sháfi’í Mohammed bin
Idris (of whom Allah accept!); (1) intent while washing the face;
(2) washing the face; (3) washing the hands and fore-arms; (4)
wiping part of the head; (5) washing the feet and heels; and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_197">197</span>(6) observing due order.<a id="r304"></a><a href="#f304" class="c011"><sup>[304]</sup></a> And the traditional statutes are ten,
(1) nomination; (2) and washing the hands before putting them
into the water-pot; (3) and mouth-rinsing; (4) and snuffing;<a id="r305"></a><a href="#f305" class="c011"><sup>[305]</sup></a>
(5) and wiping the whole head; (6) and wetting the ears within
and without with fresh water; (7) and separating a thick beard;
(8) and separating the fingers and toes;<a id="r306"></a><a href="#f306" class="c011"><sup>[306]</sup></a> (9) and washing the right
foot before the left and (10) doing each of these thrice and all in
unbroken order. When the minor ablution is ended, the worshipper
should say, I testify that there is no god but <em>the</em> God, the One, which
for partner hath none, and I testify that Mohammed is His servant
and His apostle. O my Allah, make me of those who repent and
in purity are permanent! Glory to Thee, O my God, and in Thy
praise I bear witness, that there is no god save Thou! I crave
pardon of Thee and I repent to Thee! For it is reported, in the
Holy Traditions, that the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!)
said of this prayer:—Whoso endeth every ablution with
this prayer, the eight gates of Paradise are open to him; he shall
enter at which he pleaseth. (¿) “When a man purposeth ablution,
what betideth him from the angels and the devils?”—When a man
prepareth for ablution, the angels come and stand on his right and
the devils on his left hand.<a id="r307"></a><a href="#f307" class="c011"><sup>[307]</sup></a> If he name Almighty Allah at the
beginning of the ablution, the devils flee from him and the angels
hover over him with a pavilion of light, having four ropes, to each
<span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>an angel glorifying Allah and craving pardon for him, so long as
he remaineth silent or calleth upon the name of Allah. But if he
omit to begin washing with naming Allah (to whom belong might
and majesty!), neither remain silent, the devils take command of
him; and the angels depart from him and Satan whispereth evil
thoughts unto him, till he fall into doubt and come short in his
ablution. For (quoth he on whom be blessing and peace!):—A
perfect ablution driveth away Satan and assureth against the
tyranny of the Sultan; and again quoth he:—If calamity befal
one who is not pure by ablution; verily and assuredly let him
blame none but himself. (¿) “What should a man do when he
awaketh from sleep?”—He should wash his hands thrice, before
putting them into the water vessel. (¿) “What are the Koranic
and traditional orders anent Ghusl, the complete ablution<a id="r308"></a><a href="#f308" class="c011"><sup>[308]</sup></a>?”—The
divine ordinances are intent and ‘crowning’<a id="r309"></a><a href="#f309" class="c011"><sup>[309]</sup></a> the whole body
with water, that is, the liquid shall come at every part of the hair
and skin. Now the traditional ordinances are the minor ablution
as preliminary; rubbing the body; separating the hair and deferring
in words<a id="r310"></a><a href="#f310" class="c011"><sup>[310]</sup></a> the washing of the feet till the end of the

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel had recounted to the doctor what were the divine and traditional
orders anent Ghusl or total ablution, quoth he, “Thou
hast replied aright: now tell me what are the occasions for Tayammum,
or making the ablution with sand and dust; and what are the
ordinances thereof, divine and human?”—The reasons are seven,
viz., want of water; fear lest water lack; need thereto; going astray
on a march; sickness; having broken bones in splints and having
<span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>open wounds.<a id="r311"></a><a href="#f311" class="c011"><sup>[311]</sup></a> As for its ordinances, the divine number four, viz.,
intent, dust, clapping it to the face and clapping it upon the hands;
and the human number two, nomination and preferring the right
before the left hand. (¿) “What are the conditions, the pillars or
essentials, and the traditional statutes of prayer?”—The conditions
are five, (1) purification of the members; (2) covering of the privy
parts; (3) observing the proper hours, either of certainty or to the
best of one’s belief; (4) fronting the Kiblah; and (5) standing on
a clean place. The pillars or essentials number twelve, (1) intent;
(2) the Takbír or magnification of prohibition; (3) standing when
able to stand<a id="r312"></a><a href="#f312" class="c011"><sup>[312]</sup></a>; (4) repeating the Fatihah or opening chapter of
the Koran and saying, In the name of Allah, the Compassionating
the Compassionate! with a verse thereof according to the canon
of the Imam Al-Shafi’i; (5) bowing the body and keeping it
bowed; (6) returning to the upright posture and so remaining
for the time requisite; (7) prostration and permanence therein;
(8) sitting between two prostrations and permanence therein; (9)
repeating the latter profession of the Faith and sitting up therefor;
(10) invoking benediction on the Prophet (whom Allah bless

making an end of prayer expressed in words. But the traditional
statutes are the call to prayer; the standing posture; raising the
hands (to either side of the face) whilst pronouncing the prohibition;
uttering the magnification before reciting the Fatihah;
seeking refuge with Allah<a id="r314"></a><a href="#f314" class="c011"><sup>[314]</sup></a>; saying, ‘Amen’; repeating the chapter
of the Koran after the Fatihah, repeating the magnifications
during change of posture; saying, May Allah hear him who
praiseth Him! and O our Lord, to Thee be the praise!; praying
aloud in the proper place<a id="r315"></a><a href="#f315" class="c011"><sup>[315]</sup></a> and praying under the breath
prayers so prescribed; the first profession of unity and sitting
up thereto; blessing the Prophet therein; blessing his family in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>the latter profession and the second Salutation. (¿) “On what
is the Zakát or obligatory poor-rate taxable?”—On gold and
silver and camels and oxen and sheep and wheat and barley
and holcus and millet and beans and vetches and rice and raisins
and dates. (¿) “What is the Zakát or poor-rate on gold?”—Below
twenty miskals or dinars, nothing; but on that amount
half a dinar for every score and so on proportionally.<a id="r316"></a><a href="#f316" class="c011"><sup>[316]</sup></a> (¿) “On
silver?”—Under two hundred dirhams nothing, then five dirhams
on every two hundred and so forth. (¿) “On camels?”—For every
five, an ewe, or for every twenty-five a pregnant camel. (¿) “On
sheep?”—An ewe for every forty head. (¿) “What are the ordinances
of the Ramazan Fast?”—The Koranic are intent; abstinence
from eating, drinking and carnal copulation, and the stoppage
of vomiting. It is incumbent on all who submit to the Law,
save women in their courses and forty days after childbirth; and
it becomes obligatory on sight of the new moon or on news of its
appearance, brought by a trustworthy person and commending
itself as truth to the hearer’s heart; and among its requisites is
that the intent be pronounced at nightfall. The traditional ordinances
of fasting are, hastening to break the fast at sundown;
deferring the fore dawn meal,<a id="r317"></a><a href="#f317" class="c011"><sup>[317]</sup></a> and abstaining from speech, save
for good works and for calling on the name of Allah and reciting
the Koran. (¿) “What things vitiate not the fast?”—The use of
unguents and eye-powders and the dust of the road and the undesigned
swallowing of saliva and the emission of seed in nocturnal
pollution or at the sight of a strange woman and blooding and
cupping; none of these things vitiates the fast. (¿) “What are
the prayers of the two great annual Festivals?”—Two one-bow
prayers, which be a traditional ordinance, without call to prayer or
standing up to pronounce the call;<a id="r318"></a><a href="#f318" class="c011"><sup>[318]</sup></a> but let the Moslem say, Prayer
is a collector of all folk!<a id="r319"></a><a href="#f319" class="c011"><sup>[319]</sup></a> and pronounce ‘Allaho Akbar’ seven times
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>in the first prayer, besides the Takbir of prohibition; and, in the
second, five times, besides the magnification of rising up (according
to the doctrine of the Imam Al-Shafi’i, on whom Allah have
mercy!) and make the profession of the Faith.——And Shahrazad

the damsel had answered the doctor anent the Festival-prayers,
quoth he, “Thou hast replied aright: now tell me what are the
prayers prescribed on the occasion of an eclipse of the sun or
moon?”—Two one-bow prayers without call to prayer or standing
thereto by the worshipper, who shall make in each two-bow
prayer double standing up and double inclinations and two-fold
prostrations, then sit and testify and salute. (¿) “What is the
ritual of prayer for rain?”—Two one-bow prayers without call to
prayer or standing thereto; then shall the Moslem make the profession

and ask pardon of Allah, in place of the magnification, as
in the two sermons of the Festivals and turn his mantle upper
edge downwards and pray and supplicate. (¿) “What are the
Witr, the additional or occasional prayers?”—The least is a

intent; (2) not leaving the mosque save of necessity; (3)
not having to do with a woman; (4) fasting; and (5) abstaining
from speech. (¿) “Under what conditions is the Hajj or Pilgrimage<a id="r321"></a><a href="#f321" class="c011"><sup>[321]</sup></a>

Moslem and practicability; in which case it is obligatory on
<span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>all, once before death. (¿) “What are the Koranic statutes of
the Pilgrimage?”—(1) The Ihrám or pilgrim’s habit; (2) the
standing at Arafat; (3) circumambulating the Ka’abah; (4)
running between Safá and Marwah<a id="r322"></a><a href="#f322" class="c011"><sup>[322]</sup></a>; and (5) shaving or clipping

War and its essentials?”—Its essentials are (1) the descent of the
Infidels upon us; (2) the presence of the Imam; (3) a state of
preparation and (4) firmness in meeting the foe. Its traditional
ordinance is incital to battle, in that the Most High hath said,
“O thou my Prophet, incite the faithful to fight!”<a id="r328"></a><a href="#f328" class="c011"><sup>[328]</sup></a> (¿) “What
are the ordinances of buying and selling?”—The Koranic are
(1) offer and acceptance and (2) if the thing sold be a white
slave, by whom one profiteth, all possible endeavour to convert
him to Al-Islam; and (3) to abstain from usury: the traditional

to his saying (whom Allah bless and preserve!), “The parties
to a sale shall have the option of cancelling or altering terms
whilst they are yet unseparated.” (¿) “What is it forbidden to
sell for what?”—On this point I mind me of an authentic
tradition, reported by Náf’i<a id="r330"></a><a href="#f330" class="c011"><sup>[330]</sup></a> of the Apostle of Allah, that he
forbade the barter of dried dates for fresh and fresh figs for dry

all eatables of one and the same kind, it is unlawful to buy or
barter some for other some.<a id="r331"></a><a href="#f331" class="c011"><sup>[331]</sup></a> Now when the doctor of law heard

the assembly of the Commander of the Faithful.” So he said
to her, “O damsel, what is the lexicographical meaning of
Wuzú?” And she answered, “Philologically it signifieth cleanliness
and freedom from impurities.” (¿) “And of Salát or prayer?”—An
invocation of good. (¿) “And of Ghusl?”—Purification.
(¿) “And of Saum or fasting?”—Abstention. (¿) “And
of Zakát?”—Increase. (¿) “And of Hajj or pilgrimage?”—Visitation.

doctor’s arguments were cut off, he rose to his feet and said, “Bear
witness against me, O Commander of the Faithful, that this
damsel is more learned in the Law than I am.” Quoth she,
“I will ask thee somewhat, which do thou answer me speedily,
an thou be indeed a learned man.” Quoth he, “Say on;” and
she said, “What are the arrows of the Faith?” Answered he,
“They number ten, (1) Testification, that is, religion; (2) Prayer,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>that is, the covenant; (3) Alms, that is, purification; (4) Fasting,
that is, defensive armour; (5) Pilgrimage, that is, the Law; (6)
Fighting for the Faith, that is, a general duty; (7) Bidding to
beneficence and (8) Forbidding from frowardness, both of which
are a man’s honour; (9) Commune,<a id="r332"></a><a href="#f332" class="c011"><sup>[332]</sup></a> that is, sociableness of the
Faithful; and (10) Seeking knowledge, that is, the praiseworthy
path.” She rejoined, “Thou hast replied aright and now
remaineth but one question, What be the roots or fundamentals of
Al-Islam?” He said, “They are four, sincerity of belief, truth of
intent, observance of the lawful limit and keeping the covenant.”
Then said she, “I have one more question to ask thee, which if
thou answer, it is well; else, I will take thy clothes.” Quoth he,
“Speak, O damsel;” and she said, “What are the branches or
superstructure of Al-Islam?” But he was silent awhile and made
no reply: so she cried, “Doff thy clothes and I will expound them
to thee.” Quoth the Caliph “Expound them, and I will make
him put off his clothes for thee.” She said, “There are two-and-twenty
branches; (1) holding fast to the Book of Allah the Most
Highest; (2) taking example by His Apostle (whom Allah bless
and preserve!); (3) abstaining from evil doing; (4) eating what is
lawful and (5) avoiding what is unlawful; (6) restitution of things
wrongfully taken; (7) repentance; (8) knowledge of the Law; (9)
love of the Friend,<a id="r333"></a><a href="#f333" class="c011"><sup>[333]</sup></a> (10) and of the followers of the true Revelation;
(11) belief in the apostles of Al-Islam; (12) fear of apostacy;

(15) mercy on all possible occasions; (16) strength in time of
weakness; (17) patience under trials; (18) knowledge of Allah

the lusts of the soul and warring them down, and (22) devotion to

her words, he bade the professor put off his clothes and hooded
turband; and so did that doctor and went forth, beaten and confounded,
from the Caliph’s presence. Thereupon another man
stood up and said to her, “O damsel, hear a few questions from
me.” Quoth she, “Say on;” and he asked, “What are the conditions
of purchase by advance?” whereto she answered, “That
the price be fixed, the kind be fixed and the period of delivery be
fixed and known.” (¿) “What are the Koranic and the traditional
canons of eating?”—The confession that Allah Almighty provideth
the eater and giveth him meat and drink, with thanksgiving
to Him therefor. (¿) “What is thanksgiving?”—The use by the
creature of that which the Creator vouchsafeth to him, according
as it was created for the creature. (¿) “What are the traditional
canons of eating?”—The Bismillah<a id="r334"></a><a href="#f334" class="c011"><sup>[334]</sup></a> and washing both hands;
sitting on the left of the hind part; eating with three fingers, and
eating of that which hath been duly masticated.<a id="r335"></a><a href="#f335" class="c011"><sup>[335]</sup></a> (¿) “What are

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel had answered concerning good manners in eating, the
doctor who was trying her, rejoined, “Thou hast replied aright.
Now tell me what are the stays of the heart and their supports?”<a id="r336"></a><a href="#f336" class="c011"><sup>[336]</sup></a>—The
stays and supports both number three; (1) holding fast to
the Faith, the support whereof is the shunning of infidelity; (2)
holding fast to the Traditional Law, and its support the shunning
of innovation; and (3) holding fast to obedience, and its support
the shunning of disobedience. (¿) “What are the conditions of
Wuzu?”—(1) being a Moslem; (2) discernment of good and evil;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>(3) purity of the water, and (4) absence of material or religious
impediments. (¿) “What is belief?”—It is divided into nine
parts, (1) belief in the One worshipped; (2) belief in the condition
of slavery of the worshipper; (3) belief in the personality of the
Deity; (4) belief in the Two Handfuls;<a id="r337"></a><a href="#f337" class="c011"><sup>[337]</sup></a> (5) belief in Providence
which allotteth to man his lot; (6) belief in the Abrogating and
(7) in the Abrogated; (8) belief in Allah, His angels and apostles;
and (9) in fore-ordained Fate, general and individual, its good and
ill, its sweet and bitter. (¿) “What three things do away other
three?”—It is told of Sufyán al-Saurí<a id="r338"></a><a href="#f338" class="c011"><sup>[338]</sup></a> that he said, “Three things
do away with other three. Making light of the pious doth away
the future life, making light of Kings doth away this life, and,
making light of expenditure doth away wealth.” (¿) “What are
the keys of the heavens, and how many gates have they?”—Quoth
Almighty Allah, “And the heaven shall be opened and
be full of portals;”<a id="r339"></a><a href="#f339" class="c011"><sup>[339]</sup></a> and quoth he whom Allah bless and preserve!,
“None knoweth the number of the gates of heavens, save
He who created the heavens, and there is no son of Adam but
hath two gates allotted to him in the heavens, one whereby his
daily bread descendeth and another wherethrough his works
ascend. The first gate is not closed, save when his term of life
cometh to an end, nor the gate of works, good and evil, till his
soul ascend for judgment.” (¿) “Tell me of a thing and a half
thing and a no-thing.”—The thing is the Moslem; the half thing
the hypocrite,<a id="r340"></a><a href="#f340" class="c011"><sup>[340]</sup></a> and the no-thing the miscreant. (¿) “Tell me of
various kinds of hearts.”—There is the whole heart, the sick heart,
the contrite heart, the vowed heart and the enlightened heart.
Now the whole heart is that of Abraham, the Friend of Allah;
the sick heart is that of the Unbeliever in Al-Islam; the contrite
heart is that of the pious who fear the Lord; the vowed heart is
that of our Lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!) and
the illuminated heart is that of his followers. Furthermore, the
hearts of learned Olema are of three kinds, the heart which is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>in love with this world; the heart which loveth the next world,
and the heart which loveth its Lord; and it is said that hearts
are three, the suspended, that of the infidel; the non-existent,
that of the hypocrite; and the constant, that of the True-believer.
Moreover, it is said that the firm heart is of three kinds, viz., the
heart dilated with light and faith, the heart wounded with fear of
estrangement and the heart which feareth to be forsaken of its
Supreme Friend.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
second doctor declared, “Thou hast said well,” quoth she to the
Caliph, “O Commander of the Faithful, he hath questioned me,
till he is weary, and now I will ask of him two questions. If
he answer them both, it is well; and if not, I will take his clothes
and he shall wend in peace.” Quoth the doctor, “Ask me what
thou wilt,” and she said, “What sayest thou religion is?” Answered
he, “Religion is confession of Faith with the tongue and
conviction with the heart and correspondent action with the
members. He (upon whom be blessings and peace!) hath said:—The
believer is not perfect in belief, except he perfect himself in
five qualities, namely, trust in Allah,<a id="r341"></a><a href="#f341" class="c011"><sup>[341]</sup></a> committal of his affair to
Allah, submission to the commands of Allah, acquiescence in the
decrees of Allah; and that all he doth be done for sake of Allah;
so is he of those who are acceptable to the Deity, and who give
to Him and withhold for Him; and such man is perfect in belief.”
Then said she, “What is the Divine ordinance of ordinances and
the ordinance which is the initiator of all ordinances and that of
which all others stand in need and that which comprehendeth all
others; and what is the traditional ordinance that entereth into
the Koranic, and the prophetic practice whereby the Divine is
completed?” But he was silent and made no reply; whereupon
the Caliph bade her expound and ordered him to doff his clothes
and give them to her. Said she, “O doctor, the Koranic ordinance
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>of ordinances is the knowledge of Almighty Allah; that,
which is the initiative of all others, is the testifying there is no
god but <em>the</em> God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God; that, of

Therewith was made manifest the defeat of the doctor, who rose
to his feet and said, “I call Allah to witness, O Commander of
the Faithful, that this damsel is more learned than I in theology
and what pertaineth to the Law.” So saying, he put off his
clothes and went away ignominiously worsted. Then she turned
to the rest of the learned men present and said, “O masters,
which of you is the Koranist, the reader and reciter of the
Koran, versed in the seven readings and in syntax and in lexicography?”
Thereupon a professor arose and, seating himself
before her, said, “Hast thou read the Book of Almighty Allah
and made thyself thoroughly acquainted with its signs, that is its
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>verses, and its abrogating parts and abrogated portions, its unequivocal
commands and its ambiguous; and the difference of its
revelations, Meccan and Medinan? Dost thou understand its
interpretation and hast thou studied it, according to the various
traditions and origins?” “Yes,” answered she; and he said,
“What then is the number of its chapters, how many are the
decades and versets, how many words and how many letters and
how many acts of prostration and how many prophets and how
many chapters are Medinan and how many are Meccan and how
many birds are mentioned in it?” Replied she, “O my lord, its
chapters are an hundred and fourteen, whereof seventy were
revealed at Meccah and forty-four at Al-Medinah; and it containeth
six hundred and twenty-one decades; six thousand three
hundred and thirty-six versets;<a id="r345"></a><a href="#f345" class="c011"><sup>[345]</sup></a> seventy-nine thousand four hundred

best is that whereof the Sublime Koran speaketh and the Traditions
perpetuate. And he (whom Allah bless and keep!) was used
to ejaculate, “I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned.”
And quoth a Tradition, reported by Naf’i on the authority of his
adopted father, “The apostle of Allah, was wont when he rose in

with all Majesty! Praise be to Allah abundantly! Glory to Allah
morn and even be!” Then would he say, “I seek refuge with
Allah from Satan the Stoned and from the delusions of the Devils
and their evil suggestions.” And it is told of Ibn Abbas<a id="r364"></a><a href="#f364" class="c011"><sup>[364]</sup></a> (of
whom Allah accept!) that he said, “The first time Gabriel came
down to the Prophet with revelation he taught him the ‘seeking

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel had told the professor concerning the difference of opinion
among the learned touching the ‘Basmalah,’ he said, “Thou hast
replied aright: now tell me why is not the formula written at the
head of the chapter of Immunity<a id="r367"></a><a href="#f367" class="c011"><sup>[367]</sup></a>?”; and she answered, “When
this chapter was revealed from on high for the dissolution of the
alliance between the Prophet and the idolaters, He (whom Allah
bless and preserve!) sent Ali<a id="r368"></a><a href="#f368" class="c011"><sup>[368]</sup></a> ibn Abí Tálib (whose face Allah
honour!) therewith, and he read the chapter to them, but did not
read the Basmalah.”<a id="r369"></a><a href="#f369" class="c011"><sup>[369]</sup></a> (¿) “What of the excellence of the formula
and its blessing?”—It is told of the Prophet that he said, “Never is
the Basmalah pronounced over aught, but there is a blessing in it;”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_213">213</span>and it is reported, on authority of Him (whom Allah bless and
preserve!) that the Lord of Glory swore by His glory that never
should the Basmalah be pronounced over a sick person, but he
should be healed of his sickness. Moreover, it is said that, when
Allah created the empyrean, it was agitated with an exceeding
agitation; but He wrote on it, ‘Bismillah’ and its agitation subsided.
When the formula first descended from heaven to the
Prophet, he said, “I am safe from three things, earthquake and
metamorphosis and drowning;” and indeed its boons are great
and its blessings too many to enumerate. It is told of Allah’s
Apostle that he said, “There will be brought on the Judgment-day
a man with whom He shall reckon and finding no good deed to
his account, shall order him to the Fire; but the man will cry:—O
my God, Thou hast not dealt justly by me! Then shall Allah
(to whom be honour and glory!) say, How so? and the man shall
answer, O Lord, for that Thou callest Thyself the Compassionating,
the Compassionate, yet wilt Thou punish me with the Fire!
And Allah (magnified be His Majesty!) shall reply, I did indeed
name myself the Compassionating, the Compassionate. Carry My
servant to Paradise, of My mercy, for I am the most Merciful of
the mercifuls!” (¿) “What was the origin of the use of the
Basmalah?”—When Allah sent down from Heaven the Koran,
they wrote, “In Thy name, O my God!”; when Allah revealed the
words, “Say: Call upon Allah, or call upon the Compassionating, what
days ye pray, for hath He the most excellent names,”<a id="r370"></a><a href="#f370" class="c011"><sup>[370]</sup></a> they wrote,
“In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate;”
and, when He revealed the words, “Your God is one God, there is
no God but He, the Compassionating, the Compassionate,”<a id="r371"></a><a href="#f371" class="c011"><sup>[371]</sup></a> they
wrote, “In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!”
Now when the Koranist heard her reply, he hung down
his head and said to himself, “This be a marvel of marvels! How
hath this slave-girl expounded the origin of the Basmalah? But,
by Allah, needs must I go about with her and haply defeat her.”
So he asked, “Did Allah reveal the Koran all at once or at times
<span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>manifold?” She answered, “Gabriel the Faithful (on whom be
peace!) descended with it from the Lord of the Worlds upon His
Prophet Mohammed, Prince of the Apostles and Seal of the
Prophets, by detached versets; bidding and forbidding, covenanting
and comminating, and containing advices and instances in the
course of twenty years as occasion called for it.” (¿) “Which
chapter was first revealed?”—According to Ibn Abbas, that entituled
Congealed Blood:<a id="r372"></a><a href="#f372" class="c011"><sup>[372]</sup></a> and, according to Jábir bin Abdillah,<a id="r373"></a><a href="#f373" class="c011"><sup>[373]</sup></a>
that called ‘The Covered’ which preceded all others.<a id="r374"></a><a href="#f374" class="c011"><sup>[374]</sup></a> (¿) “Which
verset was the last revealed?”—That of Usury,<a id="r375"></a><a href="#f375" class="c011"><sup>[375]</sup></a> and it is also said,
the verse, “When there cometh Allah’s succour and victory.”<a id="r376"></a><a href="#f376" class="c011"><sup>[376]</sup></a>——And

the damsel told the Koranist which was the last verse he said,
“Thou hast replied aright; now tell me the names of the Companions

Thou knowest what is in my soul, and I know not what is in Thy
soul”?<a id="r379"></a><a href="#f379" class="c011"><sup>[379]</sup></a>—They mean, “Thou knowest the truth of me and what is

His words,<a id="r380"></a><a href="#f380" class="c011"><sup>[380]</sup></a> ‘Thou art He who wottest the hidden things’”; and it
is said, also, “Thou knowest my essence, but I know not Thine

‘O true believers, forbid not yourselves the good things which Allah

masculine and don sackcloth;” whereupon this verse was revealed.
But Al-Kutádah declareth that it was revealed on account of
sundry Companions of the Apostle of Allah, namely, Ali ibn Abí
Tálib and Othmán bin Musa’ab and others, who said, “We will
geld ourselves and don hair cloth and make us monks.” (¿)
“What sayest thou of the words of the Most Highest, ‘And Allah
took Abraham for His friend’”?<a id="r382"></a><a href="#f382" class="c011"><sup>[382]</sup></a>—The friend of Allah is the needy,
the poor, and (according to another saying) he is the lover, he who
is detached from the world in the love of Allah Almighty and
in whose attachment there is no falling away. Now when the
Koranist<a id="r383"></a><a href="#f383" class="c011"><sup>[383]</sup></a> saw her pass on in speech with the passage of the clouds
and that she stayed not in reply, he rose to his feet and said, “I take
Allah to witness, O Commander of the Faithful, that this damsel
is more learned than I in Koranic exegesis and what pertaineth
thereto.” Then said she, “I will ask thee one question, which if
thou answer it is well; but if thou answer not, I will strip off thy
clothes.” Quoth the Commander of the Faithful, “Ask on,” and
she enquired, “Which verset of the Koran hath in it three-and-twenty
Káfs, which sixteen Míms, which an hundred and forty

reply, and she said to him, “Put off thy clothes.” So he doffed
them, and she continued, “O Commander of the Faithful, the

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel defeated the Koranist and took off his clothes and sent
him away confused, then came forward the skilled physician and
said to her, “We are free of theology and come now to physiology.
Tell me, therefore, how is man made; how many veins, bones and
vertebræ are there in his body; which is the first and chief vein
and why Adam was named Adam?” She replied, “Adam was
called Adam, because of his <em>udmah</em>, that is, the wheaten colour of
his complexion and also (it is said) because he was created of the
<em>adim</em> of the earth, that is to say, of the surface-soil. His breast
was made of the earth of the Ka’abah, his head of earth from the
East and his legs of earth from the West. There were created for
him seven doors in his head, viz., the eyes, the ears, the nostrils
and the mouth, and two passages, before and behind. The eyes
were made the seat of the sight-sense, the ears the seat of the
hearing-sense, the nostrils the seat of the smell-sense, the mouth
the seat of the taste-sense and the tongue to utter what is in the
heart of man.<a id="r393"></a><a href="#f393" class="c011"><sup>[393]</sup></a> Now Adam was made of a compound of the four
elements, which be water, earth, fire and air. The yellow bile is
the humour of fire, being hot-dry; the black bile that of earth,
being cold-dry; the phlegm that of water, being cold-moist, and
the blood that of air, being hot-moist.<a id="r394"></a><a href="#f394" class="c011"><sup>[394]</sup></a> There were made in man
three hundred and sixty veins, two hundred and forty-nine bones,
and three souls<a id="r395"></a><a href="#f395" class="c011"><sup>[395]</sup></a> or spirits, the animal, the rational and the natural,
to each of which is allotted its proper function. Moreover, Allah
made him a heart and spleen and lungs and six intestines and a
liver and two kidneys and buttocks and brain and bones and skin
and five senses; hearing, seeing, smell, taste, touch. The heart
He set on the left side of the breast and made the stomach the
guide and governor thereof. He appointed the lungs for a fan
to the heart and stablished the liver on the right side, opposite
thereto. Moreover, He made, besides this, the diaphragm and
the viscera and set up the bones of the breast and latticed them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_218">218</span>with the ribs.” (¿) “How many ventricles are there in a man’s
head?”—Three, which contain five faculties, styled the intrinsic
senses, to wit, common sense, imagination, the thinking faculty,
perception and memory. (¿) “Describe to me the configuration
of the bones.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
physicist said to her, “Describe to me the configuration of the
bones,” she replied, “Man’s frame consists of two hundred and forty
bones, which are divided into three parts, the head, the trunk and
the extremities. The head is divided into calvarium and face. The
skull is constructed of eight bones, and to it are attached the four
osselets of the ear. The face is furnished with an upper jaw of
eleven bones and a lower jaw of one; and to these are added the
teeth two-and-thirty in number, and the os hyoides.<a id="r396"></a><a href="#f396" class="c011"><sup>[396]</sup></a> The trunk is
divided into spinal column, breast and basin. The spinal column is
made up of four-and-twenty bones, called Fikár or vertebræ; the
breast, of the breast-bone and the ribs, which are four-and-twenty in
number, twelve on each side; and the basin of the hips, the sacrum<a id="r397"></a><a href="#f397" class="c011"><sup>[397]</sup></a>
and the os coccygis. The extremities are divided into upper and
lower, arms and legs. The arms are again divided firstly into
shoulder, comprising shoulder blades and collar bone; secondly
into the upper arm which is one bone; thirdly into fore-arm, composed
of two bones, the radius and the ulna, and fourthly into the
hand, consisting of the wrist, the metacarpus of five and the fingers,
which number five, of three bones each, called the phalanges,
except the thumb, which hath but two. The lower extremities
are divided, firstly into thigh, which is one bone secondly into
leg, composed of three bones, the tibia, the fibula and the patella,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span>and thirdly into the foot, divided, like the hand, into tarsus,
metatarsus and toes; and is composed of seven bones, ranged
in two rows, two in one and five in the other; and the metatarsus
is composed of five bones and the toes number five, each
of three phalanges except the big toe which hath only two.”
(¿) “Which is the root of the veins?”—The aorta, from which
they ramify, and they are many, none knoweth the tale of them
save He who created them; but I repeat, it is said that they
number three hundred and sixty.<a id="r398"></a><a href="#f398" class="c011"><sup>[398]</sup></a> Moreover, Allah hath appointed
the tongue as interpreter for the thought, the eyes to serve as
lanterns, the nostrils to smell with, and the hands for prehensors.
The liver is the seat of pity, the spleen of laughter<a id="r399"></a><a href="#f399" class="c011"><sup>[399]</sup></a> and the
kidneys of craft; the lungs are ventilators, the stomach the store-house
and the heart the prop and pillar of the body. When the
heart is sound, the whole body is sound, and when the heart is
corrupt, the whole body is corrupt. (¿) “What are the outward
signs and symptoms evidencing disease in the members of the
body, both external and internal?”—A physician, who is a man of
understanding, looketh into the state of the body and is guided by
the feel of the hands,<a id="r400"></a><a href="#f400" class="c011"><sup>[400]</sup></a> according as they are firm or flabby, hot or
cool, moist or dry. Internal disorders are also indicated by external
symptoms, such as yellowness of the white of the eyes, which
denoteth jaundice, and bending of the back, which denoteth disease
of the lungs.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel had described to the doctor the outer signs and symptoms
quoth he, “Thou hast replied aright! now what are the internal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>symptoms of disease?”—The science of the diagnosis of disease by
internal symptoms is founded upon six canons, (1) the patient’s
actions; (2) what is evacuated from his body; (3) the nature of
the pain and (4) the site thereof; (5) swelling and (6) the effluvia
given off his person. (¿) “How cometh hurt to the head?”—By
the ingestion of food upon food, before the first be digested, and
by fullness upon fullness; this it is that wasteth peoples. He who
would live long, let him be early with the morning-meal and not
late with the evening-meal; let him be sparing of commerce with
women and chary of such depletory measures as cupping and
blood-letting; and let him make of his belly three parts, one for
food, one for drink and the third for air; for that a man’s intestines
are eighteen spans in length and it befitteth that he appoint six
for meat, six for drink, and six for breath. If he walk, let him go
gently; it will be wholesomer for him and better for his body and
more in accordance with the saying of the Almighty, “Walk not
proudly on the earth.”<a id="r401"></a><a href="#f401" class="c011"><sup>[401]</sup></a> (¿) “What are the symptoms of yellow
bile and what is to be feared therefrom?”—The symptoms are
sallow complexion and bitter taste in the mouth with dryness;
failure of the appetite, venereal and other, and rapid pulse; and the
patient hath to fear high fever and delirium and eruptions and
jaundice and tumour and ulcers of the bowels and excessive thirst.
(¿) “What are the symptoms of black bile and what hath the
patient to fear from it, an it get the mastery of the body?”—The
symptoms are false appetite and great mental disquiet and cark
and care; and it behoveth that it be evacuated, else it will generate
melancholia<a id="r402"></a><a href="#f402" class="c011"><sup>[402]</sup></a> and leprosy and cancer and disease of the spleen and
ulceration of the bowels. (¿) “Into how many branches is the art
of medicine divided?”—Into two: the art of diagnosing diseases
and that of restoring the diseased body to health. (¿) “When
is the drinking of medicine more efficacious than other-when?”—When
the sap runs in the wood and the grape thickens in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>cluster and the two auspicious planets, Jupiter and Venus, are in
the ascendant; then setteth in the proper season for drinking of
drugs and doing away of disease. (¿) “What time is it, when, if a
man drink water from a new vessel, the drink is sweeter and lighter
or more digestible to him than at another time, and there ascendeth
to him a pleasant fragrance and a penetrating?”——When he
waiteth awhile after eating, as quoth the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">

      <div class="line">Drink not upon thy food in haste but wait awhile; ✿ Else thou with halter shalt thy frame to sickness lead:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(¿) “What food is it that giveth not rise to ailments?”—That which
is not eaten but after hunger, and when it is eaten, the ribs are not
filled with it, even as saith Jálínús or Galen the physician, “Whoso
will take in food, let him go slowly and he shall not go wrongly.”
And to conclude with His saying (on whom be blessing and
peace!), “The stomach is the house of disease, and diet is the
head of healing; for the origin of all sickness is indigestion, that
is to say, corruption of the meat”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the damsel said to the doctor, “The stomach is the house of
disease and diet is the head of healing; for the origin of all sickness
is indigestion, that is to say, corruption of the meat in the
stomach;” he rejoined, “Thou hast replied aright! what sayest
thou of the Hammam?”—Let not the full man enter it. Quoth
the Prophet, “The bath is the blessing of the house, for that it
cleanseth the body and calleth to mind the Fire.” (¿) “What
Hammams are best for bathing in?”—Those whose waters are
sweet and whose space is ample and which are kept well aired;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>their atmosphere representing the four seasons—autumn and summer
and winter and spring. (¿) “What kind of food is the most
profitable?”—That which women make and which hath not cost
overmuch trouble and which is readily digested. The most
excellent of food is brewis<a id="r404"></a><a href="#f404" class="c011"><sup>[404]</sup></a> or bread sopped in broth; according
to the saying of the Prophet, “Brewis excelleth other food, even
as Ayishah excelleth other women.” (¿) “What kind of kitchen,
or seasoning, is most profitable?”—“Flesh meat” (quoth the
Prophet) “is the most excellent of kitchen; for that it is the
delight of this world and the next world.” (¿) “What kind of
meat is the most profitable?”—Mutton; but jerked meat is to be
avoided, for there is no profit in it. (¿) “What of fruits?”—Eat
them in their prime and quit them when their season is past.
(¿) “What sayest thou of drinking water?”—Drink it not in large
quantities nor swallow it by gulps, or it will give thee head-ache
and cause divers kinds of harm; neither drink it immediately after
leaving the Hammam nor after carnal copulation or eating (except
it be after the lapse of fifteen minutes for a young man and forty
for an old man), nor after waking from sleep. (¿) “What of drinking
fermented liquors?”—Doth not the prohibition suffice thee in
the Book of Almighty Allah, where He saith, “Verily, wine and
lots and images, and the divining arrows are an abomination, of
Satan’s work; therefore avoid them, that ye may prosper”?<a id="r405"></a><a href="#f405" class="c011"><sup>[405]</sup></a> And
again, “They will ask thee concerning wine and lots: Answer, ‘In
both there is great sin and also some things of use unto men:
but their sinfulness is greater than their use.’”<a id="r406"></a><a href="#f406" class="c011"><sup>[406]</sup></a> Hence quoth the
poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>O bibber of liquor, art not ashamed ✿ To drink what Allah forbade thee drain?</div>
      <div class="line">Put it far from thee and approach it not; ✿ It holds what Allah forbade as bane.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And quoth another to the same purport:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I drank the sin till my reason fled: ✿ I’ll drink that reason to loss misled!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">As for the advantages that be therein, it disperseth stone and
gravel from the kidneys and strengtheneth the viscera and
banisheth care, and moveth to generosity and preserveth health
and digestion; it conserveth the body, expelleth disease from the
joints, purifieth the frame of corrupt humours, engendereth cheerfulness,
gladdeneth the heart of man and keepeth up the natural
heat: it contracteth the bladder, enforceth the liver and removeth
obstructions, reddeneth the cheeks, cleareth away maggots from
the brain and deferreth grey hairs. In short, had not Allah (to
whom be honour and glory!) forbidden it,<a id="r407"></a><a href="#f407" class="c011"><sup>[407]</sup></a> there were not on the
face of the earth aught fit to stand in its stead. As for gambling
by lots, it is a game of hazard such as dicing not of skill.
(¿) “What wine is best?”—That which is pressed from white
grapes and kept eighty days or more after fermentation: it
resembleth not water and indeed there is nothing on the surface
of the earth like unto it. (¿) “What sayest thou of cupping?”—It
is for him who is over full of blood and who hath no defect
therein; and whoso would be cupped, let it be during the wane of
the moon, on a day without cloud, wind or rain and on the
seventeenth of the month. If it fall on a Tuesday, it will be the
more efficacious, and nothing is more salutary for the brain and
eyes and for clearing the intellect than cupping.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Fifty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel enumerated the benefits of cupping, quoth the doctor,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span>“What is the best time for cupping?”—One should be cupped ‘on
the spittle,’ that is, in the morning before eating, for this fortifieth
the wit and the memory. It is reported of the Prophet that, when
anyone complained to him of a pain in the head or legs, he would
bid him be cupped and after cupping not eat salt food fasting,
for it engendereth scurvy; neither eat sour things as curded milk<a id="r408"></a><a href="#f408" class="c011"><sup>[408]</sup></a>
immediately after cupping. (¿) “When is cupping to be avoided?”—On
Sabbaths or Saturdays and Wednesdays, and let him who is
cupped on these days blame none but himself. Moreover, one
should not be cupped in very hot weather nor in very cold
weather; and the best season for cupping is springtide. Quoth
the doctor, “Now tell me of carnal copulation.” Hereupon
Tawaddud hung her head, for shame and confusion before the
Caliph’s majesty; then said, “By Allah, O Commander of the
Faithful, it is not that I am at fault, but that I am ashamed;
though, indeed, the answer is on the edge of my tongue.” Said
the Caliph; “Speak, O damsel,” whereupon said she, “Copulation
hath in it many and exceeding virtues and praiseworthy qualities,
amongst which are, that it lighteneth a body full of black bile and
calmeth the heat of love and induceth affection and dilateth the
heart and dispelleth the sadness of solitude; and the excess of
it is more harmful in summer and autumn than in spring and
winter.” (¿) “What are its good effects?”—It banisheth trouble
and disquiet, calmeth love and wrath and is good for ulcers,
especially in a cold and dry humour; on the other hand excess
of it weakeneth the sight and engendereth pains in the legs and
head and back: and beware, beware of carnal connection with old
women, for they are deadly. Quoth the Imam Ali<a id="r409"></a><a href="#f409" class="c011"><sup>[409]</sup></a> (whose face
Allah honour!), “Four things kill and ruin the body: entering the
Hammam on a full stomach; eating salt food; copulation on a
plethora of blood and lying with an ailing woman; for she will
weaken thy strength and infect thy frame with sickness; and an
old woman is deadly poison.” And quoth one of them, “Beware
of taking an old woman to wife, though she be richer in hoards
than Kárún.”<a id="r410"></a><a href="#f410" class="c011"><sup>[410]</sup></a> (¿) “What is the best copulation?”—If the woman
<span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>be tender of years, comely of shape, fair of face, swelling of breast
and of noble race, she will add to thee strength and health of body;
and let her be even as saith a certain poet describing her:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(¿) “At what time is copulation good?”—If by night, after food
digested and if by day, after the morning meal. (¿) “What are
the most excellent fruits?”—Pomegranate and citron. (¿) “Which
is the most excellent of vegetables?”—Endive.<a id="r411"></a><a href="#f411" class="c011"><sup>[411]</sup></a> (¿) “Which of
sweet-scented flowers?”—Rose and Violet. (¿) “How is the
seed of man secreted?”—There is in man a vein which feedeth
all the other veins. Now water is collected from the three hundred
and sixty veins and, in the form of red blood, entereth the left
testicle, where it is decocted, by the heat of temperament inherent
in the son of Adam, into a thick, white liquid, whose odour is as
that of the palm-spathe. (¿) “What flying thing is it that emitteth
seed and menstruateth?”—The flitter-mouse,<a id="r412"></a><a href="#f412" class="c011"><sup>[412]</sup></a> that is the bat.
(¿) “What is that which, when confined and shut out from the

“What is that thing which resembleth the earth in roundness, whose
resting-place and whose spine are hidden from men’s eyes; little
of price and estimation; narrow of chest and shackled as to throat
though it be nor runaway slave nor pestilent thief; thrust through

time eateth its vigour and water wasteth it away; now it is beaten
without blemish, and then made to serve without stint; united
after separation; submissive, but not to him who caresseth it;
pregnant without child in belly; drooping, yet not leaning on its
side; becoming dirty yet purifying itself; cleaving to its fere,
yet changing; copulating without a yard, wrestling without arms:
resting and taking its ease; bitten, yet not crying out: now more
complaisant than a cup-companion and then more troublesome
than summer-heat; leaving its mate by night and embracing her
by day and having its abode in the corners of the mansions of the
noble?” The physician was silent awhile in perplexity and his
colour changed and he bowed his head and made no reply; whereupon
she said to him, “Ho, sir doctor, speak or doff thy dress.”
At this, he rose and said, “O Commander of the Faithful, bear
witness against me that this damsel is more learned than I in
medicine and what else, and that I cannot cope with her.” And
he put off his clothes and fled forth. Quoth the Caliph to Tawaddud,
“Ree us thy riddle,” and she replied, “O Commander of
the Faithful, it is the button and the button-loop.<a id="r414"></a><a href="#f414" class="c011"><sup>[414]</sup></a>”—Then she
undertook the astronomers and said, “Let him of you who is an

said, “Art thou the astronomer, the mathematician, the scribe?”

from the shadows in the Eastern hemisphere and setteth in the
shadows of the Western, and each hemisphere compriseth one
hundred and eighty degrees. Quoth Allah Almighty, ‘I swear by
the Lord of the East and of the West.’<a id="r415"></a><a href="#f415" class="c011"><sup>[415]</sup></a> And again, ‘He it is

me of the planets and their natures, also of their sojourn in the
Zodiacal Signs, their aspects, auspicious and sinister, their houses,
ascendants and descendants.” She answered, “The sitting is
narrow for so large a matter, but I will say as much as I can.
Now the planets number seven; which are, the Sun, the Moon,
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn. The Sun, hot-dry, sinister
in conjunction, favourable in opposition, abideth thirty days in
each Sign. The Moon, cold-moist and favourable of aspect,
tarrieth in each Sign two days and a third of another day.
Mercury is of a mixed nature, favourable in conjunction with
the favourable, and sinister in conjunction with the sinister
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>aspects, and abideth in each sign seventeen days and a half
day. Venus, temperate and favourable, abideth in each sign
five-and-twenty days. Mars is sinister and woneth in each sign
ten months. Jupiter is auspicious and abideth in each sign a
year. Saturn, cold-dry and sinister, tarrieth in each sign thirty
months. The house of the Sun is Leo, her ascendant is Aries,
and her descendant Aquarius. The Moon’s house is Cancer,
his ascendant Taurus, his descendant Scorpio and his sinister
aspect Capricorn. Saturn’s house is Capricorn-Aquarius, his
ascendant Libra, his descendant Aries and his sinister aspects
Cancer and Leo. Jupiter’s house is Pisces-Sagittarius, his ascendant
Cancer, his descendant Capricorn and his sinister aspects
Gemini and Leo. Venus’s house is Taurus, her ascendant Pisces,
her descendant Libra, and her sinister aspects Aries and Scorpio.
Mercury’s house is Gemini-Virgo, his ascendant Virgo, his
descendant Pisces, and his sinister aspect Taurus. Mars’s house
is Aries-Scorpio, his ascendant Capricorn, his descendant
Cancer and his sinister aspect Libra.” Now when the astronomer
saw her acuteness and comprehensive learning and heard
her fair answers, he bethought him for a sleight to confound her
before the Commander of the Faithful, and said to her, “O
damsel, tell me, will rain fall this month?” At this she bowed her
head and pondered so long, that the Caliph thought her at a loss
for an answer and the astronomer said to her, “Why dost thou
not speak?” Quoth she, “I will not speak except the Commander
of the Faithful give me leave.” So the Caliph laughed and said,
“How so?” Cried she, “I would have thee give me a sword, that
I may strike off his head, for he is an Infidel, an Agnostic, an
Atheist.<a id="r421"></a><a href="#f421" class="c011"><sup>[421]</sup></a>” At this, loud laughed the Caliph and those about him
laughed, and she continued, “O astronomer, there are five things
that none knoweth save Allah Almighty;” and she repeated the
verset; ‘Aye! Allah!—with Him is the knowledge of the hour
and He causeth the rain to descend at His own appointed time—and
He knoweth what is in the wombs of females—but no
soul knoweth what it shall have gotten on the morrow; neither
<span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>wotteth any soul in what land it shall die: Verily Allah is knowing,

and I, by Allah, thought only to try thee.” Rejoined she, “Know
that the almanack-makers have certain signs and tokens, referring
to the planets and constellations relative to the coming in of the
year; and folk have learned something by experience.” (¿) “What
be that?”—Each day hath a planet that ruleth it: so if the first
day in the year fall on First Day (Sunday) that day is the Sun’s
and this portendeth (though Allah alone is All-knowing!) oppression
of kings and sultans and governors and much miasma and
lack of rain; and that people will be in great tumult and the grain-crop
will be good, except lentils, which will perish, and the vines
will rot and flax will be dear and wheat cheap from the beginning
of Túbah to the end of Barmahát.<a id="r423"></a><a href="#f423" class="c011"><sup>[423]</sup></a> And, in this year there will
be much fighting among kings, and there shall be great plenty of
good in this year, but Allah is All-knowing! (¿) “What if the first
day fall on Second Day (Monday)?”—That day belongeth to the
Moon and portendeth righteousness in administrators and officials;
and that it will be a year of much rain and grain-crops will be
good, but linseed will decay and wheat will be cheap in the month
Kiyáhk;<a id="r424"></a><a href="#f424" class="c011"><sup>[424]</sup></a> also the plague will rage and the sheep and goats

<span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>her “Now tell me what will occur if New Year’s day fall on Third
Day (Tuesday).” She replied, That is Mars’ day and portendeth
death of great men and much destruction and deluge of blood
and dearness of grain; lack of rain and scarcity of fish, which will
anon be in excess and anon fail. Lentils and honey in this year
will be cheap and linseed dear and only barley will thrive, to the
exception of all other cereals: great will be the fighting among
kings and death will be in the blood and there will be much mortality
among asses. (¿) “What if it fall on Fourth Day?”—That
is Mercury’s day and portendeth great tumult among the folk and
much enmity and, though rains be moderate, rotting of some of
the green crops; also that there will be sore mortality among
cattle and young children and much fighting by sea; that wheat
will be dear from Barmúdah to Misra<a id="r425"></a><a href="#f425" class="c011"><sup>[425]</sup></a> and other grains cheap;
thunder and lightning will abound and honey will be dear, palm-trees
will thrive and bear abundantly and flax and cotton will be
plentiful, while radishes and onions will be dear; but Allah is
All-knowing! (¿) “What if it fall on Fifth Day?”—That is
Jupiter’s day and portendeth equity in Wazirs and righteousness
in Kazis and Fakirs and the Ministers of religion; and that good
will be plentiful: rains and fruit and trees and grain will abound,
and flax, cotton, honey, grapes and fish be cheap; and Allah is
Omniscient! (¿) “What if it fall on Meeting Day or Friday?”—That
day appertaineth to Venus and portendeth oppression in the
chiefs of the Jinn and talk of forgery and back-biting; there will
be much dew; the autumn crops will be good in the land and there
will be cheapness in one town and not in another: ungraciousness
will be rife by land and sea; linseed will be dear, also wheat, in
Hátúr, but cheap in Amshír; honey will be dear and grapes and
water-melons will rot; and Allah is Omniscient! (¿) “What if it
fall on the Sabbath (Saturday)?”—“That is Saturn’s day and portendeth
the preferment of slaves and Greeks and those in whom
there is no good, neither in their neighbourhood; there will be
great drought and dearth; clouds will abound and death will be
rife among the sons of Adam and woe to the people of Egypt and
Syria from the oppression of the Sultan and failure of blessing

<span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>Now with this, the astronomer hung his head very
low, and she said to him, “O astronomer, I will ask thee one
question, which if thou answer not, I will take thy clothes.” “Ask,”
replied he. Quoth she, “Where is Saturn’s dwelling-place?”; and
he answered, “In the seventh heaven.” (¿) “And that of Jupiter?”—In
the sixth heaven. (¿) “And that of Mars?”—In the
fifth heaven. (¿) “And that of the Sun?”—In the fourth heaven.
(¿) “And that of Venus?”—In the third heaven. (¿) “And that of
Mercury?”—In the second heaven. (¿) “And that of the Moon?”—In
the first heaven. Quoth she, “Well answered; but I have one
more question to ask thee;” and quoth he, “Ask!” Accordingly
she said, “Now tell me concerning the stars, into how many
parts are they divided.” But he was silent and answered nothing;
and she cried to him, “Put off thy clothes.” So he doffed them
and she took them; after which the Caliph said to her, “Tell us
the answer to thy question.” She replied:—O Commander of the
Faithful, the stars are divided into three parts, whereof one-third
is hung in the sky of the earth,<a id="r427"></a><a href="#f427" class="c011"><sup>[427]</sup></a> as it were lamps, to give light to
the earth, and a part is used to shoot the demons withal, when
they draw near by stealth to listen to the talk in heaven. Quoth
Allah Almighty, ‘Verily, we have dight the sky of the earth with
the adornment of the stars; and have appointed them for projectiles
against every rebellious Satan.’<a id="r428"></a><a href="#f428" class="c011"><sup>[428]</sup></a> And the third part is hung
in air to illuminate the seas and give light to what is therein.
Quoth the astronomer, “I have one more question to ask, which if

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
astronomer said, “Now tell me what four contraries are based
upon other four contraries?” Replied she, “The four qualities
of Caloric and Frigoric, Humidity and Siccity; for of heat Allah
created fire, whose nature is hot-dry; of dryness, earth, which is
cold-dry; of cold, water, which is cold-wet; of moisture, air, which
is hot-wet. Moreover, He created twelve Signs of the Zodiac,
Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio,
Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces; and appointed them
of the four humours; three fiery, Aries, Leo, and Sagittarius; three
earthy, Taurus, Virgo, and Capricorn; three airy, Gemini, Libra
and Aquarius; and three watery, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces.”
Hereupon the astronomer rose, and saying, “Bear witness against
me that she is more learned than I,” away he went beaten. Then
quoth the Caliph, “Where is the philosopher<a id="r429"></a><a href="#f429" class="c011"><sup>[429]</sup></a>?”; at which one
rose hastily and came forward and said to Tawaddud, “What is
Time and what be its limits, and its days, and what things bringeth
it?” Replied she, “Time is a term applied to the hours of the
night and day, which are but the measures of the courses of the
sun and moon in their several heavens, even as Allah Almighty
telleth us when he saith, ‘A sign to them also is the Night, from
which we strip off the day, and lo! they are plunged in darkness,

of the Sublime, the All-knowing.’”<a id="r430"></a><a href="#f430" class="c011"><sup>[430]</sup></a> (¿) “How cometh unbelief to

Time and night and the Hour.’ And again, ‘Let none of you

ass and Salih’s camel and Duldul the mule of the Prophet (upon
whom be blessings and peace!). (¿) “What man prayed a prayer
neither on earth nor in heaven?”—Solomon, when he prayed on
his carpet, borne by the wind. (¿) “Ree me this riddle:—A man
once looked at a handmaid during dawn-prayer, and she was unlawful
to him; but, at noonday she became lawful to him: by
mid-afternoon, she was again unlawful, but at sundown, she was

by daybreak, she became once more lawful to him.”—This was a
man who looked at another’s slave-girl in the morning, and she

became lawful to him: at mid-afternoon he freed her, and she

was again lawful to him. At nightfall he divorced her and
she was then a third time unlawful to him; but, next morning
at daybreak, he took her back, and she became once more lawful

(¿) “What spot of lowland is it, upon which the sun shone once,

There came forward a sage hight Ibrahim bin Siyyár and said

Allah, I will assuredly conquer thee and make thee a byword

“Do penance in advance for thy broken oath.” Then he asked,
“What five things did Allah create before he made man?”; and
she answered, “Water and earth and light and darkness and the
fruits of the earth.” (¿) “What did Allah create with the hand
of omnipotence?”—The ‘Arsh, throne of God or the empyreal
heaven and the tree Túbá<a id="r439"></a><a href="#f439" class="c011"><sup>[439]</sup></a> and Adam and the garden of Eden;

the Friend of God. (¿) “What is the Faith of Al-Islam?”—The
professing that there is no God but <em>the</em> God and
that Mohammed is the apostle of God. (¿) “What is thy first

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel had described to him Al-Sirat, the philosopher said,
“Inform me how many intercessions with Allah hath the Prophet
for each soul?”<a id="r447"></a><a href="#f447" class="c011"><sup>[447]</sup></a>—Three. (¿) “Was Abu Bakr the first
who embraced Al-Islam?”—Yes. (¿) “Yet Ali became a Moslem
before him?”—Ali came to the Prophet, when he was a boy of
seven years old, for Allah vouchsafed him knowledge of the way
of salvation in his tender youth, so that he never prostrated himself
to idols. Quoth he, “Tell me which is the more excellent,
Ali or Abbás?” Now she knew that, in propounding this question,
Ibrahim was laying a trap for her; for if she said, “Ali is more
excellent than Abbas,” she would lack excuse with the Caliph for
undervaluing his ancestor; so she bowed her head awhile, now
reddening, then paling, and lastly said, “Thou askest me of two
excellent men, each having his own excellence. Let us return to
what we were about.” When the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard
her, he stood up and said, “Thou hast spoken well, by the Lord of
the Ka’abah, O Tawaddud!” Then quoth Ibrahim the rhetorician,
“What meaneth the poet when he saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She answered, “The sugar-cane;” and he said, “Tell me of many
<span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>things.” Asked she, “What are they?” and he said, “What is
sweeter than honey; what is sharper than the sword; what is
swifter than poison; what is the delight of a moment and what
the contentment of three days; what is the pleasantest of days;
what is the joy of a week; what is that debt the worst debtor
denieth not; what is the prison of the tomb; what is the joy of
the heart; what is the snare of the soul; what is death-in-life;
what is the disease that may not be healed; what is the shame
that may not be wiped off; what is the beast that woneth not in
cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places and hateth the sons
of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the make of seven strong
and violent beasts?” Quoth she, “Hear what I shall say in
reply; then put off thy clothes, that I may explain to thee;”
and the Caliph said, “Expound, and he shall doff his clothes.” So
she said, “Now that, which is sweeter than honey, is the love of
pious children to their two parents; that, which is sharper than
the sword, is the tongue; that, which is swifter than poison, is the
Envier’s eye; the delight of a moment is carnal copulation and
the contentment of three days is the depilatory for women; the
pleasantest of days is that of profit on merchandise; the joy of a
week is the bride; the debt, which the worst debtor denieth not, is
death; the prison of the tomb is a bad son; the joy of the heart
is a woman obedient to her husband (and it is said also that, when
fleshmeat descendeth upon the heart, it rejoiceth therein); the
snare of the soul is a disobedient slave; death-in-life is poverty;
the disease that may not be healed is an ill-nature, and the shame
that may not be wiped away is an ill daughter; lastly, the beast
that woneth not in cultivated fields, but lodgeth in waste places
and hateth the sons of Adam and hath in him somewhat of the
make of seven strong and violent beasts, is the locust, whose head
is as the head of a horse, its neck as the neck of the bull, its wings
as the wings of the vulture, its feet as the feet of the camel, its tail
as the tail of the serpent, its belly as the belly of the scorpion and
its horns as the horns of the gazelle.” The Caliph was astounded
at her quickness and understanding, and said to the rhetorician,
“Doff thy clothes.” So he rose up and cried, “I call all who are
present in this assembly to witness that she is more learned than
I and every other learned man.” And he put off his clothes and
gave them to her, saying, “Take them and may Allah not bless
them to thee!” So the Caliph ordered him fresh clothes and said,
“O Tawaddud, there is one thing left of that for which thou didst
<span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>engage, namely, chess.” And he sent for experts of chess and
cards<a id="r448"></a><a href="#f448" class="c011"><sup>[448]</sup></a> and trictrac. The chess-player sat down before her, and
they set the pieces, and he moved and she moved; but, every move
he made she speedily countered,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
damsel was playing chess with the expert in presence of the Commander
of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, whatever move he made
was speedily countered by her, till she beat him and he found himself
checkmated. Quoth he, “I did but lead thee on, that thou
mightest think thyself skilful: but set up again, and thou shalt
see.” So they placed the pieces a second time, when he said in
himself, “Open thine eyes or she will beat thee.” And he fell to
moving no piece, save after calculation, and ceased not to play, till
she said, “Thy King is dead!—Checkmate.” When he saw this
he was confounded at her quickness and understanding; but she
laughed and said, “O professor, I will make a wager with thee on
this third game. I will give thee the queen and the right-hand
castle and the left-hand knight; if thou beat me, take my clothes,
and if I beat thee, I will take thy clothes.” Replied he, “I agree
to this;” and they replaced the pieces, she removing queen, castle
and knight.<a id="r449"></a><a href="#f449" class="c011"><sup>[449]</sup></a> Then said she, “Move, O master.” So he moved,
saying to himself, “I cannot but beat her, with such odds,” and
planned a combination; but, behold, she moved on, little by little,
till she made one of her pawns<a id="r450"></a><a href="#f450" class="c011"><sup>[450]</sup></a> a queen and pushing up to him
<span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>pawns and other pieces, to take off his attention, set one in his way
and tempted him to take it. Accordingly, he took it and she
said to him, “The measure is meted and the loads equally
balanced.<a id="r451"></a><a href="#f451" class="c011"><sup>[451]</sup></a> Eat till thou art over-full; naught shall be thy ruin,
O son of Adam, save thy greed. Knowest thou not that I did but
tempt thee, that I might finesse thee? See: this is check-mate!”
adding, “So doff off thy clothes.” Quoth he, “Leave me my bag-trousers,
so Allah repay thee;” and he swore by Allah that he
would contend with none, so long as Tawaddud abode in the realm
of Baghdad. Then he stripped off his clothes and gave them to
her and went away. Thereupon came the backgammon-player,
and she said to him, “If I beat thee, this day, what wilt thou give
me?” Quoth he, “I will give thee ten suits of brocade of Constantinople,
figured with gold, and ten suits of velvet and a
thousand gold pieces; and if I beat thee, I ask nothing but that
thou write me an acknowledgment of my victory.” Quoth she,
“To it, then, and do thy best.” So they played, and he lost and
went away, chattering in Frankish jargon and saying, “By the
bounty of the Commander of the Faithful, there is not her like
in all the regions of the world!” Then the Caliph summoned
players on instruments of music and asked her, “Dost thou know
aught of music?”; when she answered, “Even so!” He bade
bring a worn lute, polished by use, whose owner forlorn and lone
was by parting trodden down; and of which quoth one, describing
it:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So they brought the lute in a bag of red satin, with tassels of
saffron-coloured silk: and she opened the bag, and took it out and
behold on it was graven:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>She laid her lute in her lap and with bosom inclining over it, bent
to it with the bending of a mother who suckleth her child; then
she preluded in twelve different modes, till the whole assembly
was agitated with delight, like a waving sea, and she sang the
following:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Caliph was ravished and exclaimed, “Allah bless thee and
be merciful to him who taught thee!”: whereupon she rose and
kissed the ground before him. Then he sent for money and
paid her master Abu al-Husn an hundred thousand gold pieces
to her price; after which he said to her, “O Tawaddud, ask a
boon of me!” Replied she, “I ask of thee that thou restore
me to my lord who sold me.” “‘Tis well,” answered the Caliph
and restored her to her master and gave her five thousand dinars
for herself. Moreover, he appointed Abu al-Husn one of his cup-companions
for a permanence,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

her learning and understanding and her perfect excellence in all
branches of art and science; and consider the generosity of the
Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, in that he gave her
master this money and said to her, “Ask a boon of me;” and she
besought him to restore her to her lord. So he restored her to

disputes and casuistical questions. Its text runs (chapt. v.), “O true believers, when
you prepare to pray, wash (Ghusl) your faces, and your hands unto the elbows; and rub
(Mas-h) your hands and your feet unto the ankles; and if ye be unclean by having lain
with a woman, wash (Ghusl) yourselves all over.” The purifications and ceremonious
ablutions of the Jews originated this command; and the early Christians did very
unwisely in not making the bath obligatory. St. Paul (Heb. xi. 22) says, “Let us
draw near with a true heart ... having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience
and our bodies washed with clean (or pure) water.” But this did not suffice. Hence the
Eastern Christian, in hot climates where cleanliness should rank before godliness, is
distinguished by his dirt which as a holy or reverend man he makes still dirtier, and he
offers an ugly comparison with the Moslem and especially the Hindu. The neglect of
commands to wash and prohibitions to drink strong waters are the two grand physical
objections of the Christian code of morality.</p>

practice of the Prophet, the rite is not indispensable for converts, especially the aged and
the sick. Our ideas upon the subject are very hazy for modern “niceness” allows a
“Feast of the Circumcision,” but no discussion thereon. Moses (alias Osarsiph) borrowed
the rite from the Egyptian hierophants who were all thus “purified”; the object
being to counteract the over-sensibility of the “sixth sense” and to harden the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">glans</span></i>
against abrasions and infection by exposure to air and friction against the dress. Almost
all African tribes practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious: I
shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al-Salkh (the flaying) still practised in
the Arabian province Al-Asír (Pilgrimage iii. 80). There is a difference too between
the Hebrew and the Moslem rite. The Jewish operator, after snipping off the foreskin,
rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb-nails so that the external cutis does not
retract far from the internal; and the wound, when healed, shows a narrow ring of
cicatrice. This ripping is not done by Moslems. They use a stick as a probe passed
round between glans and prepuce to ascertain the extent of the frenum and that there
is no abnormal adhesion. The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the
forceps, a fork of two bamboo splints, five or six inches long by a quarter thick, or in
some cases an iron like our compasses. This is tied tightly over the foreskin so as to
exclude about an inch and a half of the prepuce above and three quarters below. A
single stroke of the razor drawn directly downwards removes the skin. The slight
bleeding is stopped by burnt rags or ashes and healed with cerates, pledgets and fumigations.
Thus Moslem circumcision does not prevent the skin retracting.</p>

in his hand the lot of Jerusalem” <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> the arrow whereon the city-name was written.
The Arabs use it for casting lots with ten azlam or headless arrows (for dice) three
being blanks and the rest notched from one to seven. They were thrown by a “Zárib”
or punter and the stake was generally a camel. Amongst so excitable a people as
the Arabs, this game caused quarrels and bloodshed, hence its prohibition: and the
theologians, who everywhere and at all times delight in burdening human nature, have
extended the command, which is rather admonitory than prohibitive, to all games of
chance. Tarafah is supposed to allude to this practice in his Mu’allakah.</p>

Koranic rejection of Nasy or intercalation makes their lunar months describe
the whole circle of the seasons in a cycle of about thirty-three and a half years. Yet they
have retained the terms which contain the original motive of the denomination. The
first month is Muharram, the “Holy,” because war was forbidden; it was also known as
Safar No. 1. The second Safar = “Emptiness,” because during the heats citizens left
the towns and retired to Táif and other cool sites. Rabí’a (first and second) alluded to
the spring-pasturages; Jumádá (first and second) to the “hardening” of the dry ground
and, according to some, to the solidification, freezing, of the water in the highlands.
Rajab (No. 7) = “worshipping,” especially by sacrifice, is also known as Al-Asamm
the deaf; because being sacred, the rattle of arms was unheard. Sha’abán = “collecting,”
dispersing, ruining, because the tribal wars recommenced: Ramazan (intensely
hot) has been explained and Shawwál (No. 10.) derives from Shaul (elevating) when the
he-camels raise their tails in rut. Zú’l-Ka’adah, the sedentary, is the rest time of the
year, when fighting is forbidden and Zu’l-Hijjah explains itself as the pilgrimage-month.</p>

because conceived by Gabriel in the shape of a beautiful youth breathing into the
Virgin’s vulva. Hence Moslems believe in a “miraculous conception” and consequently
determine that one so conceived was, like Elias and Khizr, not subject to
death; they also hold him born free from “original sin” (a most sinful superstition), a
veil being placed before the Virgin and Child against the Evil One who could not touch
them. He spoke when a babe in cradle; he performed miracles of physic; he was
taken up to Heaven; he will appear as the forerunner of Mohammed on the White
Tower of Damascus, and finally he will be buried at Al-Medinah. The Jews on the
other hand speak of him as “that man:” they hold that he was begotten by Joseph
during the menstrual period and therefore a born magician. Moreover he learned the
Sham ha-maphrash or Nomen tetragrammaton, wrote it on parchment and placed it in
an incision in his thigh, which closed up on the Name being mentioned (Buxtorf, Lex

  <h2 id="c246" class="c007">THE ANGEL OF DEATH WITH THE PROUD KING AND THE DEVOUT MAN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">It is related, O auspicious King, that one of the olden monarchs
was once minded to ride out in state with the officers of his realm
and the Grandees of his retinue and display to the folk the marvels
of his magnificence. So he ordered his Lords and Emirs equip
them therefor and commanded his keeper of the wardrobe to
bring him of the richest of raiment, such as befitted the King in
his state; and he bade them bring his steeds<a id="r453"></a><a href="#f453" class="c011"><sup>[453]</sup></a> of the finest breeds
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>and pedigrees every man heeds; which being done, he chose out
of the raiment what rejoiced him most and of the horses that which
he deemed best; and, donning the clothes, together with a collar
set with margarites and rubies and all manner jewels, mounted and
set forth in state, making his destrier prance and curvet among his
troops and glorying in his pride and despotic power. And Iblis
came to him and, laying his hand upon his nose, blew into his
nostrils the breath of hauteur and conceit, so that he magnified
and glorified himself and said in his heart, “Who among men is
like unto me?” And he became so puffed up with arrogance and
self-sufficiency, and so taken up with the thought of his own
splendour and magnificence, that he would not vouchsafe a glance
to any man. Presently, there stood before him one clad in
tattered clothes and saluted him, but he returned not his salam;
whereupon the stranger laid hold of his horse’s bridle. “Lift thy
hand,” cried the King, “thou knowest not whose bridle-rein it is
whereof thou takest hold.” Quoth the other, “I have a need of
thee.” Quoth the King, “Wait till I alight and then name thy
need.” Rejoined the stranger, “It is a secret and I will not tell
it but in thine ear.” So the King bowed his head to him and he
said, “I am the Angel of Death and I purpose to take thy soul.”
Replied the King, “Have patience with me a little, whilst I return
to my house and take leave of my people and children and neighbours
and wife.” “By no means so,” answered the Angel; “thou
shalt never return nor look on them again, for the fated term of
thy life is past.” So saying, he took the soul of the King (who
fell off his horse’s back dead) and departed thence. Presently the
Death Angel met a devout man, of whom Almighty Allah had
accepted, and saluted him. He returned the salute, and the Angel
said to him, “O pious man, I have a need of thee which must be
kept secret.” “Tell it in my ear,” quoth the devotee; and quoth
the other, “I am the Angel of Death.” Replied the man, “Welcome
to thee! and praised be Allah for thy coming! I am aweary of
awaiting thine arrival; for indeed long hath been thine absence
from the lover which longeth for thee.” Said the Angel, “If thou
have any business, make an end of it;” but the other answered,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>saying, “There is nothing so urgent to me as the meeting with
my Lord, to whom be honour and glory!” And the Angel said
“How wouldst thou fain have me take thy soul? I am bidden to
take it as thou willest and choosest.” He replied, “Tarry till I
make the Wuzu-ablution and pray; and, when I prostrate myself,
then take my soul while my body is on the ground.”<a id="r454"></a><a href="#f454" class="c011"><sup>[454]</sup></a> Quoth the
Angel, “Verily, my Lord (be He extolled and exalted!) commanded
me not to take thy soul but with thy consent and as thou
shouldst wish; so I will do thy will.” Then the devout man made
the minor ablution<a id="r455"></a><a href="#f455" class="c011"><sup>[455]</sup></a> and prayed: and the Angel of Death took his
soul in the act of prostration and Almighty Allah transported it
to the place of mercy and acceptance and forgiveness. And they

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r453">453</a>.  </span>The popular English idea of the Arab horse is founded upon utter unfact. Book
after book tells us, “There are three distinct breeds of Arabians—the <em>Attechi</em>, a very
superior breed; the <em>Kadishi</em>, mixed with these and of little value; and the <em>Kochlani</em>,
highly prized and very difficult to procure.” “Attechi” may be At-Tází (the Arab horse,
or hound) or some confusion with “At” (Turk.) a horse. “Kadish” (Gadish or Kidish)
is a nag; a gelding, a hackney, a “pacer” (generally called “Rahwán”). “Kochlani”
is evidently “Kohláni,” the Kohl-eyed, because the skin round the orbits is dark as if
powdered. This is the true blue blood; and the bluest of all is “Kohláni al-Ajúz” (of
the old woman) a name thus accounted for. An Arab mare dropped a filly when in
flight; her rider perforce gallopped on and presently saw the foal appear in camp, when
it was given to an old woman for nursing and grew up to be famous. The home of the
Arab horse is the vast plateau of Al-Najd: the Tahámah or lower maritime regions of
Arabia, like Malabar, will not breed good beasts. The pure blood all descends from five
collateral lines called Al-Khamsah (the Cinque). Literary and pedantic Arabs derive
them from the mares of Mohammed a native of the dry and rocky region, Al-Hijaz,
whither horses are all imported. Others go back (with the Koran, chapt. xxviii.) to
Solomon, possibly Salmán, a patriarch fourth in descent from Ishmael and some 600
years older than the Hebrew King. The Badawi derive the five from Rabí’at al-Faras
(R. of the mare) fourth in descent from Adnán, the fount of Arab genealogy. But they
differ about the names: those generally given are Kahilan (Kohaylat), Sakláwi (which
the Badawin pronounce Sagláwi), Abayán, and Hamdáni; others substitute Manákhi (the
long-maned), Tanís and Jalfún. These require no certificate amongst Arabs; for
strangers a simple statement is considered enough. The Badawin despise all half-breeds
(Arab sires and country mares), Syrian, Turkish, Kurdish and Egyptian. They call these
(first mentioned in the reign of Ahmes, B.C. 1600) the “sons of horses”; as opposed to
“sons of mares,” or thorough-breds. Nor do they believe in city-bred animals. I
have great doubts concerning our old English sires, such as the Darley Arabian which
looks like a Kurdish half-bred, the descendant of those Cappadocians so much prized by
the Romans: in Syria I rode a “Harfúshí” (Kurd) the very image of it. There is no
difficulty in buying Arab stallions except the price. Of course the tribe does not like to
part with what may benefit the members generally; but offers of £500 to £1,000 would
overcome men’s scruples. It is different with mares, which are almost always the joint
property of several owners. The people too dislike to see a hat on a thorough-bred
mare: “What hast thou done that thou art ridden by that ill-omened Kafir?” the
Badawin used to mutter when they saw a highly respectable missionary at Damascus
mounting a fine Ruwalá mare. The feeling easily explains the many wars about horses
occurring in Arab annals, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> about Dáhis and Ghabrá. (C. de Perceval, <em>Essai</em>, vol. ii.)</p>

case with the late Mr. Emmanuel Deutsch, who in his well-known article on the Talmud
had the courage to speak of “Our Saviour.” But as a rule the Israelite, though he
mostly appears as a Deist, a Unitarian, has a fund of fanatical feelings which crop up in
old age and near death. The “converts” in Syria and elsewhere, whose Judaism is
intensified by “conversion,” when offers are made to them by the missionaries repair to
the Khákhám (scribe) and, after abundant wrangling determine upon a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">modus vivendi</span></i>.
They are to pay a proportion of their wages, to keep careful watch in the cause of Israel
and to die orthodox. In Istria there is a legend of a Jew Prior in a convent who was
not discovered till he announced himself most unpleasantly on his death-bed. For a
contrary reason to Jewish humility the Roman Emperors preferred to die standing.</p>

  <h2 id="c248" class="c007">THE ANGEL OF DEATH AND THE RICH KING.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">A certain King had heaped up coin beyond count and gathered
store of all precious things, which Allah the Most Highest hath
created. So, in order that he might take his pleasure whenas he
should find leisure to enjoy all this abounding wealth he had
collected, he built him a palace wide and lofty such as besitteth
and beseemeth Kings; and set thereto strong doors and appointed,
for its service and its guard, servants and soldiers and doorkeepers to
watch and ward. One day, he bade the cooks dress him somewhat
of the goodliest of food and assembled his household and retainers
and boon-companions and servants to eat with him, and partake
of his bounty. Then he sat down upon the sofa of his kingship
and dominion; and, propping his elbow upon the cushion, addressed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>himself, saying, “O soul, thou hast gathered together all the wealth
of the world; so now take thy leisure therein and eat of this good
at thine ease, in long life and prosperity ever rife!”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that hardly had
the King made an end of saying to himself, “Eat of this weal at
thine ease, in long life and prosperity ever rife!” when a man
clad in tattered raiment, with an asker’s wallet hanging at his
neck, as he were one who came to beg food, knocked with the
door-ring a knock so loud and terrible that the whole palace shook
as with quake of earth and the King’s throne trembled. The
servants were affrighted and rushed to the door, and when they
saw the man who had knocked they cried out at him, saying,
“Woe to thee! what manner of unmannerly fashion be this?
Wait till the King eateth and we will then give thee of what is
left.” Quoth he, “Tell your lord to come out and speak with me,
for I have of him a pressing need and a matter to heed.” They
cried, “Away, fool! who art thou that we should bid our lord come
forth to thee?” But he said, “Tell him of this.” So they went in
and told the King, who said, “Did ye not rebuke him and draw
upon him and threaten him!” Now as he spoke, behold, there
came another knock at the gate, louder than the first knock,
whereupon the servants sprang at the stranger with staves and
weapons, to fall upon him and slay him; but he shouted at them,
saying, “Bide in your steads, for I am the Angel of Death.”
Hereat their hearts quaked and their wits forsook them; their
understandings were in confusion, their side-muscles quivered in
perturbation and their limbs lost the power of motion. Then said
the King to them, “Tell him to take a substitute<a id="r456"></a><a href="#f456" class="c011"><sup>[456]</sup></a> in my place
and one to relieve me in this case.” But the Angel answered,
saying, “I will take no substitute, and I come not but on thine
account, to cause separation between thee and the goods thou hast
gathered together and the riches thou hast heaped up and entreasured.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_249">249</span>When the King heard this, he wept and groaned, saying,
“Allah curse the treasure which hath deluded and undone me
and diverted me from the service of my Lord! I deemed it would
profit me, but to-day it is a regret for me and a calamity to me,
and behold, I go forth, empty-handed of it, and leave it to my
foes.” Thereupon Allah caused the Treasure to speak out and
it said, “Wherefore cursest thou me?<a id="r457"></a><a href="#f457" class="c011"><sup>[457]</sup></a> Curse thyself, for Allah
created both me and eke thyself of the dust and appointed me
to be in thine hand, that thou mightest provide thee with me a
viaticum for the next world and give alms with me to the poor
and the needy and the sick; and build mosques and hospices and
bridges and aqueducts, so might I be an aidance unto thee in the
world to come. But thou didst garner me and hoard me up and
on thine own vanities bestowest me, neither gavest thou thanks
for me, as was due, but wast ungrateful to me; and now thou must
leave me to thy foes and thou hast naught save thy regretting and
thy repenting. But what is my sin, that thou shouldest revile me?”
Then the Angel of Death took the King’s soul as he sat on his
throne before he ate of the food, and he fell down dead. Quoth
Allah Almighty, “While they were rejoicing for that which had
been given them, we suddenly laid hold on them; and, behold,
they were seized with despair.”<a id="r458"></a><a href="#f458" class="c011"><sup>[458]</sup></a> And they tell another tale of</p>

<p class="c012">There was a puissant despot among the Kings of the Banú Isráíl,
who sat one day upon the throne of his kingship, when he saw
come in to him, by the gate of the hall, a man of forbidding aspect
and horrible presence. The King was affrighted at his sudden
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>intrusion and his look terrified him; so he sprang up before him
and said, “Who art thou, O man? Who gave thee leave to come
in to me and who invited thee to enter my house?” Quoth the
stranger, “Verily the Lord of the House sent me to thee, nor can
any doorkeeper exclude me, nor need I leave to come in to Kings;

to himself, he asked, “Art thou then the Angel of Death?”; and

the King, “grant me one single day’s respite, that I may pray
pardon of my sins and ask absolution of my Lord and restore to

</div>

<p class="c012">It is related that Iskandar Zu al-Karnayn<a id="r461"></a><a href="#f461" class="c011"><sup>[461]</sup></a> once came, in his
journeyings, upon a tribe of small folk, who owned naught of the
weals of the world and who dug their graves over against the
doors of their houses and were wont at all times to visit them and
sweep the earth from them and keep them clean and pray at them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>and worship Almighty Allah at them; and they had no meat save
grasses and the growth of the ground. So Iskandar sent a man
to summon their King, but he refused to come, saying, “I have no
need of him.” Thereupon Iskandar went to him and said, “How
is it with you and what manner of men are ye?; for I see with
you forsooth naught of gold or silver, nor find I with you aught
of the weals of the world.” Answered the King, “None hath his
fill of the weals of the world.” Iskandar then asked “Why do
you dig your graves before your house-doors?”; and the King
answered, “That they may be the prospective of our eye-glances;
so we may look on them and ever renew talk and thought of
death, neither forget the world to come; and on this wise the love
of the world be banished from our hearts and we be not thereby
distracted from the service of our Lord, the Almighty.” Quoth
Iskandar, “Why do ye eat grasses?”; and the other replied,
“Because we abhor to make our bellies the tombs of animals
and because the pleasure of eating outstrippeth not the gullet.”
Then putting forth his hand he brought out a skull of a son
of Adam and, laying it before Iskandar, said, “O Zu al-Karnayn,
Lord of the Two Horns, knowest thou who owned this skull?”
Quoth he, “Nay;” and quoth the other, “He who owned this
skull was a King of the Kings of the world, who dealt tyrannously
with his subjects, specially wronging the weak and wasting his
time in heaping up the rubbish of this world, till Allah took his
sprite and made the fire his abiding-site; and this is his head.”
He then put forth his hand and produced another skull and, laying
it before Iskandar, said to him, “Knowest thou this?” “No,”
answered the conqueror; and the other rejoined, “This is the
skull of another King, who dealt justly by his lieges and was
kindly solicitous for the folk of his realm and his dominions, till
Allah took his soul and lodged him in His Garden and made high
his degree in Heaven.” Then laying his hands on Iskandar’s
head he said, “Would I knew which of these two art thou.”
Whereupon Iskandar wept with sore weeping and straining the
King to his bosom cried, “If thou be minded to company with me,
I will commit to thee as Wazir the government of my affairs and
share with thee my kingdom.” Cried the other, “Well-away,
well-away! I have no mind to this.” “And why so?” asked
Iskandar, and the King answered, “Because all men are thy
foes by reason of the wealth and the worlds thou hast won:
<span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>while all men are my true friends, because of my contentment
and pauperdom, for that I possess nothing, neither covet aught
of the goods of life; I have no desire to them nor wish for
them, neither reck I aught save contentment.” So Iskandar
pressed him to his breast and kissed him between the eyes and
went his way.<a id="r462"></a><a href="#f462" class="c011"><sup>[462]</sup></a> And among the tales they tell is one concerning</p>

West) much “Matagrobolized” and very different from him of Macedon. The title is
variously explained, from two protuberances on his head or helm, from two long locks
and, possibly, from the ram-horns of Jupiter Ammon. The anecdote in the text
seems suggested by the famous interview (probably a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">canard</span></i>) with Diogenes: see
in the Gesta, Tale cxlvi. “The answer of Diomedes the Pirate to Alexander.”
Iskandar was originally called Marzbán (Lord of the Marches), son of Marzabah;
and, though descended from Yunán, son of Japhet, the eponymus of the Greeks,
was born obscure, the son of an old woman. According to the Persians he was the
son of the Elder Dáráb (Darius Codomannus of the Kayanian or Second dynasty),
by a daughter of Philip of Macedon; and was brought up by his grandfather. When
Abraham and Isaac had rebuilt the Ka’abah they foregathered with him and Allah
sent him forth against the four quarters of the earth to convert men to the faith of
the Friend or to cut their throats; thus he became one of the four world-conquerors
with Nimrod, Solomon, Bukht al-Nasr (Nabochodonosor); and he lived down two
generations of men. His Wazir was Aristú (the Greek Aristotle) and he carried a
couple of flags, white and black, which made day and night for him and facilitated
his conquests. At the end of Persia, where he was invited by the people, on
account of the cruelty of his half brother Darab II., he came upon two huge mountains
on the same line, behind which dwelt a host of abominable pygmies, two spans
high, with curious eyes, ears which served as mattresses and coverlets, huge fanged
mouths, lions’ claws and hairy hind quarters. They ate men, destroyed everything,
copulated in public and had swarms of children. These were Yájúj and Májúj (Gog
and Magog) descendants of Japhet. Sikandar built against them the famous wall
with stones cemented and riveted by iron and copper. The “Great Wall” of China,
the famous bulwark against the Tartars dates from B.C. 320; (Alexander of Macedon
died B.C. 324) and as the Arabs knew Canton well before Mohammed’s day, they
may have built their romance upon it. The Guebres consigned Sikandar to hell for
burning the Nusks or sections of the Zendavesta.</p>

produce of Oriental tale-literature and form the chiaro-oscuro, as it were, of a picture
whose lights are brilliant touches of profanity and indelicate humour. It certainly has
the charm of contrast. Much of the above is taken from the Sikandar-nameh (Alexander
Book) of the great Persian poet, Nizámi, who flourished A.H. 515–597, between the
days of Firdausi (ob. A.D. 1021) and Sa’adi (ob. A.D. 1291). In that romance
Sikandar builds, “where the sun goes down,” a castle of glittering stone which kills
men by causing excessive laughter and surrounds it with yellow earth like gold. Hence
the City of Brass. He also converts, instead of being converted by, the savages of the
text. He finds a stone of special excellence which he calls Almás (diamond); and he
obtains it from the Valley of Serpents by throwing down flesh to the eagles. Lastly he
is accompanied by “Bilínás” or “Bilínús,” who is apparently Apollonius of Tyana.</p>

pink of perfection.” And ken thou, O King, continued Shahrazad,
that these olden Kings strave not and toiled not for the peopling
of their possessions, but because they knew that the more populous
a country is, the more abundant is that which is desired therein;
and because they wist the saying of the wise and the learned to be
true without other view, namely, “Religion dependeth on the King,
the King on the troops, the troops on the treasury, the treasury on
the populousness of the country and its prosperity on the justice
done to the lieges.” Wherefore they upheld no one in tyranny or
oppression; neither suffered their dependants and suite to work
injustice, knowing that kingdoms are not established upon tyranny,
but that cities and places fall into ruin when oppressors are set as
rulers over them, and their inhabitants disperse and flee to other
governments; whereby ruin falleth upon the realm, the imports
fail, the treasuries become empty and the pleasant lives of the
subjects are perturbed; for that they love not a tyrant and cease
not to offer up successive prayers against him; so that the King
hath no ease of his kingdom, and the vicissitudes of fortune
speedily bring him to destruction. And they tell a tale concerning</p>

  <h2 id="c256" class="c007">THE JEWISH KAZI AND HIS PIOUS WIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">Among the Children of Israel one of the Kazis had a wife of
surpassing beauty, constant in fasting and abounding in patience
and long-suffering; and he, being minded to make the pilgrimage
to Jerusalem, appointed his own brother Kazi in his stead, during
his absence, and commended his wife to his charge. Now this
brother had heard of her beauty and loveliness and had taken a
fancy to her. So no sooner was his brother gone than he went to
her and sought her love-favours; but she denied him and held fast
to her chastity. The more she repelled him, the more he pressed
his suit upon her; till, despairing of her and fearing lest she should
acquaint his brother with his misconduct whenas he should return,
he suborned false witnesses to testify against her of adultery;
and cited her and carried her before the King of the time who
adjudged her to be stoned. So they dug a pit, and seating her
therein stoned her, till she was covered with stones, and the
man said, “Be this hole her grave!” But when it was dark a
passer-by, making for a neighbouring hamlet, heard her groaning
in sore pain; and, pulling her out of the pit, carried her home to
his wife, whom he bade dress her wounds. The peasant woman
tended her till she recovered and presently gave her her child to be
nursed; and she used to lodge with the child in another house by
night. Now a certain thief saw her and lusted after her. So he
sent to her seeking her love-favours, but she denied herself to
him; wherefore he resolved to slay her and, making his way into
her lodging by night (and she sleeping), thought to strike at her
with a knife; but it smote the little one and killed it. Now when he
knew his misdeed, fear overtook him and he went forth the house
and Allah preserved from him her chastity. But as she awoke in
the morning, she found the child by her side with throat cut; and
presently the mother came and seeing her boy dead, said to the
nurse, “‘Twas thou didst murther him.” Therewith she beat her
a grievous beating and purposed to put her to death; but her
husband interposed and delivered the woman, saying, “By Allah,
thou shalt not do on this wise.” So the woman, who had somewhat
of money with her, fled forth for her life, knowing not whither she
should wend. Presently, she came to a village, where she saw a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>crowd of people about a man crucified to a tree-stump, but still in
the chains of life. “What hath he done?” she asked, and they
answered, “He hath committed a crime, which nothing can expiate
but death or the payment of such a fine by way of alms.” So she
said to them, “Take the money and let him go;” and, when they
did so, he repented at her hands and vowed to serve her, for the
love of Almighty Allah till death should release him. Then he
built her a cell and lodged her therein; after which he betook
himself to woodcutting and brought her daily her bread. As for
her, she was constant in worship, so that there came no sick man
or demoniac to her, but she prayed for him and he was straightway
healed.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
woman’s cell was visited by folk (and she constant in worship), it
befel by decree of the Almighty that He sent down upon her
husband’s brother (the same who had caused her to be stoned), a
cancer in the face, and smote the villager’s wife (the same who had
beaten her) with leprosy, and afflicted the thief (the same who had
murthered the child) with palsy. Now when the Kazi returned from
his pilgrimage, he asked his brother of his wife, and he told him that
she was dead, whereat he mourned sore and accounted her with her
Maker. After awhile, very many folk heard of the pious recluse
and flocked to her cell from all parts of the length and breadth of
the earth; whereupon said the Kazi to his brother, “O my brother,
wilt thou not seek out yonder pious woman? Haply Allah shall
decree thee healing at her hands!” and he replied, “O my brother,
carry me to her.” Moreover, the husband of the leprous woman
heard of the pious devotee and carried his wife to her, as did also
the people of the paralytic thief; and they all met at the door of
the hermitage. Now she had a place wherefrom she could look out
upon those who came to her, without their seeing her; and they
waited till her servant came, when they begged admittance and
obtained permission. Presently she saw them all and recognized
them; so she veiled and cloaked face and body and went out and
stood in the door, looking at her husband and his brother and the
thief and the peasant-woman; but they could not recognise her.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>Then said she to them, “Ho folk, ye shall not be relieved of what
is with you till ye confess your sins; for, when the creature confesseth
his sins the Creator relenteth towards him and granteth
him that wherefore he resorteth to Him.” Quoth the Kazi to his
brother, “O my brother, repent to Allah and persist not in thy
frowardness, for it will be more helpful to thy relief.” And the
tongue of the case spake this speech:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">This day oppressor and oppressèd meet, ✿ And Allah sheweth secrets we secrete:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">(Saith the relator), Then quoth the brother, “Now I will tell the
truth: I did thus and thus with thy wife;” and he confessed the
whole matter, adding, “And this is my offence.” Quoth the
leprous woman, “As for me, I had a woman with me and imputed
to her that of which I knew her to be guiltless, and beat her
grievously; and this is my offence.” And quoth the paralytic,
“And I went in to a woman to kill her, after I had tempted her to
commit adultery and she had refused; and I slew a child that lay
by her side; and this is my offence.” Then said the pious woman,
“O my God, even as Thou hast made them feel the misery of
revolt, so show them now the excellence of submission, for Thou
over all things art Omnipotent!” And Allah (to whom belong
Majesty and Might!) made them whole. Then the Kazi fell to
looking on her and considering her straitly, till she asked him why
he looked so hard and he said, “I had a wife and were she not
dead, I had said thou art she.” Hereupon, she made herself
known to him and both began praising Allah (to whom belong
Majesty and Might!) for that which He had vouchsafed them of
the reunion of their loves; but the brother and the thief and the
villager’s wife joined in imploring her forgiveness. So she forgave
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>them one and all, and they worshipped Allah in that place and
rendered her due service, till Death parted them. And one of the
Sayyids<a id="r466"></a><a href="#f466" class="c011"><sup>[466]</sup></a> hath related this tale of</p>

as opposed to the “Najib al-tarafayn,” when both parents are of Apostolic blood. The
distinction is not noticed in Lane’s “Modern Egyptians.” The Sharif is a fanatic and
often dangerous, as I have instanced in Pilgrimage iii. 132.</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 id="c259" class="c007">THE SHIPWRECKED WOMAN AND HER CHILD.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">I was circuiting the Ka’abah one dark night, when I heard a
plaintive voice, speaking from a contrite heart and saying, “O
Bountiful One, Thy past boon! Indeed, by my heart shall Thy
covenant never be undone.” Hearing this voice, my heart fluttered
so that I was like to die; but I followed the sound and behold, it
came from a woman, to whom I said, “Peace be with thee, O
handmaid of Allah;” whereto she replied, “And with thee be
peace, and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!” Quoth I, “I
conjure thee, by Allah the Most Great, tell me what is the covenant
to which thy heart is constant.” Quoth she, “But that thou
adjurest me by the Omnipotent, I would not tell thee my secrets.
See what is before me.” So I looked and lo! there was a child
lying asleep before her and breathing heavily in his slumber. Said
she, “Know, that I set forth, being big with this boy, to make
the pilgrimage to this House and took passage in a ship; but the
waves rose against us and the winds blew contrary and the vessel
broke up. I saved myself on a plank; and, on that bit of wood, I
gave birth to this child; and while he lay on my bosom and the
waves beating upon me,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the woman
continued, “Now while the boy lay on my bosom and the waves
<span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>beat upon me, there swam up to me one of the sailors, who climbed
on the plank and said:—By Allah, I desired thee whilst thou wast
yet in the ship, and now I have come at thee: so yield thy body
to me, or I will throw thee into the sea. Said I:—Out on thee!
hast thou no memory of that which thou hast seen and is it no
warning to thee? Quoth he:—I have seen the like of this many
a time and come off safe and care not. Quoth I:—O fellow, we
are now in a calamity, whence we hope to be delivered by obedience
to Allah and not by disobedience. But he persisted with
me, and I feared him and thought to put him off; so I said to
him:—Wait till this babe shall sleep; but he took the child off
my lap and threw him into the sea. Now when I saw this desperate
deed, my heart sank and sorrow was sore upon me; so I
raised my eyes heavenwards and said:—O Thou that interposest
between a man and his heart, intervene between me and this
leonine brute; for Thou over all things art Omnipotent! And by
Allah, hardly had I spoken when a beast rose out of the sea and
snatched him off the plank. When I saw myself alone my sorrows
redoubled and my grief and longing for my child, and I recited:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My coolth of eyes, the darling child of me ✿ Is lost, and racked my heart with agony;</div>
      <div class="line">My body wrecked, and red-hot coals of love ✿ Burning my liver with sore pangs, I see.</div>
      <div class="line">In this my sorrow shows no gleam of joy; ✿ Save Thy high grace and my expectancy:</div>
      <div class="line">Hast seen, O Lord, what unto me befel; ✿ My son aye lost and parting pangs I dree:</div>
      <div class="line">Take ruth on us and make us meet again; ✿ For now my stay and only hope’s in Thee!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">I abode in this condition a day and a night; and, when morning
dawned, I caught sight of the sails of a vessel shining afar off, nor
did the waves cease to drive me and the winds to waft me on, till
I reached the ship, whose sails I had sighted. The sailors took
me up and I looked and behold, my babe was amongst them: so
I threw myself upon him and said:—O folk, this is my child: how
and whence came ye by him? Quoth they:—Whilst we were
sailing along the seas the ship suddenly stood still and lo! that
which stayed us was a beast, as it were a great city, and this babe
on its back, sucking his thumbs. So we took him up. Now
when I heard this, I told them my tale and all that had betided
me and returned thanks to my Lord for His goodness, and vowed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>to Him that never, whilst I lived, would I stir from His House nor
swerve from His service; and since then I have never asked of
Him aught but He hath given it me.” Now when she had made
an end of her story (quoth the Sayyid), I put my hand to my
alms-pouch and would have given to her, but she exclaimed,
“Away from me, thou idle man! Have I not told thee of His
mercies and the graciousness of His dealings and shall I take an
alms from other than His hand?” And I could not prevail with
her to accept aught of me: so I left her and went away, reciting
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">How many boons conceals the Deity, ✿ Eluding human sight in mystery:</div>
      <div class="line">How many graces come on heels of stresses, ✿ And fill the burning heart with jubilee:</div>
      <div class="line">How many a sorrow in the morn appears, ✿ And turns at night-tide into gladdest gree:</div>
      <div class="line">If things go hard with thee some day, yet trust ✿ Th’ Eterne, th’ Almighty God of Unity:</div>
      <div class="line">And pray the Prophet that he intercede; ✿ Through intercession every wish shalt see.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And she left not the service of her Lord, cleaving unto His House,
till death came to her. And a tale is also told, by Málik bin

<p class="c012">We were once afflicted with drought at Bassorah and went forth
sundry times to pray for rain, but saw no sign of our prayers being
accepted. So I went, I and ‘Itaa al-Salamí and Sábit al-Banáni
and Naja al-Bakáa and Mohammed bin Wási’a and Ayyúb al-Sukhtiyáni
and Habíb al-Farsi and Hassán bin Abi Sinán and

rain, but saw no sign of acceptance. So about midday the people
went away and I and Sabit al-Banani tarried in the place of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>prayer till nightfall, when we saw a black of comely face, slender
of shank<a id="r470"></a><a href="#f470" class="c011"><sup>[470]</sup></a> and big of belly, approach us, clad in a pair of woollen
drawers; if all he wore had been priced, it would not have fetched
a couple of dirhams. He brought water and made the minor
ablution, then, going up to the prayer-niche, prayed two inclinations
deftly, his standing and bowing and prostration being
exactly similar in both. Then he raised his glance heavenwards,
and said, “O my God and my Lord and Master, how long wilt
Thou reject Thy servants in that which offereth no hurt to Thy
sovereignty? Is that which is with Thee wasted or are the treasuries
of Thy Kingdom annihilated? I conjure Thee, by Thy love to me
forthwith to pour out upon us Thy rain-clouds of grace!” He
spake and hardly had he made an end of speaking, when the
heavens clouded over and there came a rain, as if the mouths of
waterskins had been opened; and when we left the oratory, we
were knee-deep in water,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that hardly
had he spoken when the heavens clouded over and there came
a rain, as if the mouths of waterskins had been opened. And
when we left the oratory we were knee-deep in water, and we
were lost in wonder at the black. So I accosted him and said
to him, “Woe to thee, O black, art thou not ashamed of what
thou saidst?” He turned to me and asked, “What said I?”;
and I, “Thy saying to Allah:—By Thy love of me; and what
giveth thee to know that He loveth thee?” Replied he, “Away
from me, O thou distracted by the world from the care of thine
own soul. Where was I, when He gave me strength to profess
the unity of the Godhead and vouchsafed unto me the knowledge
of Him? How deemest thou that He aided me thus
except of His love to me?” adding, “Verily, His love to me is
after the measure of my love to Him.” Quoth I, “Tarry awhile
<span class="pageno" id="Page_262">262</span>with me, so may Allah have mercy on thee!” But he said, “I
am a chattel and the Book enjoineth me to obey my lesser
master.” So we followed him afar off, till we saw him enter
the house of a slave-broker. Now the first half of the night
was past and the last half was longsome upon us, so we went
away; but next morning, we repaired to the slave-dealer and said
to him, “Hast thou a lad to sell us for service?” He answered,
“Yes, I have an hundred lads or so and they are all for sale.”
Then he showed us slave after slave, till he had shown us some
seventy; but my friend was not amongst them, and the dealer
said, “These are all I have.” But, as we were going out from him
we saw a ruinous hut behind his house and going in behold, we
found the black standing there. I cried, “‘Tis he, by the Lord
of the Ka’abah!” and turning to the dealer, said to him, “Sell me
yonder slave.” Replied he, “O Abu Yahya, this is a pestilent
unprofitable fellow, who hath no concern by night but weeping
and by day but repentance.” I rejoined, “It is for that I want
him.” So the dealer called him, and he came out, showing drowsiness.
Quoth his master, “Take him at thine own price, so thou
hold me free of all his faults.” I bought him for twenty dinars
and asked “What is his name?” and the dealer answered,
“Maymún, the monkey;” and I took him by the hand and
went out with him, intending to go home; but he turned to me
and said, “O my lesser lord, why and wherefore didst thou buy
me? By Allah, I am not fit for the service of God’s creatures!”
Replied I, “I bought thee that I might serve thee myself; and
on my head be it.” Asked he, “Why so?” and I answered,
“Wast thou not in company with us yesterday in the place of
prayer?” Quoth he, “And didst thou hear me?”; and quoth I,
“It was I accosted thee yesterday and spoke with thee.” Thereupon
he advanced till we came to a mosque, where he entered and
prayed a two-bow prayer; after which he said, “O my God and
my Lord and Master, the secret that was between me and Thee
Thou hast discovered unto Thy creatures and hast brought me
to shame before the worldling. How then shall life be sweet
to me, now that other than Thou hath happened upon that which
is between Thee and me? I conjure Thee to take my soul to Thee
forthright.”<a id="r471"></a><a href="#f471" class="c011"><sup>[471]</sup></a> So saying, he prostrated himself, and I awaited
<span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>awhile without seeing him raise his head; so I shook him and
behold, he was indeed dead, the mercy of Almighty Allah be upon
him! I laid him out stretching his arms and legs and looked at
him, and lo! he was smiling. Moreover, whiteness had got the
better of blackness on his brow, and his face was radiant with
light like a young moon. As we wondered at his case, the door
opened and a young man came in to us and said, “Peace be with
you! May Allah make great our reward and yours for our brother
Maymun! Here is his shroud: wrap him in it.” So saying, he
gave us two robes, never had we seen the like of them, and we
shrouded him therein. And now his tomb is a place whither men
resort to pray for rain and ask their requirements of Allah (be He
extolled and exalted!); and how excellently well saith the poet
on this theme:</p>

<span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>light hours; and, at nightfall, the man went out into the streets
and highways seeking a buyer for what they had made. They
were wont to fast continually by day<a id="r475"></a><a href="#f475" class="c011"><sup>[475]</sup></a> and one morning they
arose, fasting, and worked at their craft till the light failed them,
when the man went forth, according to custom, to find purchasers
for his wares, and fared on till he came to the door of the house
of a certain man of wealth, one of the sons of this world, high
in rank and dignity. Now the tray-maker was fair of face and
comely of form, and the wife of the master of the house saw him
and fell in love with him and her heart inclined to him with exceeding
inclination; so, her husband being absent, she called her
handmaid and said to her, “Contrive to bring yonder man to us.”
Accordingly the maid went out to him and called him and
stopped him as though she would buy what he held in hand.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the maid-servant
went out to the man and asked him, “Come in; my lady
hath a mind to buy some of thy wares, after she hath tried them
and looked at them.” The man thought she spoke truly and,
seeing no harm in this, entered and sat down as she bade him;
and she shut the door upon him. Whereupon her mistress came
out of her room and, taking him by the gaberdine,<a id="r476"></a><a href="#f476" class="c011"><sup>[476]</sup></a> drew him
within and said, “How long shall I seek union of thee? Verily
my patience is at an end on thine account. See now, the place is
perfumed and provision prepared and the householder is absent
this night, and I give to thee my person without reserve, I whose
favours kings and captains and men of fortune have sought this
long while, but I have regarded none of them.” And she went
<span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>on talking thus to him, whilst he raised not his eyes from the
ground, for shame before Allah Almighty and fear of the pains
and penalties of His punishment; even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">‘Twixt me and riding many a noble dame, ✿ Was naught but shame which kept me chaste and pure:</div>
      <div class="line">My shame was cure to her; but haply were ✿ Shame to depart, she ne’er had known a cure.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The man strove to free himself from her, but could not; so he
said to her, “I want one thing of thee.” She asked, “What is
that?”: and he answered, “I wish for pure water and that I may
carry it to the highest place of thy house and do somewhat therewith
and cleanse myself of an impurity, which I may not disclose
to thee.” Quoth she, “The house is large and hath closets and
corners and privies at command.” But he replied, “I want
nothing but to be at a height.” So she said to her slave-girl,
“Carry him up to the belvedere on the house-terrace.” Accordingly
the maid took him up to the very top and, giving
him a vessel of water, went down and left him. Then he made
the ablution and prayed a two-bow prayer; after which he looked
at the ground, thinking to throw himself down, but seeing it afar
off, feared to be dashed to pieces by the fall.<a id="r477"></a><a href="#f477" class="c011"><sup>[477]</sup></a> Then he bethought
him of his disobedience to Allah, and the consequences of his sin;
so it became a light matter to him to offer up his life and shed his
blood; and he said, “O my God and my Lord, Thou seest that
which is fallen on me; neither is my case hidden from Thee.
Thou indeed over all things art Omnipotent and the tongue of
my case reciteth and saith:”—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">

      <div class="line">O Thou to whom no second be conjoined! ✿ A wretched lover seeks Thee in his woe.</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>Then the man cast himself down from the belvedere; but Allah
sent an angel who bore him up on his wings and brought him
down to the ground, whole and without hurt or harm. Now when
he found himself safe on the ground, he thanked and praised
Allah (to whom belong Majesty and Might!) for His merciful
protection of his person and his chastity; and he went straight to
his wife who had long expected him, and he empty-handed. Then
seeing him, she asked him why he had tarried and what was come
of that he had taken with him and why he returned empty-handed;
whereupon he told her of the temptation which had
befallen him, and she said, “Alhamdolillah—praised be God—for
delivering thee from seduction and intervening between thee and
such calamity!” Then she added, “O man, the neighbours use to
see us light our oven every night; and, if they see us fireless this
night, they will know that we are destitute. Now it behoveth in
gratitude to Allah, that we hide our destitution and conjoin the
fast of this night to that of the past and continue it for the sake of
Allah Almighty.” So she rose and, filling the oven with wood,
lighted it, to baffle the curiosity of her women-neighbours, reciting
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the
goodwife had lit the fire to baffle the curiosity of her women-neighbours,
she and her husband made the Wuzu-ablution and
stood up to pray, when behold, one of the neighbours’ wives came
and asked leave to take a fire-brand from the oven. “Do what
thou wilt with the oven,” answered they; but, when she came to
the fire, she cried out, saying, “Ho, such an one (to the tray-maker’s
wife) take up thy bread ere it burn!” Quoth the wife to
her husband, “Hearest thou what she saith?” Quoth he, “Go
<span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>and look.” So she went up to the oven, and behold, it was full of
fine bread and white. She took up the scones and carried them
to her husband, thanking Allah (to whom belong Majesty and
Might!) for His abounding good and great bounty; and they ate
of the bread and drank water and praised the Almighty. Then
said the woman to her husband, “Come let us pray to Allah the
Most Highest, so haply He may vouchsafe us what shall enable us
to dispense with the weariness of working for daily bread and
devote ourselves wholly to worshipping and obeying Him.” The
man rose in assent and prayed, whilst his wife said, “Amen,” to
his prayer, when the roof clove in sunder and down fell a ruby,
which lit the house with its light. Hereat, they redoubled in
praise and thanksgiving to Allah praying what the Almighty
willed,<a id="r478"></a><a href="#f478" class="c011"><sup>[478]</sup></a> and rejoiced at the ruby with great joy. And the night
being far spent, they lay down to sleep and the woman dreamt
that she entered Paradise and saw therein many chairs ranged and
stools set in rows. She asked what the seats were and it was
answered her, “These are the chairs of the prophets and those are
the stools of the righteous and the pious.” Quoth she, “Which is
the stool of my husband such an one?”; and it was said to her,
“It is this.” So she looked and seeing a hole in its side asked,
“What may be this hole?”; and the reply came, “It is the place
of the ruby that dropped upon you from your house-roof.” Thereupon
she awoke, weeping and bemoaning the defect in her
husband’s stool among the seats of the Righteous; so she told
him the dream and said to him, “Pray Allah, O man, that this
ruby return to its place; for endurance of hunger and poverty
during our few days here were easier than a hole in thy chair
among the just in Paradise.”<a id="r479"></a><a href="#f479" class="c011"><sup>[479]</sup></a> Accordingly, he prayed to his Lord,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>and lo! the ruby flew up to the roof and away whilst they looked
at it. And they ceased not from their poverty and their piety, till
they went to the presence of Allah, to whom be Honour and
Glory! And they also tell a tale of</p>

in a man who never wanted for anything. Here he is diametrically opposed to Ali who
honestly abused poverty; and the Prophet seems to have borrowed from Christendom,
whose “Lazarus and Dives” shows a man sent to Hell because he enjoyed a very
modified Heaven in this life and which suggested that one of the man’s greatest miseries
is an ecclesiastical virtue—“Holy Poverty”—represented in the Church as a bride young
and lovely. If a “rich man can hardly enter the kingdom” what must it be with a poor
man whose conditions are far more unfavourable? Going to the other extreme we may say
that Poverty is the root of all evil and the more so as it curtails man’s power of benefiting
others. Practically I observe that those who preach and praise it the most, practise it
the least willingly: the ecclesiastic has always some special reasons, a church or a school
is wanted; but not the less he wishes for more money. In Syria this Holy Poverty leads
to strange abuses. At Bayrut I recognised in most impudent beggars well-to-do peasants
from the Kasrawán district, and presently found out that whilst their fields were under
snow they came down to the coast, enjoyed a genial climate and lived on alms. When I
asked them if they were not ashamed to beg, they asked me if I was ashamed of following
in the footsteps of the Saviour and Apostles. How much wiser was Zoroaster who found
in the Supreme Paradise (Minuwán-minu) “many persons, rich in gold and silver who
had worshipped the Lord and had been grateful to Him.” (Dabistan i. 265.)</p>

<p class="c012">Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf al-Sakafi had been long in pursuit of
a certain man of the notables, and when at last he was brought
before him, he said, “O enemy of Allah, He hath delivered thee
over to me;” and cried, “Hale him to prison and lay him by the
heels in heavy fetters and build a closet over him, that he may not
come forth of it nor any go into him.” So they bore him to jail and
summoned the blacksmith with the irons; and every time the
smith gave a stroke with his hammer, the prisoner raised his eyes
to heaven and said, “Is not the whole Creation and the Empire
thereof His?”<a id="r480"></a><a href="#f480" class="c011"><sup>[480]</sup></a> Then the gaolers built the cage<a id="r481"></a><a href="#f481" class="c011"><sup>[481]</sup></a> over him and

entered into him and the tongue of his case recited in

him and went to his house; and on the morrow, when he came to
the prison, he found the fetters lying on the ground and the
prisoner gone; whereat he was affrighted and made sure of death.
So he returned to his place and bade his family farewell, after
which he took in his sleeve his shroud and the sweet herbs for his
corpse, and went in to Al-Hajjáj. And as he stood before the
presence, the Governor smelt the perfumes and asked, “What is
that?” when the gaoler answered, “O my lord, it is I who have

</div>

<p class="c012">It reached the ears of a certain pious man that there abode in
such a town a blacksmith, who could put his hand into the fire and
pull out the iron red-hot, without the flames doing him aught of
hurt.<a id="r482"></a><a href="#f482" class="c011"><sup>[482]</sup></a> So he set out for the town in question and asked for the
blacksmith; and, when the man was shown to him, he watched
him at work and saw him do as had been reported to him. He
waited till he had made an end of his day’s work; then, going up
to him, saluted him with the salam and said, “I would be thy
guest this night.” Replied the smith, “With gladness and goodly
gree!” and carried him to his place, where they supped together
and lay down to sleep. The guest watched, but saw no sign in
his host of praying through the night or of special devoutness and
said in his mind, “Haply he hideth himself from me.” So he
lodged with him a second and a third night, but found that he did
not exceed the devotions prescribed by the law and custom of the
Prophet and rose but little in the dark hours to pray. At last he
said to him, “O my brother, I have heard of the gift with which
Allah hath favoured thee and have seen the truth of it with mine
eyes. Moreover, I have taken note of thine assiduity in religious
exercises, but find in thee no such piety as distinguisheth those
who work saintly miracles: whence, then, cometh this to thee?”
“I will tell thee,” answered the smith:—Know that I was once
passionately enamoured of a slave-girl and ofttimes sued her for
love-liesse, but could not prevail upon her, because she still held fast
by her chastity. Presently there came a year of drought and hunger
and hardship; food failed and there befel a sore famine. As I
was sitting one day at home, somebody knocked at the door; so
I went out and behold, she was standing there; and she said to
me, “O my brother, I am sorely anhungered and I lift mine eyes
to thee, beseeching thee to feed me for Allah’s sake!” Quoth I,
“Wottest thou not how I love thee and what I have suffered for
thy sake? Now I will not give thee one bittock of bread except
<span class="pageno" id="Page_271">271</span>thou yield thy person to me.” Quoth she, “Death, but not disobedience
to the Lord!” Then she went away and returned after
two days with the same prayer for food as before. I made her a
like answer, and she entered and sat down in my house being nigh
upon death. I set food before her, whereupon her eyes brimmed
with tears and she cried, “Give me meat for the love of Allah, to
whom belong Honour and Glory!” But I answered, “Not so, by
Allah, except thou yield thyself to me.” Quoth she, “Better is
death to me than the wrath and wreak of Allah the Most Highest;”
and she rose and left the food untouched——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
man set food before her, the woman said, “Give me meat for the
love of Allah, to whom be Honour and Glory!” But I answered,
“Not so, by Allah, except thou yield to me thy person.” Quoth
she, “Better is death than the wrath and wreak of Allah;” and she
rose and left the food untouched and went away repeating these

</div>

<p class="c000">She then disappeared for two days, when she again came and
knocked at the door; so I went out to her, and lo! hunger had
taken away her voice; but, after a rest she said, “O my brother, I
am worn out with want and know not what to do, for I cannot
show my face to any man but to thee. Say, wilt thou feed me for
the love of Allah Almighty?” But I answered, “Not so, except
thou yield to me thy person.” And she entered my house and sat
down. Now I had no food ready; but, when the meat was dressed
and I laid it in a saucer, behold, the grace of Almighty Allah
entered into me and I said to myself, “Out on thee! This woman,
weak of wit and faith, hath refrained from food till she can no
<span class="pageno" id="Page_272">272</span>longer, for stress of hunger; and, while she refuseth time after time,
thou canst not forbear from disobedience to the Lord!” And I
said, “O my God, I repent to Thee of that which my flesh
purposed!” Then I took the food and carrying it to her, said,
“Eat, for no harm shall betide thee: this is for the love of Allah,
to whom belong Honour and Glory!” Then she raised her eyes
to heaven and said, “O my God, if this man say sooth, I pray Thee
forbid fire to harm him in this world and the next, for Thou over
all things art Omnipotent and Prevalent in answering the prayer
of the penitent!” Then I left her and went to put out the fire in
the brasier.<a id="r483"></a><a href="#f483" class="c011"><sup>[483]</sup></a> Now the season was winter and the weather cold,
and a live coal fell on my body: but by the decree of Allah (to
whom be Honour and Glory!) I felt no pain and it became my
conviction that her prayer had been answered. So I took the coal
in my hand, and it burnt me not; and going in to her, I said,
“Be of good cheer, for Allah hath granted thy prayer!”——And

  <h2 id="c274" class="c007">THE DEVOTEE TO WHOM ALLAH GAVE A CLOUD FOR SERVICE AND THE DEVOUT KING.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, among the children of Israel, a man of the
devout, for piety acclaimed and for continence and asceticism
en-famed, whose prayers were ever granted and who by supplication
obtained whatso he wanted; and he was a wanderer in the
mountains and was used to pass the night in worship. Now
Almighty Allah had subjected to him a cloud which travelled
with him wherever he went, and poured on him its water-treasures
in abundance that he might make his ablutions and
drink. After a long time when things were thus, his fervour somewhat
abated, whereupon Allah took the cloud away from him and
ceased to answer his prayers. On this account, great was his grief
and long was his woe, and he ceased not to regret the time of grace
and the miracle vouchsafed to him and to lament and bewail and
bemoan himself, till he saw in a dream one who said to him, “An
thou wouldest have Allah restore to thee thy cloud, seek out a
certain King, in such a town, and beg him to pray for thee: so
will Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) give thee back thy cloud
and bespread it over thee by virtue of his pious prayers.” And he
began repeating these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Wend to that pious prayerful Emir, ✿ Who can with gladness thy condition cheer;</div>
      <div class="line">An he pray Allah, thou shalt win thy wish; ✿ And heavy rain shall drop from welkin clear.</div>
      <div class="line">He stands all Kings above in potent worth; ✿ Nor to compare with him doth aught appear:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>Near him thou soon shalt hap upon thy want, ✿ And see all joy and gladness draw thee near:</div>
      <div class="line">Then cut the wolds and wilds unfounted till ✿ The goal thou goest for anigh shalt speer!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So the hermit set out for the town named to him in the dream;
and, coming thither after long travel, enquired for the King’s
palace which was duly shown to him. And behold, at the gate
he found a slave-officer sitting on a great chair and clad in gorgeous
gear; so he stood to him and saluted him; and he returned
his salam and asked him, “What is thy business?” Answered
the devotee, “I am a wronged man, and come to submit my case
to the King.” Quoth the officer, “Thou hast no access to him
this day; for he hath appointed unto petitioners and enquirers one
day in every seven” (naming the day), “on which they may go in
to him; so wend thy ways in welfare till then.” The hermit was
vexed with the King for thus veiling himself from the folk and said
in thought, “How shall this man be a saint of the saints of Allah
(to whom belong Majesty and Might!) and he on this wise?”
Then he went away and awaited the appointed day. Now (quoth
he) when it came, I repaired to the palace, where I found a great
number of folk at the gate, expecting admission; and I stood with
them, till there came out a Wazir robed in gorgeous raiment and
attended by guards and slaves, who said, “Let those, who have
petitions to present, enter.” So I entered with the rest and found
the King seated facing his officers and grandees who were ranged
according to their several ranks and degrees. The Wazir took up
his post and brought forward the petitioners, one by one, till it
came to my turn, when the King looked on me and said, “Welcome
to the ‘Lord of the Cloud’! Sit thee down till I make
leisure for thee.” I was confounded at his words and confessed
his dignity and superiority; and, when the King had answered
the petitioners and had made an end with them, he rose and dismissed
his Wazirs and Grandees; then, taking my hand he led
me to the door of the private palace, where we found a black slave,
splendidly arrayed, with helm on head, and on his right hand and
his left, bows and coats of mail. He rose to the King; and,
hastening to obey his orders and forestall his wishes, opened the
door. We went in, hand in hand, till we came to a low wicket,
which the King himself opened and led me into a ruinous place of
frightful desolation and thence passed into a chamber, wherein was
naught but a prayer-carpet, an ewer for ablution and some mats of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>palm-leaves. Here the King doffed his royal robes and donned a
coarse gown of white wool and a conical bonnet of felt. Then he
sat down and making me sit, called out to his wife, “Ho, such
an one!” and she answered from within saying, “Here am I.”
Quoth he, “Knowest thou who is our guest to-day?” Replied
she, “Yes, it is the ‘Lord of the Cloud.’” The King said, “Come
forth: it mattereth not for him.” And behold, there entered a
woman, as she were a vision, with a face that beamed like the new
moon; and she wore a gown and veil of wool.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
King called to his wife, she came forth from the inner room; and
her face beamed like the new moon; and she wore a gown and a
veil of wool. Then said the King, “O my brother, dost thou desire
to hear our story or that we should pray for thee and dismiss thee?”
Answered the hermit; “Nay, I wish to hear the tale of you twain,
for that to me were preferable.” Said the King, “My forefathers
handed down the throne, one to the other, and it descended from
great one to great one, in unbroken succession, till the last died
and it came to me. Now Allah had made this hateful to me, for I
would fain have gone awandering over earth and left the folk to
their own affairs; but I feared lest they should fall into confusion
and anarchy and misgovernment so as to swerve from divine law,
and the union of the Faith be broken up. Wherefore, abandoning
my own plans, I took the kingship and appointed to every head of
them a regular stipend; and donned the royal robes; and posted
slave-officers at the doors, as a terror to the dishonest and for the
defence of honest folk and the maintenance of law and limitations.
Now when free of this, I entered this place and, doffing my royal
habit, donned these clothes thou seest; and this my cousin, the
daughter of my father’s brother, hath agreed with me to renounce
the world and helpeth me to serve the Lord. So we are wont to
weave these palm-leaves and earn, during the day, a wherewithal
to break our fast at nightfall; and we have lived on this wise nigh
upon forty years. Abide thou with us (so Allah have mercy on
thee!) till we sell our mats; and thou shalt sup and sleep with us
this night and on the morrow wend thy ways with that thou wishest,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_276">276</span>Inshallah!” So he tarried with them till the end of the day, when
there came a boy five years old who took the mats they had made
and carrying them to the market, sold them for a carat;<a id="r484"></a><a href="#f484" class="c011"><sup>[484]</sup></a> and with
this bought bread and beans and returned with them to the King.
The hermit broke his fast and lay down to sleep with them; but
in the middle of the night, they both arose and fell to praying and
weeping. When daybreak was near, the King said, “O my God,
this Thy servant beseecheth Thee to return him his cloud; and to
do this Thou art able; so, O my God, let him see his prayer granted
and restore him his cloud.” The Queen amen’d to his orisons and
behold, the cloud grew up in the sky; whereupon the King gave
the hermit joy and the man took leave of them and went away, the
cloud companying him as of old. And whatsoever he required of
Allah after this, in the names of the pious King and Queen, He
granted it without fail and the man made thereon these couplets:—</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 id="c277" class="c007">THE MOSLEM CHAMPION AND THE CHRISTIAN DAMSEL.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">The Commander of the Faithful, Omar bin al-Khattáb (whom
Allah accept!), once levied for holy war an army of Moslems, to
encounter the foe before Damascus, and they laid close siege to
one of the Christians’ strongholds. Now there were amongst the
Moslems two men, brothers, whom Allah had gifted with fire and
bold daring against the enemy; so that the commander of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_277">277</span>besieged fortress said to his chiefs and braves, “Were but yonder
two Moslems ta’en or slain, I would warrant you against the rest
of their strain.” Wherefore they left not to set for them all
manner of toils and snares and ceased not to manœuvre and lie
in wait and ambush for them, till they took one of them prisoner
and slew the other who died a martyr. They carried the captive
to the Captain of the fort, who looked at him and said, “Verily,
to kill this man were indeed a pity; but his return to the Moslem
would be a calamity.”—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
enemy carried their Moslem captive before the Captain of the fort,
the Christian looked at him and said, “Verily to kill this man
were a pity indeed; but his return to the Moslem would be a
calamity. Oh that he might be brought to embrace the Nazarene
Faith and be to us an aid and an arm!” Quoth one of his
Patrician Knights, “O Emir, I will tempt him to abjure his faith
and on this wise: we know that the Arabs are much addicted to
women, and I have a daughter, a perfect beauty, whom when he
sees, he will be seduced by her.” Quoth the Captain, “I give him
into thy charge.” So he carried him to his place and clad his
daughter in raiment, such as added to her beauty and loveliness.
Then he brought the Moslem into the room and set before him
food and made the fair girl stand in his presence, as she were a
handmaid obedient to her lord and awaiting his orders that she
might do his bidding. When the Moslem saw the evil sent down
upon him, he commended himself to Allah Almighty and closing
his eyes, applied himself to worship and to reciting the Koran.
Now he had a pleasant voice and a piercing wit; and the Nazarene
damsel presently loved him with passionate love and pined for
him with extreme repine. This lasted seven days, at the end of
which she said to herself, “Would to Heaven he would admit me
into the Faith of Al-Islam!” And the tongue of her case recited
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Wilt turn thy face from heart that’s all thine own, ✿ This heart thy ransom and this soul thy wone?</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_278">278</span>I’m ready home and kin to quit for aye, ✿ And every Faith for that of sword<a id="r485"></a><a href="#f485" class="c011"><sup>[485]</sup></a> disown:</div>
      <div class="line">I testify that Allah hath no mate: ✿ This proof is stablished and this truth is known.</div>
      <div class="line">Haply shall deign He union grant with one ✿ Averse, and hearten heart love-overthrown;</div>
      <div class="line">For ofttimes door erst shut, is opened wide, ✿ And after evil case all good is shown.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">At last her patience failed her and her breast was straitened and
she threw herself on the ground before him, saying, “I conjure thee
by thy Faith, that thou give ear to my words!” Asked he, “What
are they?” and she answered, “Expound unto me Al-Islam.” So
he expounded to her the tenets of the Faith, and she became a
Moslemah, after which she was circumcised<a id="r486"></a><a href="#f486" class="c011"><sup>[486]</sup></a> and he taught her to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>pray. Then said she to him, “O my brother, I did but embrace
Al-Islam for thy sake and to win thy favours.” Quoth he, “The
law of Al-Islam forbiddeth sexual commerce save after a marriage
before two legal witnesses, and a dowry and a guardian are also
requisite. Now I know not where to find witnesses or friend or
parapherne; but, an thou can contrive to bring us out of this
place, I may hope to make the land of Al-Islam, and pledge
myself to thee that none other than thou in all Al-Islam shall be
wife to me.” Answered she, “I will manage that”; and, calling her
father and mother, said to them, “Indeed this Moslem’s heart is
softened and he longeth to enter the faith, so I will grant him that
which he desireth of my person; but he saith:—It befitteth me not
to do this in a town where my brother was slain. Could I but get
outside it my heart would be solaced and I would do that which
is wanted of me. Now there is no harm in letting me go forth
with him to another town, and I will be a surety to you both and
to the Emir for that which ye wish of him.” Therefore her father
went to their Captain and told him this, whereat he joyed with
exceeding joy and bade him carry them forth to a village that she
named. So they went out and made the village where they abode
the rest of their day, and when night fell, they got ready for the
march and went their way, even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The time of parting,” cry they, “draweth nigh”: ✿ “How oft this parting-threat?” I but reply:</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve naught to do but cross the wild and wold ✿ And, mile by mile, o’er fount-less wastes to fly,</div>
      <div class="line">If the belovèd seek another land ✿ Sons of the road, whereso they wend, wend I.</div>
      <div class="line">I make desire direct me to their side, ✿ The guide to show me where the way doth lie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
prisoner and the lady abode in the village the rest of their day
and, when night fell, made ready for the march and went upon
their way; and travelled all night without stay or delay. The
<span class="pageno" id="Page_280">280</span>young Moslem, mounting a swift blood-horse and taking up the
maiden behind him, ceased not devouring the ground till it was
bright morning, when he turned aside with her from the highway
and, alighting, they made the Wuzu-ablution and prayed the dawn-prayer.
Now as they were thus engaged behold, they heard the
clank of swords and clink of bridles and men’s voices and tramp
of horse; whereupon he said to her, “Ho, such an one, the
Nazarenes are after us! What shall we do?: the horse is so jaded
and broken down that he cannot stir another step.” Exclaimed
she, “Woe to thee! art thou then afraid and affrighted?” “Yes,”
answered he; and she said, “What didst thou tell me of the
power of thy Lord and His readiness to succour those who succour
seek? Come, let us humble ourselves before Him and beseech
Him: haply He shall grant us His succour and endue us with His
grace, extolled and exalted be He!” Quoth he, “By Allah, thou
sayst well!” So they began humbling themselves and supplicating
Almighty Allah and he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed I hourly need thy choicest aid, ✿ And should, though crown were placed upon my head:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art my chiefest want, and if my hand ✿ Won what it wisheth, all my wants were sped.</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast not anything withholdest Thou; ✿ Like pouring rain Thy grace is showerèd:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m shut therefrom by sins of me, yet Thou, ✿ O Clement, deignest pardon-light to shed.</div>
      <div class="line">O Care-Dispeller, deign dispel my grief! ✿ None can, save Thou, dispel a grief so dread.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whilst he was praying and she was saying, “Amen,” and the
thunder of horse-tramp nearing them, lo! the brave heard the
voice of his dead brother, the martyr, speaking and saying, “O my
brother, fear not, nor grieve! for the host whose approach thou
hearest is the host of Allah and his Angels, whom He hath sent
to serve as witnesses to your marriage. Of a truth Allah hath
made His Angels glorify you and He bestoweth on you the meed
of the meritorious and the martyrs; and He hath rolled up the
earth for you as it were a rug so that, by morning, you will be in
the mountains of Al-Medinah. And thou, when thou foregatherest
with Omar bin al-Khattab (of whom Allah accept!) give him my
salutation and say to him:—Allah abundantly requite thee for Al-Islam,
because thou hast counselled faithfully and hast striven diligently.”
Thereupon the Angels lifted up their voices in salutation
<span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>to him and his bride, saying, “Verily, Almighty Allah appointed
her in marriage to thee two thousand years before the creation of
your father Adam (with whom be peace evermore!).” Then joy
and gladness and peace and happiness came upon the twain; confidence
was confirmed and established was the guidance of the
pious pair. So when dawn appeared, they prayed the accustomed
prayer and fared forward. Now it was the wont of Omar son
of Al-Khattab (Allah accept him!) to rise for morning-prayer
in the darkness before dawn and at times he would stand in the
prayer-niche with two men behind him, and begin reciting the
Chapter entitled “Cattle”<a id="r487"></a><a href="#f487" class="c011"><sup>[487]</sup></a> or that entitled Women;<a id="r488"></a><a href="#f488" class="c011"><sup>[488]</sup></a> whereupon
the sleeper awoke and he who was making his Wuzu-ablution
accomplished it and he who was afar came to prayer; nor had he
made an end of the first bow, ere the mosque was full of folk;
then he would pray his second bow quickly, repeating a short
chapter. But, on that morning he hurried over both first and
second inclinations, repeating in each a short chapter; then, after
the concluding salutation, turning to his companions, he said to
them, “Come, let us fare forth to meet the bride and bridegroom”;
at which they wondered, not understanding his words. But he
went out and they followed him, till they came to the gate of the
city, where they met the young Moslem who, when the day broke
and the standards of Al-Medinah appeared to him, had pushed
forward for the gate closely followed by his bride. There he was
met by Omar who bade make a marriage-feast; and the Moslems
came and ate. Then the young Moslem went in unto his bride
and Almighty Allah vouchsafed him children,——And Shahrazad,
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Omar (on
whom be peace!) bade make a marriage-feast; and the Moslems
came and ate. Then the young Moslem went in unto his bride
and Almighty Allah vouchsafed him children, who fought in the
Lord’s way and preserved genealogies, for they gloried therein.
And how excellent is what is said on such theme:—</p>

<p class="c000">And they ceased not to be in all solace and delight of life, till
there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of

</div>

<div class="footnote" id="f486">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r486">486</a>.  </span>Moslems like the Classics (Aristotle and others) hold the clitoris (<em>Zambúr</em>) to be the
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedes et scaturigo veneris</span> which, says Sonnini, is mere profanity. In the babe it protrudes
beyond the labiæ and snipping off the head forms female circumcision. This rite
is supposed by Moslems to have been invented by Sarah who so mutilated Hagar for
jealousy and was afterwards ordered by Allah to have herself circumcised at the same
time as Abraham. It is now (or should be) universal in Al-Islam and no Arab would
marry a girl “unpurified” by it. Son of an “uncircumcised” mother (Ibn al-bazrá) is
a sore insult. As regards the popular idea that Jewish women were circumcised till the
days of Rabbi Gershom (A.D. 1000) who denounced it as a scandal to the Gentiles, the
learned Prof. H. Graetz informs me, with some indignation, that the rite was never
practised and that the great Rabbi contended only against polygamy. Female circumcision,
however, is I believe the rule amongst some outlying tribes of Jews. The rite is
the proper complement of male circumcision, evening the sensitiveness of the genitories
by reducing it equally in both sexes: an uncircumcised woman has the venereal orgasm
much sooner and oftener than a circumcised man, and frequent coitus would injure her
health; hence I believe, despite the learned historian, that it is practised by some
Eastern Jews. “Excision” is universal amongst the negroids of the Upper Nile
(Werne), the Somál and other adjacent tribes. The operator, an old woman, takes
up the instrument, a knife or razor-blade fixed into a wooden handle, and with three
sweeps cuts off the labia and the head of the clitoris. The parts are then sewn up with
a pack-needle and a thread of sheepskin; and in Dar-For a tin tube is inserted for the
passage of urine. Before marriage the bridegroom trains himself for a month on beef,
honey and milk; and, if he can open his bride with the natural weapon, he is a sworder
to whom no woman in the tribe can deny herself. If he fail, he tries penetration with
his fingers and by way of last resort whips out his whittle and cuts the parts open. The
sufferings of the first few nights must be severe. The few Somáli prostitutes who
practised at Aden always had the labiæ and clitoris excised and the skin showing the
scars of coarse sewing. The moral effect of female circumcision is peculiar. While it
diminishes the heat of passion it increases licentiousness, and breeds a debauchery of
mind far worse than bodily unchastity, because accompanied by a peculiar cold cruelty
and a taste for artificial stimulants to “luxury.” It is the sexlessness of a spayed canine
imitated by the suggestive brain of humanity.</p>

  <h2 id="c283" class="c007">THE CHRISTIAN KING’S DAUGHTER AND THE MOSLEM.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">My spirit urged me, once upon a time, to go forth into the
country of the Infidels; and I strove with it and struggled
to put away from me this inclination; but it would not be rejected.
So I fared forth and journeyed about the land of the
Unbelievers and traversed it in all its parts; for divine grace
enveloped me and heavenly protection encompassed me, so that
I met not a single Nazarene but he turned away his eyes and
drew off from me, till I came to a certain great city at whose
gate I found a gathering of black slaves, clad in armour and
bearing iron maces in their hands. When they saw me, they
rose to their feet and asked me, “Art thou a leach?”; and I
answered, “Yes.” Quoth they, “Come speak to our King,” and
carried me before their ruler, who was a handsome personage of
majestic presence. When I stood before him, he looked at me and
said, “Art a physician, thou?” “Yes,” quoth I; and quoth he to his
officers, “Carry him to her, and acquaint him with the condition
<span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>before he enter.” So they took me out and said to me, “Know that
the King hath a daughter, and she is stricken with a sore disease,
which no doctor hath been able to cure: and no leach goeth in to
her and treateth, without healing her, but the King putteth him to
death. So bethink thee what thou seest fitting to do.” I replied,
“The King drove me to her; so carry me to her.” Thereupon
they brought me to her door and knocked; and behold, I heard
her cry out from within, saying, “Admit to me the physician, lord
of the wondrous secret!” And she began reciting:</p>

<p class="c000">And lo! a Shaykh, a very old man, opened the door in haste and
said to me, “Enter.” So I entered and found myself in a chamber
strewn with sweet-scented herbs and with a curtain drawn across
one corner, from behind which came a sound of groaning and
grame, weak as from an emaciated frame. I sat down before the
curtain and was about to offer my salam when I bethought me of
his words (whom Allah save and assain!), “Accost not a Jew nor a
Christian with the salam salutation;<a id="r492"></a><a href="#f492" class="c011"><sup>[492]</sup></a> and, when ye meet them in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>the way, constrain them to the straitest part thereof.” So I withheld
my salutation, but she cried out from behind the curtain,
saying, “Where is the salutation of Unity and Indivisibility, O
Khawwás?” I was astonished at her speech and asked, “How
knowest thou me?”; whereto she answered, “When the heart and
thoughts are whole, the tongue speaketh eloquently from the secret
recesses of the soul. I begged Him yesterday to send me one of
His saints, at whose hands I might have deliverance, and behold, it
was cried to me from the dark places of my house:—Grieve not; for
we soon will send thee Ibrahim the Basket-maker.” Then I asked
her, “What of thee?” and she answered, “It is now four years
since there appeared to me the Manifest Truth, and He is the
Relator and the Ally, and the Uniter and the Sitter-by; whereupon
my folk looked askance upon me with an evil eye and taxed me
with insanity and suspected me of depravity, and there came not
in to me doctor but terrified me, nor visitor but confounded me.”
Quoth I, “And who led thee to the knowledge of what thou
wottest?” Quoth she, “The manifest signs and visible portents of
Allah; and, when the path is patent to thee, thou espiest with thine
own eyes both proof and prover.” Now whilst we were talking,
behold, in came the old man appointed to guard her and said,
“What doth thy doctor?”; and she replied, “He knoweth the hurt
and hath hit upon the healing.”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Shaykh, her guardian, went in to her he said, “What doth thy
doctor?”; and she replied, “He knoweth the hurt and hath hit
upon the healing.” Hereupon he manifested joy and gladness and
accosted me with a cheerful countenance, then went and told the
King, who enjoined to treat me with all honour and regard. So I
visited her daily for seven days, at the end of which time she said
to me, “O Abú Ishák, when shall be our flight to the land of
Al-Islam?” “How canst thou go forth,” replied I, “and who
would dare to aid thee?” Rejoined she, “He who sent thee to
me, driving thee as it were;” and I observed, “Thou sayest sooth.”
So when the morrow dawned, we fared forth by the city-gate and
all eyes were veiled from us, by commandment of Him who when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_285">285</span>He desireth aught, saith to it, “Be,” and it becometh;<a id="r493"></a><a href="#f493" class="c011"><sup>[493]</sup></a> so that I
journeyed with her in safety to Meccah, where she made a home
hard by the Holy House of Allah and lived seven years; till the
appointed day of her death. The earth of Meccah was her tomb,
and never saw I any more steadfast in prayer and fasting than
she, Allah send down upon her His mercies and have compassion

  <h2 id="c286" class="c007">THE PROPHET AND THE JUSTICE OF PROVIDENCE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">A certain Prophet<a id="r494"></a><a href="#f494" class="c011"><sup>[494]</sup></a> made his home for worship on a lofty mountain,
at whose foot was a spring of running water, and he was wont
to sit by day on the summit, that no man might see him, calling
upon the name of Allah the Most Highest and watching those who
frequented the spring. One day, as he sat looking upon the fountain,
behold, he espied a horseman who came up and dismounted
thereby and taking a bag from his neck, set it down beside him,
after which he drank of the water and rested awhile, then he rode
away, leaving behind him the bag which contained gold pieces.
Presently up came another man to drink of the spring, who saw
<span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>the bag and finding it full of money took it up; then, after satisfying
his thirst, he made off with it in safety. A little after came a
wood-cutter wight with a heavy load of fuel on his back, and sat
down by the spring to drink, when lo! back came the first horseman
in great trouble and asked him, “Where is the bag which was
here?” and when he answered, “I know nothing of it,” the rider
drew his sword and smote him and slew him. Then he searched
his clothes, but found naught; so he left him and wended his ways.
Now when the Prophet saw this, he said, “O Lord, one man hath
taken a thousand dinars and another man hath been slain unjustly.”
But Allah answered him, saying, “Busy thyself with thy
devotions, for the ordinance of the universe is none of thine affair.
The father of this horseman had violently despoiled of a thousand
dinars the father of the second horseman; so I gave the son possession
of his sire’s money. As for the wood-cutter, he had slain
the horseman’s father, wherefore I enabled the son to obtain retribution
for himself.” Then cried the Prophet, “There is none other
god than Thou! Glory be to Thee only! Verily, Thou art the
Knower of Secrets.”<a id="r495"></a><a href="#f495" class="c011"><sup>[495]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of

  <h2 id="c288" class="c007">THE FERRYMAN OF THE NILE AND THE HERMIT.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">I was once a ferryman on the Nile and used to ply between the
eastern and the western banks. Now one day, as I sat in my
boat, there came up to me an old man of a bright and beaming
countenance, who saluted me and I returned his greeting; and
he said to me, “Wilt thou ferry me over for the love of Allah
Almighty?” I answered, “Yes,” and he continued, “Wilt thou
moreover give me food for Allah’s sake?”; to which again I
answered, “With all my heart.” So he entered the boat and I
rowed him over to the eastern side, remarking that he was clad
in a patched gown and carried a gourd-bottle and a staff. When
he was about to land, he said to me, “I desire to lay on thee a
heavy trust.” Quoth I, “What is it?” Quoth he, “It hath been
revealed to me that my end is nearhand and that to-morrow about
noon thou wilt come and find me dead under yonder tree. Wash
me and wrap me in the shroud thou wilt see under my head and
after thou hast prayed over me, bury me in this sandy ground and
take my gown and gourd and staff, which do thou deliver to one
who shall come and demand them of thee.” I marvelled at his
words, and I slept there. On the morrow I awaited till noon the
event he had announced, and then I forgot what he had said till
near the hour of afternoon-prayer, when I remembered it and
hastening to the appointed place, found him under the tree, dead,
with a new shroud under his head, exhaling a fragrance of musk.
So I washed him and shrouded him and prayed over him, then
dug a hole in the sand and buried him, after I had taken his
ragged gown and bottle and staff, with which I crossed the Nile
<span class="pageno" id="Page_288">288</span>to the western side and there nighted. As soon as morning
dawned and the city gate opened, I sighted a young man known to
me as a loose fellow, clad in fine clothes and his hands stained
with Henna, who said to me, “Art thou not such an one?”
“Yes,” answered I; and he said, “Give me the trust.” Quoth I,
“What is that?” Quoth he, “The gown, the gourd and the
staff.” I asked him, “Who told thee of them?” and he answered,
“I know nothing save that I spent yesternight at the wedding of
one of my friends singing and carousing till daylight, when I lay me
down to sleep and take my rest; and behold, there stood by me a
personage who said, “Verily Allah Almighty hath taken such a
saint to Himself and hath appointed thee to fill his place; so go
thou to a certain person (naming the ferryman), and take of him
the dead man’s gown and bottle and staff, for he left them with
him for thee.”” So I brought them out and gave them to him;
whereupon he doffed his clothes and, donning the gown, went his
way and left me.<a id="r497"></a><a href="#f497" class="c011"><sup>[497]</sup></a> And when the glooms closed around me, I fell
a-weeping; but, that night, while sleeping I saw the Lord of Holiness
(glorified and exalted be He!) in a dream saying, “O my
servant, is it grievous to thee that I have granted to one of My
servants to return to Me? Indeed, this is of My bounty, that I
vouchsafe to whom I will, for I over all things am Almighty.” So
I repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <h2 id="c290" class="c007">THE ISLAND KING AND THE PIOUS ISRAELITE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once a notable of the Children of Israel, a man of
wealth who had a pious and blessed son. When his last hour
drew nigh, his son sat down at his head and said to him, “O my
lord, give me an injunction.” Quoth the father, “O dear son, I
charge thee, swear not by Allah or truly or falsely.” Then he died
and certain lewd fellows of the Children of Israel heard of the
charge he had laid on his son and began coming to the latter and
saying, “Thy father had such and such monies of mine, and thou
knowest it; so give me what was entrusted to him or else make
oath that there was no trust.” The good son would not disobey
his sire’s injunction, so gave them all they claimed; and they
ceased not to deal thus with him, till his wealth was spent and
he fell into straitest predicament. Now the young man had a
pious and blessed wife, who had borne him two little sons; so he
said to her, “The folk have multiplied their demands on me and,
while I had the wherewithal to free myself of debt, I rendered it
freely; but naught is now left us, and if others make demands
upon me, we shall be in absolute distress, I and thou; our best
way were to save ourselves by fleeing to some place, where none
knoweth us, and earn our bread among the lower of the folk.”
Accordingly, he took ship with her and his two children, knowing
not whither he should wend; but, “When Allah judgeth, there is
none to reverse His judgment;”<a id="r499"></a><a href="#f499" class="c011"><sup>[499]</sup></a> and quoth the tongue of the
case:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

      <div class="line">O flier from thy home when foes affright! ✿ Whom led to weal and happiness such flight,</div>

      <div class="line">An pearls for ever did abide in shell, ✿ The kingly crown they ne’er had deckt and dight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_290">290</span>The ship was wrecked, yet the man saved himself on a plank and
his wife and children also saved themselves, but on other planks.
The waves separated them and the wife was cast up in one country
and one of the boys in another. The second son was picked up
by a ship, and the surges threw the father on a desert island, where
he landed and made the Wuzu-ablution. Then he called the
prayer-call——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
man landed upon the island, he made the Wuzu-ablution to free
himself from the impurities of the sea and called the call to prayer
and stood up to his devotions, when, behold, there came forth of
the sea creatures of various kinds and prayed with him. When he
had finished, he went up to a tree and stayed his hunger with its
fruits; after which he found a spring of water and drank thereof
and praised Allah, to whom be honour and glory! He abode thus
three days and whenever he stood up to pray, the sea-creatures
came out and prayed in the same manner as he prayed. Now
after the third day, he heard a voice crying aloud and saying, “O
thou just man, and pious, who didst so honour thy father and
revere the decrees of thy Lord, grieve not, for Allah (be He extolled
and exalted!) shall restore to thee all which left thy hand. In this
isle are hoards and monies and things of price which the Almighty
willeth thou shalt inherit, and they are in such a part of this place.
So bring thou them to light; and verily, we will send ships unto
thee; and do thou bestow charity on the folk and bid them to
thee.” So he sought out that place, and the Lord discovered to
him the treasures in question. Then ships began resorting to him,
and he gave abundant largesse to the crews, saying to them, “Be
sure ye direct the folk unto me and I will give them such and
such a thing and appoint to them this and that.” Accordingly,
there came folk from all parts and places, nor had ten years passed
over him ere the island was peopled and the man became its King.<a id="r500"></a><a href="#f500" class="c011"><sup>[500]</sup></a>
No one came to him but he entreated him with munificence, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>his name was noised abroad, throughout the length and breadth of
the earth. Now his elder son had fallen into the hands of a man
who reared him and taught him polite accomplishments; and,
in like manner, the younger was adopted by one who gave him a
good education and brought him up in the ways of merchants.
The wife also happened upon a trader who entrusted to her his
property and made a covenant with her that he would not deal
dishonestly by her, but would aid her to obey Allah (to whom
belong Majesty and Might!); and he used to make her the companion
of his voyages and his travels. Now the elder son heard
the report of the King and resolved to visit him, without knowing
what he was; so he went to him and was well received by the King,
who made him his secretary. Presently the other son heard of the
King’s piety and justice and was also taken into his service as a
steward. Then the brothers abode awhile, neither knowing the
other, till it chanced that the merchant, in whose home was their
mother, also hearing of the King’s righteous and generous dealing
with the lieges, freighted a ship with rich stuffs and other excellent
produce of the land, and taking the woman with him, set sail for
the island. He made it in due course and landing, presented
himself with his gift before the King; who rejoiced therein with
exceeding joy and ordered him a splendid return-present. Now,
there were, among the gifts, certain aromatic roots of which he
would have the merchant acquaint him with the names and uses;
so he said to him, “Abide with us this night.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
King said, “Abide with us this night,” the merchant replied, “We
have in the ship one to whom I have promised to entrust the care
of her to none save myself; and the same is a holy woman whose
prayers have brought me weal and I have felt the blessing of her
counsels.” Rejoined the King, “I will send her some trusty men,
who shall pass the night in the ship and guard her and all that is
with her.” The merchant agreed to this and abode with the
King, who called his secretary and steward and said to them, “Go
and pass the night in this man’s ship and keep it safe, Inshallah!”
So they went up into the ship and seating themselves, this on the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_292">292</span>poop and that on the bow, passed a part of the night in repeating
the names of Allah (to whom belong Majesty and Might!). Then
quoth one to the other, “Ho, such an one! The King bade us
keep watch and I fear lest sleep overtake us; so, come, let us discourse
of stories of fortune and of the good we have seen and the
trials of life.” Quoth the other, “O my brother, as for my trials
Fate parted me from my mother and a brother of mine, whose
name was even as thine; and the cause of our parting was this.
My father took ship with us from such a place, and the winds rose
against us and were contrary, so that the ship was wrecked and
Allah broke our fair companionship.” Hearing this the first asked,
“What was the name of thy mother, O my brother?”; and the
second answered, “So and so.” Said the elder, “And of thy father?”;
said the younger, “So and so.” Thereat brother threw himself
upon brother saying, “By Allah, thou art my very brother!” And
each fell to telling the other what had befallen him in his youth,
whilst the mother heard all they said, but held her peace and in
patience possessed her soul. Now when it was morning, one said to
the other, “Come, brother, let us go to my lodging and talk there;”
and the other said, “‘Tis well.” So they went away and presently,
the merchant came back and finding the woman in great trouble,
said to her, “What hath befallen thee and why this concern?”
Quoth she, “Thou sentest to me yesternight men who tempted me
to evil, and I have been in sore annoy with them.” At this, he was
wroth and, repairing to the King, reported the conduct of his two
trusty wights. The King summoned the twain forthwith, as he loved
them for their fidelity and piety; and, sending for the woman, that
he might hear from her own lips what she had to say against them,
thus bespake her, “O woman, what hath betided thee from these two
men in whom I trust?” She replied, “O King, I conjure thee by
the Almighty, the Bountiful One, the Lord of the Empyrean, bid
them repeat the words they spoke yesternight.” So he said to them,
“Say what ye said and conceal naught thereof.” Accordingly, they
repeated their talk, and lo! the King rising from his throne, gave
a great cry and threw himself upon them, embracing them and
saying, “By Allah, ye are my very sons!” Therewith the woman
unveiled her face and said, “And by Allah, I am their very mother.”
So they were united and abode in all solace of life and its delight till
death parted them; and so glory be to Him who delivereth His
servant when he resorteth to Him, and disappointeth not his hope
in Him and his trust! And how well saith the poet on the subject:—</p>

</div>

<p class="c012">I had been many times to Meccah (Allah increase its honour!)
and the folk used to follow me for my knowledge of the road and
remembrance of the water-stations. It happened one year that I
was minded to make the pilgrimage to the Holy House and visitation
of the tomb of His Prophet (on whom be blessing and peace!),
and I said in myself, “I well know the way and will fare alone.”
So I set out and journeyed till I came to Al-Kadisíyah<a id="r502"></a><a href="#f502" class="c011"><sup>[502]</sup></a> and,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>entering the mosque there, saw a man suffering from black leprosy
seated in the prayer-niche. Quoth he on seeing me, “O Abu al-Hasan,
I crave thy company to Meccah.” Quoth I to myself, “I
fled from all my companions, and how shall I company with lepers?”
So I said to him, “I will bear no man company”; and he was
silent at my words. Next day I walked on alone, till I came to
Al-Akabah,<a id="r503"></a><a href="#f503" class="c011"><sup>[503]</sup></a> where I entered the mosque and found the leper
seated in the prayer-niche. So I said to myself, “Glory be to
Allah! how hath this fellow preceded me hither?” But he raised
his head to me and said with a smile, “O Abu al-Hasan, He doth
for the weak that which surpriseth the strong!” I passed that
night confounded at what I had seen; and, as soon as morning
dawned, set out again by myself; but when I came to Arafat<a id="r504"></a><a href="#f504" class="c011"><sup>[504]</sup></a> and
entered the mosque, behold, there was the leper seated in the niche!
So I threw myself upon him and kissing his feet said, “O my lord,
I crave thy company.” But he answered, “This may in no way
be.” Then I began weeping and wailing at the loss of his converse,
when he said, “Spare thy tears which will avail thee naught!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-second Night,</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu al-Hasan
continued:—Now when I saw the leper-man seated in the
prayer-niche, I threw myself upon him and said, “O my lord, I
crave thy company;” and fell to kissing his feet. But he answered,
“This may in no way be!” Then I began weeping and wailing
at the loss of his company when he said, “Spare thy tears which
will avail thee naught!”; and he recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Why dost thou weep when I depart and thou didst parting claim; ✿ And cravest union when we ne’er shall reunite the same?</div>
      <div class="line">Thou lookedest on nothing save my weakness and disease; ✿ And saidst “Nor goes nor comes, or night or day, this sickly frame.”</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_295">295</span>Seest not how Allah (glorified His glory ever be!) ✿ Deigneth to grant His slave’s petition wherewithal he came.</div>
      <div class="line">If I, to eyes of men be that and only that they see, ✿ And this my body show itself so full of grief and grame,</div>
      <div class="line">And have I naught of food that shall supply me to the place ✿ Where crowds unto my Lord resort impelled by single aim,</div>
      <div class="line">I have a high Creating Lord whose mercies aye are hid; ✿ A Lord who hath none equal and no fear is known to Him.</div>
      <div class="line">So fare thee safe and leave me lone in strangerhood to wone ✿ For He, the only One, consoles my loneliness so lone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Accordingly, I left him; but every station I came to, I found he had
foregone me, till I reached Al-Medinah, where I lost sight of him and
could hear no tidings of him. Here I met Abu Yazíd al-Bustámi
and Abu Bakr al-Shibli and a number of other Shaykhs and learned
men, to whom with many complaints, I told my case and they said,
“Heaven forbid that thou shouldst gain his company after this!
He was Abu Ja’afar the leper, in whose name folk at all times pray
for rain and by whose blessing-prayers their end attain.” When
I heard their words, my desire for his company redoubled and I
implored the Almighty to reunite me with him. Whilst I was
standing on Arafat,<a id="r505"></a><a href="#f505" class="c011"><sup>[505]</sup></a> one pulled me from behind, so I turned and
behold, it was my man. At this sight I cried out with a loud cry
and fell down in a fainting fit; but, when I came to myself he had
disappeared from my sight. This increased my yearning for him
and the ceremonies were tedious to me and I prayed Almighty
Allah to give me sight of him; nor was it but a few days after,
when lo! one pulled me from behind, and I turned and it was he
again. Thereupon he said, “Come, I conjure thee and ask thy
want of me.” So I begged him to pray for me three prayers; first,
that Allah would make me love poverty; secondly, that I might
never lie down at night upon provision assured to me; and thirdly,
that He would vouchsafe me to look upon His bountiful Face. So
he prayed for me as I wished, and departed from me. And
indeed Allah hath granted me what the devotee asked in prayer:
to begin with He hath made me so love poverty that, by the
Almighty! there is naught in the world dearer to me than it, and
secondly since such a year, I have never lain down to sleep upon
assured provision; withal hath He never let me lack aught. As
for the third prayer, I trust that He will vouchsafe me that also,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_296">296</span>even as He hath granted the two precedent for right Bountiful and
Beneficent is His Godhead, and Allah have mercy on him who

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r501">501</a>.  </span>Arabs note two kinds of leprosy, “Bahak” or “Baras” the common or white, and
“Juzám” the black leprosy; the leprosy of the joints, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mal rouge</span>. Both are attributed
to undue diet as eating fish and drinking milk; and both are treated with tonics, especially
arsenic. Leprosy is regarded by Moslems as a Scriptural malady on account of its prevalence
amongst the Israelites who, as Manetho tells us, were expelled from Egypt
because they infected and polluted the population. In mediæval Christendom an idea
prevailed that the Saviour was a leper; hence the term “morbus sacer”; the honours
paid to the sufferers by certain Saints and the Papal address (Clement III. <span class="sc"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">A.D.</span></span> 1189)
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">dilectis filiis leprosis</span>. (Farrar’s Life of Christ, i. 149.) For the “disgusting and impetuous
lust” caused by leprosy, see Sonnini (p. 560) who visited the lepers at Canea in
Candia. He is one of many who describes this symptom; but in the Brazil, where the
foul malady still prevails, I never heard of it.</p>

  <h2 id="c298" class="c007">THE QUEEN OF THE SERPENTS.<a id="r507"></a><a href="#f507" class="c011"><sup>[507]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c012">There was once, in days of yore and in ages and times long gone
before, a Grecian sage called Daniel, who had disciples and scholars;
and the wise men of Greece were obedient to his bidding and
relied upon his learning. Withal had Allah denied him a man-child.
One night, as he lay musing and weeping over the lack of a
son who might inherit his lore, he bethought him that Allah (extolled
and exalted be He!) heareth the prayer of those who resort
to Him and that there is no doorkeeper at the door of His bounties
and that He favoureth whom He will without compt and sendeth
no supplicant empty away; nay He filleth their hands with favours
and benefits. So he besought the Almighty, the Bountiful, to
vouchsafe him a son to succeed him, and to endow him abundantly
with His beneficence. Then he returned home and carnally knew
his wife who conceived by him the same night.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Grecian
sage returned home and knew his wife who conceived by him the
same night. A few days after this he took ship for a certain place,
but the ship was wrecked and he saved himself on one of her
planks, while only five leaves remained to him of all the books he
had. When he returned home, he laid the five leaves in a box and
locking it, gave the key to his wife (who then showed big with
child), and said to her, “Know that my decease is at hand and
that the time draweth nigh for my translation from this abode temporal
to the home which is eternal. Now thou art with child and
after my death wilt haply bear a son: if this be so, name him
Hásib Karím al-Dín<a id="r508"></a><a href="#f508" class="c011"><sup>[508]</sup></a> and rear him with the best of rearing.
When the boy shall grow up and shall say to thee:—What inheritance
<span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>did my father leave me? give him these five leaves, which
when he shall have read and understood, he will be the most
learned man of his time.” Then he farewelled her and heaving
one sigh, departed the world and all that is therein—the mercy of
Allah the Most Highest be upon Him! His family and friends wept
over him and washed him and bore him forth in great state and
buried him; after which they wended their ways home. But few
days passed ere his widow bare a handsome boy and named him
Hasib Karim al-Din, as her husband charged her; and immediately
after his birth she summoned the astrologers, who calculated his
ascendants and drawing his horoscope, said to her, “Know, O
woman! that this birth will live many a year; but that will be
after a great peril in the early part of his life, wherefrom an he
escape, he will be given the knowledge of all the exact sciences.”
So saying they went their ways. She suckled him two years,<a id="r509"></a><a href="#f509" class="c011"><sup>[509]</sup></a>
then weaned him, and when he was five years old, she placed him
in a school to learn his book, but he would read nothing. So she
took him from school and set him to learn a trade; but he would
not master any craft and there came no work from his hands. The
mother wept over this and the folk said to her, “Marry him: haply
he will take heart for his wife and learn him a trade.” So she
sought out a girl and married him to her; but, despite marriage
and the lapse of time, he remained idle as before, and would do
nothing. One day, some neighbours of hers, who were woodcutters,
came to her and said, “Buy thy son an ass and cords and an axe
and let him go with us to the mountain and we will all of us cut
wood for fuel. The price of the wood shall be his and ours, and he
shall provide thee and his wife with his share.” When she heard
this, she joyed with exceeding joy and bought her son an ass
and cords and hatchet; then, carrying him to the woodcutters,
delivered him into their hands and solemnly committed him to
their care. Said they, “Have no concern for the boy, our Lord
<span class="pageno" id="Page_299">299</span>will provide him: he is the son of our Shaykh.” So they carried
him to the mountain, where they cut firewood and loaded their
asses therewith; then returned to the city and, selling what they
had cut, spent the monies on their families. This they did on the
next day and the third and ceased not for some time, till it
chanced one day, a violent storm of rain broke over them, and
they took refuge in a great cave till the downfall should pass away.
Now Hasib Karim al-Din went apart from the rest into a corner
of the cavern and sitting down, fell to smiting the floor with his
axe. Presently he noted that the ground sounded hollow under
the hatchet; so he dug there awhile and came to a round flagstone
with a ring in it. When he saw this, he was glad and called his
comrades the woodcutters,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasib
Karim al-Din saw the flagstone with the ring, he was glad and
called his comrades the woodcutters, who came to him and,
finding it was fact, soon pulled up the stone and discovered under
it a trap-door, which, being opened, showed a cistern full of bees’
honey.<a id="r510"></a><a href="#f510" class="c011"><sup>[510]</sup></a> Then said they to one another, “This is a large store and
we have nothing for it but to return to the city and fetch vessels
wherein to carry away the honey, and sell it and divide the price,
whilst one of us stands by the cistern, to guard it from outsiders.”
Quoth Hasib, “I will stay and keep watch over it till you bring
your pots and pans.” So they left him on guard there and,
repairing to the city, fetched vessels, which they filled with honey
and loading their asses therewith, carried them to the streets and
sold the contents. They returned on the morrow and thus they
did several days in succession, sleeping in the town by night and
drawing off the stuff by day, whilst Hasib abode on guard by it
till but little remained, when they said one to other, “It was Hasib
Karim al-Din found the honey, and to-morrow he will come down
to the city and complain against us and claim the price of it,
saying, ‘Twas I found it; nor is there escape for us but that we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>let him down into the cistern, to bale out the rest of the honey,
and leave him there; so will he die of hunger, and none shall know
of him.” They all fell in with this plot as they were making for
the place; and, when they reached it, one said to him, “O Hasib,
go down into the pit and bale out for us the rest of the honey.” So
he went down and passed up to them what remained of the honey,
after which he said to them, “Draw me up, for there is nothing
left.” They made him no answer; but, loading their asses,
went off to the city and left him alone in the cistern. Thereupon
he fell to weeping and crying, “There is no Majesty and there is
no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!” Such was his
case; but as regards his comrades, when they reached the city and
sold the honey, they repaired to Hasib’s mother, weeping, and said
to her, “May thy head outlive thy son Hasib!” She asked,
“What brought about his death?” and they answered, “We were
cutting wood on the mountain-top, when there fell on us a heavy
downfall of rain and we took shelter from it in a cavern; and
suddenly thy son’s ass broke loose and fled into the valley, and he
ran after it, to turn it back, when there came out upon them a
great wolf, who tore thy son in pieces and ravined the ass.” When
the mother heard this, she beat her face and strewed dust on her
head and fell to mourning for her son; and she kept life and soul
together only by the meat and drink which they brought her every
day. As for the woodcutters they opened them shops and became
merchants and spent their lives in eating and drinking and laughing
and frolicking. Meanwhile Hasib Karim al-Din, who ceased
not to weep and call for help, sat down upon the cistern-edge
when behold, a great scorpion fell down on him; so he rose and
killed it. Then he took thought and said, “The cistern was full
of honey; how came this scorpion here?” Accordingly he got up
and examined the well right and left, till he found a crevice from
which the scorpion had fallen and saw the light of day shining
through it. So he took out his woodman’s knife and enlarged the
hole, till it was big as a window, when he crept through it and,
after walking for some time, came to a vast gallery, which led him
to a huge door of black iron bearing a padlock of silver wherein
was a key of gold. He stole up to the door and, looking through
the chink, saw a great light shining within; so he took the key
and, opening the door, went on for some time, till he came to a
large artificial lake, wherein he caught sight of something that
shimmered like silver. He walked up to it and at last he saw,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_301">301</span>hard by a hillock of green jasper and on the hill-top, a golden
throne studded with all manner gems,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasib
reached the hillock he found it of green jasper surmounted by a
golden throne studded with all manner gems, round which were
set many stools, some of gold, some of silver and others of leek-green
emerald. He clomb the hillock and, counting the stools,
found them twelve thousand in number; then he mounted the
throne which was set on the centre and, seating himself thereon,
fell to wondering at the lake and the stools, and he marvelled till
drowsiness overcame him and he dropt asleep. Presently, he was
aroused by a loud snorting and hissing and rustling, so he opened
his eyes; and, sitting up, saw each stool occupied by a huge
serpent, an hundred cubits in length. At this sight, great fear gat
hold of him; his spittle dried up for the excess of his dread and
he despaired of life, as all their eyes were blazing like live coals.
Then he turned towards the lake and saw that what he had taken
for shimmering water was a multitude of small snakes, none
knoweth their compt save Allah the Most High. After awhile,
there came up to him a serpent as big as a mule, bearing on its
back a tray of gold, wherein lay another serpent which shone like
crystal and whose face was as that of a woman<a id="r511"></a><a href="#f511" class="c011"><sup>[511]</sup></a> and who spake
with human speech. And as soon as she was brought up to
Hasib, she saluted him and he returned the salutation. Thereupon,
one of the serpents seated on the stools came up and,
lifting her off the tray, set her on one of the seats and she
cried out to the other serpents in their language, whereupon
they all fell down from their stools and did her homage. But
she signed to them to sit and they did so. Then she addressed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>Hasib, saying, “Have no fear of us, O youth; for I am the
Queen of the Serpents and their Sultánah.” When he heard
her speak on this wise, he took heart and she bade the serpents
bring him somewhat of food.<a id="r512"></a><a href="#f512" class="c011"><sup>[512]</sup></a> So they brought apples and grapes
and pomegranates and pistachio-nuts and filberts and walnuts
and almonds and bananas and set them before him, and the
Queen-serpent said, “Welcome, O youth! What is thy name?”
Answered he, “Hasib Karim al-Din;” and she rejoined, “O
Hasib, eat of these fruits, for we have no other meat and fear
thou nothing from us at all.” Hearing this, he ate his fill and
praised Allah Almighty; and presently they took away the trays
from before him, and the Queen said, “Tell me, O Hasib, whence
thou art and how camest thou hither and what hath befallen thee.”
So he told her his story from first to last, the death of his father;
his birth; his being sent to school where he learnt nothing; his
becoming a wood-cutter; his finding the honey-cistern; his being
abandoned therein; his killing the scorpion; his widening the
crevice; his finding the iron door and his coming upon the Queen,
and he ended his long tale with saying, “These be my adventures
from beginning to end and only Allah wotteth what will betide
me after all this!” Quoth the Queen, after listening to his words,
“Nothing save good shall betide thee:”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

  <h3 id="c304" class="c014"><em>THE ADVENTURES OF BULUKIYA.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c015">Know thou, O Hasib, there was once in the city of Cairo a King
of the Banu Isra’íl, a wise and a pious, who was bent double by
poring over books of learning, and he had a son named Bulúkiyá.
When he grew old and weak and was nigh upon death, his
Grandees and Officers of state came up to salute him, and he said
to them, “O folk, know that at hand is the hour of my march
from this world to the next, and I have no charge to lay on you,
save to commend to your care my son Bulukiya.” Then said he,
“I testify that there is no god save <em>the</em> God;” and, heaving one
sigh, departed the world—the mercy of Allah be upon him! They
laid him out and washed him and buried him with a procession of
great state. Then they made his son Bulukiya Sultan in his
stead; and he ruled the kingdom justly and the people had peace
in his time. Now it befel one day that he entered his father’s
treasuries, to look about him, and coming upon an inner compartment
and finding the semblance of a door opened it and passed
in. And lo! he found himself in a little closet, wherein stood
a column of white marble, on the top of which was a casket of
ebony; he opened this also and saw therein another casket of
gold, containing a book. He read the book and found in it an
account of our lord Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!)
and how he should be sent in the latter days<a id="r513"></a><a href="#f513" class="c011"><sup>[513]</sup></a> and be the lord of
the first Prophets and the last. On seeing the personal description
Bulukiya’s heart was taken with love of him, so he at once
assembled all the notables of the Children of Israel, the Cohens
or diviners, the scribes and the priests, and acquainted them with
the book, reading portions of it to them and, adding, “O folk,
needs must I bring my father out of his grave and burn him.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_304">304</span>The lieges asked, “Why wilt thou burn him?”; and he answered,
“Because he hid this book from me and imparted it not to me.”
Now the old King had excerpted it from the Torah or Pentateuch
and the Books of Abraham; and had set it in one of his treasuries
and concealed it from all living. Rejoined they, “O King, thy
father is dead; his body is in the dust and his affair is in the
hands of his Lord; thou shalt not take him forth of his tomb.”
So he knew that they would not suffer him to do this thing by his
sire and leaving them he repaired to his mother, to whom said he,
“O my mother, I have found, in one of my father’s treasuries,
a book containing a description of Mohammed (whom Allah bless
and keep!), a prophet who shall be sent in the latter days; and
my heart is captivated with love of him. Wherefore am I resolved
to wander over the earth, till I foregather with him; else I shall
die of longing for his love.” Then he doffed his clothes and
donned an Abá-gown of goat’s hair and coarse sandals, saying,
“O my mother, forget me not in thy prayers.” She wept over
him and said, “What will become of us after thee?”; but Bulukiya
answered, “I can endure no longer, and I commit my affair and
thine to Allah who is Almighty.” Then he set out on foot Syria-wards
without the knowledge of any of his folk, and coming to the
sea-board found a vessel whereon he shipped as one of the crew.
They sailed till he made an island, where Bulukiya landed with
the crew, but straying away from the rest he sat down under a tree
and sleep got the better of him. When he awoke, he sought the
ship but found that she had set sail without him, and in that island
he saw serpents as big as camels and palm-trees, which repeated
the names of Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) and blessed
Mohammed (whom the Lord assain and save!), proclaiming the
Unity and glorifying the Glorious; whereat he wondered——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Bulukiya saw the serpents glorifying God and proclaiming the
Unity, he wondered with extreme wonder. When they saw him,
they flocked to him and one of them said to him, “Who and
whence art thou, and whither goest thou, and what is thy name?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_305">305</span>Quoth he, “My name is Bulukiya; I am of the Children of Israel
and, being distracted for love of Mohammed (whom Allah bless
and keep!), I come in quest of him. But who are ye, O noble
creatures?” Answered they, “We are of the dwellers in the Jahannam-hell;
and Almighty Allah created us for the punishment
of Kafirs.” “And how came ye hither?” asked he, and the
Serpents answered, “Know, O Bulukiya, that Hell<a id="r514"></a><a href="#f514" class="c011"><sup>[514]</sup></a> of the greatness
of her boiling, breatheth twice a year, expiring in the summer
and inspiring in the winter, and hence the summer-heat and winter-cold.
When she exhaleth, she casteth us forth of her maw, and
we are drawn in again with her inhaled breath.” Quoth Bulukiya,
“Say me, are there greater serpents than you in Hell?”; and they
said, “Of a truth we are cast out with the expired breath but by
reason of our smallness; for in Hell every serpent is so great,
that were the biggest of us to pass over its nose it would not feel
us.<a id="r515"></a><a href="#f515" class="c011"><sup>[515]</sup></a>” Asked Bulukiya, “Ye sing the praises of Allah and invoke
blessings on Mohammed, whom the Almighty assain and save!
Whence wot ye of Mohammed?”; and they answered, “O Bulukiya,
verily his name is written on the gates of Paradise; and, but for
him, Allah had not created the worlds<a id="r516"></a><a href="#f516" class="c011"><sup>[516]</sup></a> nor Paradise, nor heaven
nor hell nor earth, for He made all things that be, solely on his
account, and hath conjoined his name with His own in every
place; wherefore we love Mohammed, whom Allah bless and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_306">306</span>preserve!” Now hearing the serpents’ converse did but inflame
Bulukiya’s love for Mohammed and yearning for his sight; so he
took leave of them; and, making his way to the sea-shore, found
there a ship made fast to the beach; he embarked therein as a
seaman and sailed nor ceased sailing till he came to another
island. Here he landed and walking about awhile found serpents
great and small, none knoweth their number save Almighty
Allah, and amongst them a white Serpent, clearer than crystal,
seated in a golden tray borne on the back of another serpent as
big as an elephant. Now this, O Hasib, was the Serpent-queen,
none other than myself. Quoth Hasib, “And what answer didst
thou make him?” Quoth she, “Know, O Hasib, that when I saw
Bulukiya, I saluted him with the salam, and he returned my salutation,”
and I said to him, “Who and what art thou and what is
thine errand and whence comest thou and whither goest thou?”
Answered he, “I am of the Children of Israel; my name is
Bulukiya, and I am a wanderer for the love of Mohammed,
whose description I have read in the revealed scriptures, and of
whom I go in search. But what art thou and what are these
serpents about thee?” Quoth I, “O Bulukiya, I am the Queen
of the Serpents; and when thou shalt foregather with Mohammed
(whom Allah assain and save!) bear him my salutation.”
Then Bulukiya took leave of me and journeyed till he came to
the Holy City which is Jerusalem. Now there was in that stead
a man who was deeply versed in all sciences, more especially in
geometry and astronomy and mathematics, as well as in white
magic<a id="r517"></a><a href="#f517" class="c011"><sup>[517]</sup></a> and Spiritualism; and he had studied the Pentateuch and
the Evangel and the Psalms and the Books of Abraham. His
name was Affán; and he had found in certain of his books, that
whoso should wear the seal-ring of our lord Solomon, men and
Jinn and birds and beasts and all created things would be bound to
obey him. Moreover, he had discovered that our lord Solomon
had been buried in a coffin which was miraculously transported
beyond the Seven Seas to the place of burial;——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div><span class="pageno" id="Page_307">307</span></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Affan had
found in certain books that none, mortal or spirit, could pluck the
seal-ring from the lord Solomon’s finger; and that no navigator
could sail his ship upon the Seven Seas over which the coffin had
been carried. Moreover, he had found out by reading that there
was a herb of herbs and that if one express its juice and anoint
therewith his feet, he should walk upon the surface of any sea
that Allah Almighty had created without wetting his soles; but
none could obtain this herb, without he had with him the Serpent-queen.
When Bulukiya arrived at the Holy City, he at once
sat down to do his devotions and worship the Lord; and, whilst
he was so doing, Affan came up and saluted him as a True Believer.
Then seeing him reading the Pentateuch and adoring the
Almighty, he accosted him saying, “What is thy name, O man;
and whence comest thou and whither goest thou?” He answered,
“My name is Bulukiya; I am from the city of Cairo and am
come forth wandering in quest of Mohammed, whom Allah bless
and preserve!” Quoth Affan, “Come with me to my lodging that
I may entertain thee.” “To hear is to obey,” replied Bulukiya.
So the devotee took him by the hand and carried him to his
house where he entreated him with the utmost honour and presently
said to him, “Tell me thy history, O my brother, and how
thou camest by the knowledge of Mohammed (whom Allah assain
and save!) that thy heart hath been taken with love of him and
compelled thee to fare forth and seek him; and lastly tell me
who it was directed thee in this road.” So he related to him his
tale in its entirety; whereupon Affan, who well-nigh lost his wits
for wonder, said to him, “Make tryst for me with the Queen of the
Serpents and I will bring thee in company with Mohammed, albeit
the date of his mission is yet far distant. We have only to prevail
upon the Queen and carry her in a cage to a certain mountain
where the herbs grow; and, as long as she is with us, the plants as
we pass them will parley with human speech and discover their
virtues by the ordinance of Allah the Most High. For I have
found in my books that there is a certain herb and all who express
its juice and anoint therewith their feet shall walk upon whatsoever
sea Almighty Allah hath made, without wetting sole. When we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_308">308</span>have found the magical herb, we will let her go her way; and then
will we anoint our feet with the juice and cross the Seven Seas,
till we come to the burial-place of our lord Solomon. Then we
will take the ring off his finger and rule even as he ruled and win
all our wishes; we will enter the Main of Murks<a id="r518"></a><a href="#f518" class="c011"><sup>[518]</sup></a> and drink of
the Water of Life, and so the Almighty will let us tarry till the
End of Time and we shall foregather with Mohammed, whom
Allah bless and preserve!” Hearing these words Bulukiya
replied, “O Affan, I will make tryst for thee with the Serpent-queen
and at once show thee her abiding place.” So Affan made
him a cage of iron; and, providing himself with two bowls, one full
of wine and the other of milk, took ship with Bulukiya and sailed
till they came to the island, where they landed and walked upon
it. Then Affan set up the cage, in which he laid a noose and
withdrew after placing in it the two bowls; when he and Bulukiya
concealed themselves afar off. Presently, up came the Queen of
the Serpents (that is, myself) and examined the cage. When she
(that is I) smelt the savour of the milk, she came down from the
back of the snake which bore her tray and, entering the cage,
drank up the milk. Then she went to the bowl of wine and drank
of it, whereupon her head became giddy and she slept. When
Affan saw this, he ran up and locking the cage upon her, set it on
his head and made for the ship, he and Bulukiya. After awhile
she awoke and finding herself in a cage of iron on a man’s head
and seeing Bulukiya walking beside the bearer, said to him, “This
is the reward of those who do no hurt to the sons of Adam.”
Answered he, “O Queen, have no fear of us, for we will do thee
no hurt at all. We wish thee only to show us the herb which,
when pounded and squeezed yieldeth a juice, and this rubbed upon
the feet conferreth the power of walking dryshod upon what sea
soever Almighty Allah hath created; and when we have found
that we will return thee to thy place and let thee wend thy way.”
Then Affan and Bulukiya fared on for the hills where grew the
herbs; and, as they went about with the Queen, each plant they
passed began to speak and avouch its virtues by permission of
Allah the Most High. As they were thus doing and the herbs
speaking right and left behold, a plant spoke out and said, “I am
the herb ye seek, and all who gather and crush me and anoint
<span class="pageno" id="Page_309">309</span>their feet with my juice, shall fare over what sea soever Allah
Almighty hath created and yet ne’er wet sole.” When Affan
heard this, he set down the cage from his head and, gathering
what might suffice them of the herb, crushed it and filling
two vials with the juice kept them for future use; and with
what was left they anointed their feet. Then they took up the
Serpent-queen’s cage and journeyed days and nights, till they
reached the island, where they opened the cage and let out her,
that is me. When I found myself at liberty, I asked them what
use they would make of the juice; and they answered, “We
design to anoint our feet and to cross the Seven Seas to the
burial-place of our lord Solomon<a id="r519"></a><a href="#f519" class="c011"><sup>[519]</sup></a> and take the seal-ring from his
finger.” Quoth I, “Far, far is it from your power to possess yourselves
of the ring!” They enquired, “Wherefore?” and I
replied, “Because Almighty Allah vouchsafed unto our lord
Solomon the gift of this ring and distinguished him thereby, for
that he said to Him:—O Lord, give me a kingdom which may
not be obtained after me; for Thou verily art the Giver of
kingdoms.<a id="r520"></a><a href="#f520" class="c011"><sup>[520]</sup></a> So that ring is not for you.” And I added, “Had
ye twain taken the herb, whereof all who eat shall not die until
the First Blast,<a id="r521"></a><a href="#f521" class="c011"><sup>[521]</sup></a> it had better availed you than this ye have gotten;
for ye shall nowise come at your desire thereby.” Now when they
heard this, they repented them with exceeding penitence and
went their ways.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bulukiya
and Affan heard these words, they repented them with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_310">310</span>exceeding penitence and went their ways. Such was their case;
but as regards myself (continued the Serpent-queen) I went in
quest of my host and found it fallen in piteous case, the stronger
of them having grown weak in my absence and the weaker having
died. When they saw me, they rejoiced and flocking about me,
asked, “What hath befallen thee, and where hast thou been?” So
I told them what had passed, after which I gathered my forces
together and repaired with them to the mountain Kaf, where I
wont to winter, summer-freshing in the place where thou now seest
me, O Hasib Karim al-Din. This, then, is my story and what
befel me. Thereupon Hasib marvelled at her words and said to
her, “I beseech thee, of thy favour, bid one of thy guards bear me
forth to the surface of the earth, that I may go to my people.” She
replied, “O Hasib, thou shalt not have leave to depart from us till
winter come, and needs must thou go with us to the Mountain Kaf
and solace thyself with the sight of the hills and sands and trees
and birds magnifying the One God, the Victorious; and look upon
Marids and Ifrits and Jinn, whose number none knoweth save
Almighty Allah.” When Hasib heard this, he was sore chafed
and chagrined: then he said to her, “Tell me of Affan and Bulukiya;
when they departed from thee and went their way, did
they cross the Seven Seas and reach the burial-place of our lord
Solomon or not; and if they did had they power to take the ring
or not?” Answered she, “Know, that when they left me, they
anointed their feet with the juice; and, walking over the water,
fared on from sea to sea, diverting themselves with the wonders of
the deep, nor ceased they faring till they had traversed the Seven
Seas and came in sight of a mountain, soaring high in air, whose
stones were emeralds and whose dust was musk; and in it was a
stream of running water. When they made it they rejoiced, saying
each to other:—Verily we have won our wish; and they entered
the passes of the mountain and walked on, till they saw from afar
a cavern surmounted by a great dome, shining with light. So they
made for the cavern, and entering it beheld therein a throne of
gold studded with all manner jewels, and about it stools whose
number none knoweth save Allah Almighty. And they saw lying
at full length upon the throne our lord Solomon, clad in robes of
green silk inwoven with gold and broidered with jewels and precious
minerals: his right hand was passed over his breast and on
the middle finger was the seal-ring whose lustre outshone that of
all other gems in the place. Then Affan taught Bulukiya adjurations
<span class="pageno" id="Page_311">311</span>and conjurations galore and said to him:—Repeat these
conjurations and cease not repeating until I take the ring. Then
he went up to the throne; but, as he drew near unto it lo! a
mighty serpent came forth from beneath it and cried out at him
with so terrible a cry that the whole place trembled and sparks
flew from its mouth, saying, Begone, or thou art a dead man!
But Affan busied himself with his incantations and suffered himself
not to be startled thereby. Then the serpent blew such a fiery
blast at him, that the place was like to be set on fire, and said to
him, Woe to thee! Except thou turn back, I will consume thee!
Hearing these words Bulukiya left the cave, but Affan, who
suffered himself not to be troubled, went up to the Prophet: then
he put out his hand to the ring and touched it and strove to draw
it off the lord Solomon’s finger; and behold, the serpent blew on
him once more and he became a heap of ashes. Such was his
case; but as regards Bulukiya he fell down in a swoon.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen
continued:—When Bulukiya saw Affan burnt up by the fire and
become a heap of ashes, he fell down in a swoon. Thereupon the
Lord (magnified be His Majesty!) bade Gabriel descend earthwards
and save him ere the serpent should blow on him. So
Gabriel descended without delay and, finding Affan reduced to
ashes and Bulukiya in a fit, aroused him from his trance and saluting
him, asked, “How camest thou hither?” Bulukiya related to
him his history from first to last, adding, “Know that I came not
hither but for the love of Mohammed (whom Allah assain and
save!), of whom Affan informed me that his mission would take
place at the End of Time; moreover that none should foregather
with him but those who endured to the latter days by drinking
of the Water of Life through means of Solomon’s seal. So I companied
him hither and there befel him what befel; but I escaped
the fire and now it is my desire that thou inform me where Mohammed
is to be found.” Quoth Gabriel, “O Bulukiya, go thy
ways, for the time of Mohammed’s coming is yet far distant.”
Then he ascended up to heaven forthright, and Bulukiya wept
<span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>with sore weeping and repented of that which he had done, calling
to mind my words, whenas I said to them, “Far is it from
man’s power to possess himself of the ring.” Then he descended
from the mountain and returned in exceeding confusion to the
sea-shore and passed the night there, marvelling at the mountains
and seas and islands around him. When morning dawned, he
anointed his feet with the herb-juice and descending to the water,
set out and fared on over the surface of the seas days and nights,
astonied at the terrors of the main and the marvels and wonders of
the deep, till he came to an island as it were the Garden of Eden.
So he landed and, finding himself in a great and pleasant island,
paced about it and saw with admiration that its dust was saffron
and its gravel carnelian and precious minerals; its hedges were of
jessamine, its vegetation was of the goodliest of trees and of the
brightest of odoriferous shrubs; its brushwood was of Comorin and
Sumatran aloes-wood and its reeds were sugar-canes. Round about
it were roses and narcissus and amaranths and gilly-flowers and
chamomiles and white lilies and violets, and other flowers of all
kinds and colours. Of a truth the island was the goodliest place,
abounding in space, rich in grace, a compendium of beauty material
and spiritual. The birds warbled on the boughs with tones
far sweeter than chaunt of Koran and their notes would console a
lover whom longings unman. And therein the gazelle frisked free
and fain and wild cattle roamed about the plain. Its trees were of
tallest height; its streams flowed bright; its springs welled with
waters sweet and light; and all therein was a delight to sight and
sprite. Bulukiya marvelled at the charms of the island but knew
that he had strayed from the way he had first taken in company
with Affan. He wandered about the place and solaced him with
various spectacles until nightfall, when he climbed into a tree to
sleep; but as he sat there, musing over the beauty of the site,
behold, the sea became troubled and there rose up to the surface a
great beast, which cried out with a cry so terrible that every living
thing upon the isle trembled. As Bulukiya gazed upon him from
the tree and marvelled at the bigness of his bulk, he was presently
followed unexpectedly by a multitude of other sea-beasts in kind
manifold, each holding in his fore-paw a jewel which shone like a
lamp, so that the whole island became as light as day for the lustre
of the gems. After awhile, there appeared, from the heart of the
island, wild beasts of the land, none knoweth their number save
Allah the Most High; amongst which Bulukiya noted lions and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_313">313</span>panthers and lynxes and other ferals; and these land-beasts
flocked down to the shore; and, foregathering with the sea-beasts,
conversed with them till daybreak, when they separated and each
went his own way. Thereupon Bulukiya, terrified by what he had
seen, came down from the tree and, making the sea-shore, anointed
his feet with the magical juice, and set out once more upon the
surface of the water. He fared on days and nights over the
Second Sea, till he came to a great mountain skirting which ran a
Wady without end, the stones whereof were magnetic iron and its
beasts lions and hares and panthers. He landed on the mountain-foot
and wandered from place to place till nightfall, when he sat
down sheltered by one of the base-hills on the sea-side, to eat of
the dried fish thrown up by the sea. Presently, he turned from
his meal and behold, a huge panther was creeping up to rend
and ravin him; so he anointed his feet in haste with the juice
and, descending to the surface of the water, fled walking over the
Third Sea, in the darkness; for the night was black and the wind
blew stark. Nor did he stay his course till he reached another
island, whereon he landed and found there trees bearing fruits both
fresh and dry.<a id="r522"></a><a href="#f522" class="c011"><sup>[522]</sup></a> So he took of these fruits and ate and praised
Allah Almighty; after which he walked for solace about the island
till eventide.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bulukiya
(continued the Queen) walked for solace about the island till eventide,
when he lay down to sleep. As soon as day brake, he began
to explore the place and ceased not for ten days, after which he
again made the shore and anointed his feet and, setting out over
the Fourth Sea, walked upon it many nights and days, till he came
to a third island of fine white sand without sign of trees or grass.
He walked about it awhile but, finding its only inhabitants sakers
which nested in the sand, he again anointed his feet and trudged
over the Fifth Sea, walking night and day till he came to a little
island, whose soil and hills were like crystal. Therein were the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_314">314</span>veins wherefrom gold is worked; and therein also were marvellous
trees whose like he had never seen in his wanderings, for their
blossoms were in hue as gold. He landed and walked about for
diversion till it was nightfall, when the flowers began to shine
through the gloom like stars. Seeing this sight, he marvelled
and said, “Assuredly, the flowers of this island are of those which
wither under the sun and fall to the earth, where the winds smite
them and they gather under the rocks and become the Elixir,<a id="r523"></a><a href="#f523" class="c011"><sup>[523]</sup></a> which
the folk collect and thereof make gold.” He slept there all that
night and at sunrise he again anointed his feet and, descending to
the shore, fared on over the Sixth Sea nights and days, till he came
to a fifth island. Here he landed and found, after walking an hour
or so, two mountains covered with a multitude of trees, whose
fruits were as men’s heads hanging by the hair, and others whose
fruits were green birds hanging by the feet; also a third kind,
whose fruits were like aloes, if a drop of the juice fell on a man it
burnt like fire; and others, whose fruits wept and laughed, besides
many other marvels which he saw there. Then he returned to the
sea-shore and, finding there a tall tree, sat down beneath it till
supper-time when he climbed up into the branches to sleep. As
he sat considering the wonderful works of Allah behold, the waters
became troubled, and there rose therefrom the daughters of the sea,
each mermaid holding in her hand a jewel which shone like the
morning. They came ashore and, foregathering under the trees,
sat down and danced and sported and made merry whilst Bulukiya
amused himself with watching and wondering at their gambols,
which were prolonged till the morning, when they returned to the
sea and disappeared. Then he came down and, anointing his feet,
set out on the surface of the Seventh Sea, over which he journeyed
two whole months, without getting sight of highland or island or
broadland or lowland or shoreland, till he came to the end thereof.
And so doing he suffered exceeding hunger, so that he was forced
to snatch up fishes from the surface of the sea and devour them
raw, for stress of famine. In such case he pushed on till in early
forenoon he came to the sixth island, with trees a-growing and rills
a-flowing, where he landed and walked about, looking right and left,
till he came to an apple-tree and put forth his hand to pluck of
the fruit, when lo! one cried out to him from the tree, saying, “An
<span class="pageno" id="Page_315">315</span>thou draw near to this tree and cut of it aught, I will cut thee in
twain.” So he looked and saw a giant forty cubits high, being the
cubit of the people of that day; whereat he feared with sore fear and
refrained from that tree. Then said he to the giant, “Why dost
thou forbid me to eat of this tree?” Replied the other, “Because
thou art a son of Adam and thy father Adam forgot the covenant
of Allah and sinned against Him and ate of the tree.” Quoth
Bulukiya, “What thing art thou and to whom belongeth this island,
with its trees, and how art thou named?” Quoth the tall one,
“My name is Sharáhiyá and trees and island belong to King
Sakhr;<a id="r524"></a><a href="#f524" class="c011"><sup>[524]</sup></a> I am one of his guards and in charge of his dominion,”
presently adding, “But who art thou and whence comest thou
hither?” Bulukiya told him his story from beginning to end
and Sharahiya said, “Be of good cheer,” and brought him to eat.
So he ate his fill and, taking leave of the giant, set out again and
ceased not faring on over the mountains and sandy deserts for ten
days; at the end of which time he saw, in the distance, a dust-cloud
hanging like a canopy in air; and, making towards it, he
heard a mighty clamour, cries and blows and sounds of mellay.
Presently he reached a great Wady, two months’ journey long;
and, looking whence the shouts came, he saw a multitude of horsemen
engaged in fierce fight and the blood running from them till
it railed like a river. Their voices were thunderous and they were
armed with lance and sword and iron mace and bow and arrow,
and all fought with the utmost fury. At this sight he felt sore
affright——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

Bulukiya saw the host in fight, he felt sore affright
and was perplexed about his case; but whilst he hesitated, behold,
they caught sight of him and held their hands one from other and
left fighting. Then a troop of them came up to him, wondering
at his make, and one of the horsemen said to him, “What art
thou and whence camest thou hither and whither art wending;
and who showed thee the way that thou hast come to our
<span class="pageno" id="Page_316">316</span>country?” Quoth he, “I am of the sons of Adam and am come
out, distracted for the love of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and
preserve!); but I have wandered from my way.” Quoth the
horseman, “Never saw we a son of Adam till now, nor did any
ever come to this land.” And all marvelled at him and at his
speech. “But what are ye, O creatures?” asked Bulukiya; and
the rider replied, “We are of the Jánn.” So he said, “O Knight,
what is the cause of the fighting amongst you and where is your
abiding-place and what is the name of this valley and this land?”
He replied, “Our abiding-place is the White Country; and, every
year, Allah Almighty commandeth us to come hither and wage war
upon the unbelieving Jann.” Asked Bulukiya, “And where is the
White Country?” and the horseman answered, “It is behind the
mountain Kaf, and distant seventy-five years journey from this
place which is termed the Land of Shaddád son of ‘Ád: we
are here for Holy War; and we have no other business, when we
are not doing battle, than to glorify God and hallow him. Moreover,
we have a ruler, King Sakhr hight, and needs must thou go
with us to him, that he may look upon thee for his especial delight.”
Then they fared on (and he with them) till they came to
their abiding place; where he saw a multitude of magnificent
tents of green silk, none knoweth their number save Allah the
Most High, and in their midst a pavilion of red satin, some thousand
cubits in compass, with cords of blue silk and pegs of gold
and silver. Bulukiya marvelled at the sight and accompanied them
as they fared on and behold, this was the royal pavilion. So they
carried him into the presence of King Sakhr, whom he found
seated upon a splendid throne of red gold, set with pearls and
studded with gems; the Kings and Princes of the Jann being on
his right hand, and on his left his Councillors and Emirs and
Officers of state, and a multitude of others. The King seeing him
bade introduce him, which they did; and Bulukiya went up to
him and saluted him after kissing the ground before him. The
King returned his salute and said, “Draw near me, O mortal!”
and Bulukiya went close up to him. Hereupon the King, commanding
a chair to be set for him by his royal side, bade him sit
down and asked him “Who art thou?”; and Bulukiya answered,
“I am a man, and one of the Children of Israel.” “Tell me thy
story,” cried King Sakhr, “and acquaint me with all that hath
befallen thee and how thou camest to this my land.” So Bulukiya
related to him all that had occurred in his wanderings from

<p class="c000">She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen
continued:—When Bulukiya related to Sakhr what befel him in
his wanderings, he marvelled thereat. Then he bade the servants
bring food and they spread the tables and set on one thousand and
five hundred platters of red gold and silver and copper, some containing
twenty and some fifty boiled camels, and others some fifty
head of sheep; at which Bulukiya marvelled with exceeding
marvel. Then they ate and he ate with them, till he was satisfied
and returned thanks to Allah Almighty; after which they cleared
the tables and set on fruits, and they ate thereof, glorifying the
name of God and invoking blessings on His prophet Mohammed
(whom Allah bless and preserve!) When Bulukiya heard them
make mention of Mohammed, he wondered and said to King
Sakhr, “I am minded to ask thee some questions.” Rejoined the
King, “Ask what thou wilt,” and Bulukiya said, “O King, what
are ye and what is your origin and how came ye to know of
Mohammed (whom Allah assain and save!) that ye draw near
to him and love him?” King Sakhr answered, “O Bulukiya, of
very sooth Allah created the fire in seven stages, one above the
other, and each distant a thousand years’ journey from its neighbour.
The first stage he named Jahannam<a id="r525"></a><a href="#f525" class="c011"><sup>[525]</sup></a> and appointed the
same for the punishment of the transgressors of the True-believers,
who die unrepentant; the second he named Lazá and appointed
for Unbelievers: the name of the third is Jahím and is appointed
for Gog and Magog.<a id="r526"></a><a href="#f526" class="c011"><sup>[526]</sup></a> The fourth is called Sa’ír and is appointed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_318">318</span>for the host of Iblis. The fifth is called Sakar and is prepared
for those who neglect prayer. The sixth is called Hatamah and
is appointed for Jews and Christians. The seventh is named
Háwiyah and is prepared for hypocrites. Such be the seven
stages.” Quoth Bulukiya, “Haply Jahannam hath least of torture
for that it is the uppermost.” “Yes,” quoth King Sakhr, “the
most endurable of them all is Jahannam; natheless in it are
a thousand mountains of fire, in each mountain seventy thousand
cities of fire, in each city seventy thousand castles of fire, in each
castle seventy thousand houses of fire, in each house seventy thousand
couches of fire and in each couch seventy thousand manners
of torment. As for the other hells, O Bulukiya, none knoweth
the number of kinds of torment that be therein save Allah
Most Highest.” When Bulukiya heard this, he fell down in a
fainting-fit, and when he came to himself, he wept and said, “O
King what will be my case?” Quoth Sakhr, “Fear not, and
know thou that whoso loveth Mohammed (whom Allah bless and
keep!) the fire shall not burn him, for he is made free therefrom
for his sake; and whoso belongeth to his Faith the fire shall
fly him. As for us, the Almighty Maker created us of the fire;
for the first that he made in Jahannam were two of His host,
whom he called Khalít and Malít. Now Khalít was fashioned in
the likeness of a lion, with a tail like a tortoise twenty years’
journey in length and ending in a member masculine; while Malít
was like a pied wolf whose tail was furnished with a member feminine.
Then Almighty Allah commanded the tails to couple and
copulate and do the deed of kind, and of them were born serpents
and scorpions, whose dwelling is in the fire, that Allah may therewith
torment those whom He casteth therein; and these increased
and multiplied. Then Allah commanded the tails of Khalit and
Malit to couple and copulate a second time, and the tail of Malit
conceived by the tail of Khalit and bore fourteen children, seven
male and seven female, who grew up and intermarried one with
other. All were obedient to their sire, save one who disobeyed
him and was changed into a worm which is Iblis (the curse of
Allah be upon him!). Now Iblis was one of the Cherubim, for he
had served Allah till he was raised to the heavens and cherished<a id="r527"></a><a href="#f527" class="c011"><sup>[527]</sup></a>
by the especial favour of the Merciful One, who made him chief

He commanded Iblis to prostrate himself to him, but he drew

Bulukiya is our provenance.<a id="r529"></a><a href="#f529" class="c011"><sup>[529]</sup></a> Bulukiya marvelled at the King’s
words and said, “O King, I pray thee bid one of thy guards bear
me back to my native land.” “Naught of this may we do,”
answered Sakhr, “save by commandment of Allah Almighty;
however, an thou desire to leave us and return home, I will mount
thee on one of my mares and cause her carry thee to the farthest
frontiers of my dominions, where thou wilt meet with the troops
of another King, Barákhiyá hight, who will recognize the mare at
sight and take thee off her and send her back to us; and this is
all we can do for thee, and no more.” When Bulukiya heard these
words he wept and said, “Do whatso thou wilt.” So King Sakhr
caused bring the mare and, setting Bulukiya on her back, said to
him, “Beware lest thou alight from her or strike her or cry out in
her face; for if thou do so she will slay thee; but abide quietly
riding on her back till she stop with thee; then dismount and
wend thy ways.” Quoth Bulukiya, “I hear and I obey;” he then
mounted and setting out, rode on a long while between the rows
of tents; and stinted not riding till he came to the royal kitchens
where he saw the great cauldrons, each holding fifty camels, hung
up over the fires which blazed fiercely under them. So he stopped
<span class="pageno" id="Page_320">320</span>there and gazed with a marvel ever increasing till King Sakhr
thinking him to be anhungered, bade bring him two roasted
camels; and they carried them to him and bound them behind
him on the mare’s crupper. Then he took leave of them and fared
on, till he came to the end of King Sakhr’s dominions, where the
mare stood still and Bulukiya dismounted and began to shake the
dust of the journey from his raiment. And behold, there accosted
him a party of men who, recognising the mare, carried her and
Bulukiya before their King Barakhiya. So he saluted him, and
the King returned his greeting and seated him beside himself in
a splendid pavilion, in the midst of his troops and champions
and vassal Princes of the Jann ranged to right and left; after
which he called for food and they ate their fill and pronounced
the Alhamdolillah. Then they set on fruits, and when they
had eaten thereof, King Barakhiya, whose estate was like that
of King Sakhr, asked his guest, “When didst thou leave King
Sakhr?” And Bulukiya answered, “Two days ago.” Quoth
Barakhiya, “Dost thou know, how many days’ journey thou hast
come in these two days?” Quoth he, “No,” and the King
rejoined, “Thou hast come a journey of threescore and ten
months.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and

    <div>Now when it was the Four Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen
continued:—Barakhiya said to Bulukiya, “In two days thou hast
come a journey of threescore and ten months; moreover when thou
mountest the mare, she was affrighted at thee, knowing thee
for a son of Adam, and would have thrown thee; so they bound
on her back these two camels by way of weight to steady her.”
When Bulukiya heard this, he marvelled and thanked Allah
Almighty for safety. Then said the King, “Tell me thy
adventures and what brought thee to this our land.” So he
told him his story from first to last, and the King marvelled at
his words, and kept Bulukiya with him two months. Upon this
Hasib Karim al-Din after he had marvelled at her story, again
besought the Serpent-queen saying, “I pray thee of thy goodness
and graciousness command one of thy subjects conduct me to the
surface of the earth, that I may return to my family;” but she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_321">321</span>answered, “O Hasib, I know that the first thing thou wilt do,
after seeing the face of the earth will be to greet thy family and
then repair to the Hammam-bath and bathe; and the moment
thou endest thine ablutions will see the last of me, for it will be
the cause of my death.” Quoth Hasib, “I swear that I will never
again enter the Hammam-bath so long as I live, but when
washing is incumbent on me, I will wash at home.” Rejoined
the Queen, “I would not trust thee though thou shouldst swear
to me an hundred oaths; for such abstaining is not possible; and
I know thee to be a son of Adam for whom no oath is sacred.
Thy father Adam made a covenant with Allah the most High,
who kneaded the clay whereof He fashioned him forty mornings
and made His angels prostrate themselves to him; yet after all
his promise did he forget and his oath violate, disobeying the
commandment of his Lord.” When Hasib heard this, he held
his peace and burst into tears; nor did he leave weeping for the
space of ten days, at the end of which time he said to the Queen,
“Prithee acquaint me with the rest of Bulukiya’s adventures.”
Accordingly, she began again as follows:—Know, O Hasib, that
Bulukiya, after abiding two months with King Barakhiya, farewelled
him and fared on over wastes and deserts nights and days,
till he came to a high mountain which he ascended. On the
summit he beheld seated a great Angel glorifying the names
of God and invoking blessings on Mohammed. Before him lay
a tablet covered with characters, these white and those black,<a id="r530"></a><a href="#f530" class="c011"><sup>[530]</sup></a>
whereon his eyes were fixed, and his two wings were outspread to
the full, one to the western and the other to the eastern horizon.
Bulukiya approached and saluted the Angel, who returned his
salam adding, “Who art thou and whence comest thou and
whither wendest thou and what is thy story?” Accordingly, he
repeated to him his history, from first to last, and the Angel
marvelled mightily thereat, whereupon Bulukiya said to him, “I
pray thee in return acquaint me with the meaning of this table
and what is writ thereon; and what may be thine occupation
and thy name.” Replied the Angel, “My name is Michael, and
I am charged with the shifts of night and day; and this is my
occupation till the Day of Doom.” Bulukiya wondered at his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_322">322</span>words and at his aspect and the vastness of his stature and,
taking leave of him, fared onwards, night and day, till he came
to a vast meadow over which he walked observing that it was
traversed by seven streams and abounded in trees. He was
struck by its beauty and in one corner thereof he saw a great
tree and under it four Angels. So he drew near to them and
found the first in the likeness of a man, the second in the likeness
of a wild beast, the third in the likeness of a bird and the fourth
in the likeness of a bull, engaged in glorifying Almighty Allah,
and saying, “O my God and my Master and my Lord, I conjure
Thee, by Thy truth and by the degree of Thy Prophet Mohammed
(on whom be blessings and peace!) to vouchsafe Thy mercy and
grant Thy forgiveness to all things created in my likeness; for
Thou over all things art Almighty!” Bulukiya marvelled at
what he heard but continued his journey till he came to another
mountain and ascending it, found there a great Angel seated on
the summit, glorifying God and hallowing Him and invoking
blessings on Mohammed (whom Allah assain and save!);
and he saw that Angel continually opening and shutting his
hands and bending and extending his fingers. He accosted
him and saluted him; whereupon the Angel returned his salam
and enquired who he was and how he came thither. So Bulukiya
acquainted him with his adventures including his having lost the
way; and besought him to tell him, in turn, who he was and
what was his function and what mountain was that. Quoth the
Angel, “Know, O Bulukiya, that this is the mountain Kaf, which
encompasseth the world; and all the countries the Creator hath
made are in my grasp. When the Almighty is minded to visit
any land with earthquake or famine or plenty or slaughter or
prosperity, He biddeth me carry out His commands and I carry
them out without stirring from my place; for know thou that
my hands lay hold upon the roots of the earth,”——And Shahrazad

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Queen continued:—When
the angel said, “And know thou that my hands lay
hold upon the roots of the earth,” he asked, “And hath Allah created
<span class="pageno" id="Page_323">323</span>other worlds than this within the mountain Kaf?” The Angel
answered, “Yes, He hath made a world white as silver, whose vastness
none knoweth save Himself, and hath peopled it with Angels,
whose meat and drink are His praise and hallowing and continual
blessings upon His Prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and
keep!). Every Thursday night<a id="r531"></a><a href="#f531" class="c011"><sup>[531]</sup></a> they repair to this mountain and
worship in congregation Allah until the morning, and they assign
the future recompense of their lauds and litanies to the sinners of
the Faith of Mohammed (whom Allah assain and save!) and to
all who make the Ghusl-ablution of Friday; and this is their
function until the Day of Resurrection.” Asked Bulukiya, “And
hath Allah created other mountains behind the mountain Kaf?”;
whereto he answered, “Yes, behind this mountain is a range of
mountains five hundred years’ journey long, of snow and ice, and this
it is that wardeth off the heat of Jahannam from the world, which
verily would else be consumed thereby. Moreover, behind the
mountain Kaf are forty worlds, each one the bigness of this world
forty times told, some of gold and some of silver and others of
carnelian. Each of these worlds hath its own colour, and Allah
hath peopled them with angels, that know not Eve nor Adam nor
night nor day, and have no other business than to celebrate His
praises and hallow Him and make profession of His Unity and
proclaim His Omnipotence and supplicate Him on behalf of the
followers of Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!). And
know, also, O Bulukiya, that the earths were made in seven stages,
one upon another, and that Allah hath created one of His Angels,
whose stature and attributes none knoweth but Himself and who
beareth the seven stages upon his shoulders. Under this Angel
Almighty Allah hath created a great rock, and under the rock a
bull, and under the bull a huge fish, and under the fish a mighty
ocean.”<a id="r532"></a><a href="#f532" class="c011"><sup>[532]</sup></a> God once told Isa (with whom be peace!) of this fish, and
he said, “O Lord show me the fish, that I may look upon it.” So
the Almighty commanded an angel to take Isa and show him the
fish. Accordingly, he took him up and carried him (with whom
be peace!) to the sea, wherein the fish dwelt, and said, “Look, O
Isa, upon the fish.” He looked but at first saw nothing, when,
suddenly, the fish darted past like lightning. At this sight Isa
<span class="pageno" id="Page_324">324</span>fell down a-swoon, and when he came to himself, Allah spake to
him by inspiration, saying, “O Isa, hast thou seen the fish and
comprehended its length and its breadth?” He replied, “By Thy
honour and glory, O Lord, I saw no fish; but there passed me by
a great bull, whose length was three days’ journey, and I know
not what manner of thing this bull is.” Quoth Allah, “O Isa, this
that thou sawest and which was three days in passing by thee, was
but the head of the fish;<a id="r533"></a><a href="#f533" class="c011"><sup>[533]</sup></a> and know that every day I create forty
fishes like unto this.” And Isa hearing this marvelled at the
power of Allah the Almighty. Asked Bulukiya, “What hath Allah
made beneath this sea which containeth the fish?”; and the Angel
answered, “Under the sea the Lord created a vast abyss of air,
under the air fire, and under the fire a mighty serpent, by name
Falak; and were it not for fear of the Most Highest, this serpent
would assuredly swallow up all that is above it, air and fire and
the Angel and his burden, without sensing it.”——And Shahrazad

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the angel
said to Bulukiya when describing the serpent, “And were it not
for fear of the Most Highest, this serpent would assuredly swallow
up all that is above it, air, and fire, and the Angel and his burden,
without sensing it. When Allah created this serpent He said to
it by inspiration:—I will give thee somewhat to keep for me, so
open thy mouth. The serpent replied:—Do whatso Thou wilt;
and opened his mouth and God placed Hell into his maw, saying:—Keep
it until the Day of Resurrection. When that time comes,
the Almighty will send His angels with chains to bring Hell and
bind it until the Day when all men shall meet; and the Lord will
order Hell to go open its gates and there will issue therefrom
sparks bigger than the mountains.” When Bulukiya heard these
things he wept with sore weeping and, taking leave of the Angel,
fared on westwards, till he came in sight of two creatures sitting
before a great shut gate. As he drew near, he saw that one of
the gatekeepers had the semblance of a lion and the other that of
a bull; so he saluted them and they returned his salam and enquired
<span class="pageno" id="Page_325">325</span>who and whence he was and whither he was bound. Quoth he, “I
am of the sons of Adam, a wanderer for the love of Mohammed
(whom Allah assain and save!) and I have strayed from my
way.” Then he asked them what they were and what was the
gate before which they sat, and they answered, “We are the
guardians of this gate thou seest and we have no other business
than the praise and hallowing of Allah and the invocation of
blessings on Mohammed (whom may He bless and keep!).” Bulukiya
wondered and asked them, “What is within the gate?”;
and they answered, “We wot not.” Then quoth he, “I conjure
you, by the truth of your glorious Lord, open to me the gate,
that I may see that which is therein.” Quoth they, “We cannot,
and none may open this gate, of all created beings save Gabriel,
the Faithful One, with whom be peace!” Then Bulukiya lifted up
his voice in supplication to Allah, saying, “O Lord, send me thy
messenger Gabriel, the Faithful One, to open for me this gate that
I may see what be therein;” and the Almighty gave ear unto his
prayer and commanded the Archangel to descend to earth and
open to him the gate of the Meeting-place of the Two Seas. So
Gabriel descended and, saluting Bulukiya, opened the gate to him,
saying, “Enter this door, for Allah commandeth me to open to
thee.” So he entered and Gabriel locked the gate behind him
and flew back to heaven. When Bulukiya found himself within
the gate, he looked and beheld a vast ocean, half salt and half
fresh, bounded on every side by mountain-ranges of red ruby
whereon he saw angels singing the praises of the Lord and hallowing
Him. So he went up to them and saluted them and
having received a return of his salam, questioned them of the sea
and the mountains. Replied they, “This place is situate under
the Arsh or empyreal heaven; and this Ocean causeth the flux
and flow of all the seas of the world; and we are appointed to
distribute them and drive them to the various parts of the earth,
the salt to the salt and the fresh to the fresh,<a id="r534"></a><a href="#f534" class="c011"><sup>[534]</sup></a> and this is our
employ until the Day of Doom. As for the mountain-ranges
they serve to limit and to contain the waters. But thou, whence
comest thou and whither art thou bound?” So he told them his
story and asked them of the road. They bade him traverse the
surface of the ocean which lay before him: so he anointed his
feet with the juice of the herb he had with him, and taking leave
<span class="pageno" id="Page_326">326</span>of the angels, set out upon the face of the sea and sped on over
the water nights and days; and as he was faring, behold, he met a
handsome youth journeying along like himself, whereupon he
greeted him and he returned his greeting. After they parted he
espied four great Angels wayfaring over the face of the sea, and
their going was like the blinding lightning; so he stationed
himself in their road, and when they came up to him, he saluted
them and said to them, “I ask you by the Almighty, the Glorious,
to tell me your names and whither are ye bound?” Replied the
first Angel, “My name is Gabriel and these my companions are
called Isráfíl and Míká’íl and Azrá’íl. There hath appeared in
the East a mighty dragon, which hath laid waste a thousand
cities and devoured their inhabitants; wherefore Allah Almighty
hath commanded us to go to him and seize him and cast him
into Jahannam.” Bulukiya marvelled at the vastness of their

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bulukiya
landed on the island and walked about for a while, till he saw a
comely young man with light shining from his visage, sitting
weeping and lamenting between two built tombs. So he saluted
him and he returned his salutation, and Bulukiya said to him,
“Who art thou and what are these two built tombs between
which thou sittest, and wherefore this wailing?” He looked at
him and wept with sore weeping, till he drenched his clothes
with his tears; then said, “Know thou, O my brother, mine is a
marvellous story and a wondrous; but I would have thee sit
by me and first tell me thy name and thine adventures and who
thou art and what brought thee hither; after which I will, in
turn, relate to thee my history.” So Bulukiya sat down by him
and related to him all that had befallen him from his father’s
death,<a id="r535"></a><a href="#f535" class="c011"><sup>[535]</sup></a> adding, “Such is my history, the whole of it, and Allah
<span class="pageno" id="Page_327">327</span>alone knoweth what will happen to me after this.” When the
youth heard his story, he sighed and said, “O thou unhappy!
How few things thou hast seen in thy life compared with mine!
Know, O Bulukiya, that unlike thyself I have looked upon our
lord Solomon, in his life, and have seen things past count or
reckoning. Indeed, my story is strange and my case out of
range, and I would have thee abide with me, till I tell thee my
history and acquaint thee how I come to be sitting here.”
Hearing this much Hasib again interrupted the Queen of the
Serpents and said to her, “Allah upon thee, O Queen, release
me and command one of thy servants carry me forth to the
surface of the earth, and I will swear an oath to thee that I
will never enter the Hammam-bath as long as I live.” But she
said, “This is a thing which may not be nor will I believe thee
upon thine oath.” When he heard this, he wept and all the
serpents wept on his account and took to interceding for him
with their Queen, saying, “We beseech thee, bid one of us carry
him forth to the surface of the earth, and he will swear thee an
oath never to enter the bath his life long.” Now when Yamlaykhá
(for such was the Queen’s name) heard their appeal, she turned to
Hasib and made him swear to her an oath; after which she bade
a serpent carry him forth to the surface of the earth. The serpent
made ready, but as she was about to go away with him, he turned
to Queen Yamlaykha and said, “I would fain have thee tell me
the history of the youth whom Bulukiya saw sitting between two
tombs.” So she said:—Know, O Hasib, that when Bulukiya sat
down by the youth and told him his tale, from first to last, in
order that the other might also recount his adventures and
explain the cause of his sitting between the two tombs——And

  <h3 id="c329" class="c014"><em>THE STORY OF JANSHAH.</em><a id="r536"></a><a href="#f536" class="c011"><sup>[536]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class="c015">Know, O my brother, that my sire was a King called Teghmús,
who reigned over the land of Kabul and the Banu Shahlán, ten
thousand warlike chiefs, each ruling over a hundred walled cities
and a hundred citadels; and he was suzerain also over seven
vassal princes, and tribute was brought to him from the broad
lands between East and West. He was just and equitable in
his rule and Allah Almighty had given him all this and had
bestowed on him such mighty empire, yet had He not vouchsafed
him a son (though this was his dearest wish) to inherit the
kingdom after his decease. So one day it befel that he summoned
the Olema and astrologers, the mathematicians and
almanac-makers, and said, “Draw me my horoscope and look
if Allah will grant me a son to succeed me.” Accordingly, they
consulted their books and calculated his dominant star and the
aspects thereof; after which they said to him, “Know, O King,
that thou shalt be blessed with a son, but by none other than the
daughter of the King of Khorásán.” Hearing this Teghmus joyed
with exceeding joy and, bestowing on the astrologers and wizards
treasure beyond numbering or reckoning, dismissed them. His
chief Wazir was a renowned warrior, by name ‘Ayn Zár, who was
equal to a thousand cavaliers in battle; so him he summoned
and, repeating to him what the astrologers had predicted, he
said, “O Wazir, it is my will that thou equip thee for a march
to Khorasan and demand for me the hand of its King Bahrwán’s
daughter.” Receiving these orders the Wazir at once proceeded
to get ready for the journey and encamped without the town
with his troops and braves and retinue, whilst King Teghmus
made ready as presents for the King of Khorasan fifteen hundred
loads of silks and precious stones, pearls and rubies and other
gems, besides gold and silver; and he also prepared a prodigious
quantity of all that goeth to the equipment of a bride; then,
loading them upon camels and mules, delivered them to Ayn Zar,
with a letter to the following purport. “After invoking the
blessing of Heaven, King Teghmus to King Bahrwan, greeting.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_329">329</span>Know that we have taken counsel with the astrologers and sages
and mathematicians, and they tell us that we shall have boon of
a boy-child, and that by none other than thy daughter. Wherefore
I have despatched unto thee my Wazir Ayn Zar, with great
store of bridal gear, and I have appointed him to stand in my
stead and to enter into the marriage-contract in my name.
Furthermore I desire that of thy favour thou wilt grant him his
request without stay or delay; for it is my own, and all graciousness
thou showest him, I take for myself; but beware of crossing
me in this, for know, O King Bahrwan, that Allah hath bestowed
upon me the Kingdom of Kabul, and hath given me dominion
over the Banu Shahlan and vouchsafed me a mighty empire; and
if I marry thy daughter, we will be, I and thou, as one thing in
kingship; and I will send thee every year as much treasure as will
suffice thee. And this is my desire of thee.” Then King Teghmus
sealed the letter with his own ring and gave it to the Wazir, who
departed with a great company and journeyed till he drew near
the capital of Khorasan. When King Bahrwan heard of his
approach, he despatched his principal Emirs to meet him,<a id="r537"></a><a href="#f537" class="c011"><sup>[537]</sup></a> with
a convoy of food and drink and other requisites, including forage
for the steeds. So they fared forth with the train till they met the
Wazir; then, alighting without the city, they exchanged salutations
and abode there, eating and drinking, ten days; at the end
of which time they mounted and rode on into the town, where
they were met by King Bahrwan, who came out to greet the
Wazir of King Teghmus and alighting, embraced him and carried
him to his citadel. Then Ayn Zar brought out the presents
and laid them before King Bahrwan, together with the letter of
King Teghmus, which when the King read and understood, he
joyed with joy exceeding and welcomed the Wazir, saying,
“Rejoice in winning thy wish; and know that if King Teghmus
sought of me my life, verily I would give it to him.” Then he
went in forthright to his daughter and her mother and his kinsfolk,
and acquainting them with the King of Kabul’s demand,
sought counsel of them, and they said, “Do what seemeth good to
thee.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Bahrwan consulted his daughter and her mother and his kinsfolk
and they said, “Do what seemeth good to thee.” So he
returned straightway to the Minister Ayn Zar and notified to
him that his desire had been fulfilled; and the Wazir abode
with him two months, at the end of which time he said to him,
“We beseech thee to bestow upon us that wherefore we came, so
we may depart to our own land.” “I hear and obey,” answered
the King. Then he prepared all the gear wanted for the wedding;
and when this was done he assembled his Wazirs and all his
Emirs and the Grandees of his realm and the monks and priests
who tied the knot of marriage between his daughter and King
Teghmus by proxy. And King Bahrwan bade decorate the city
after the goodliest fashion and spread the streets with carpets.
Then he equipped his daughter for the journey and gave her all
manner of presents and rarities and precious metals, such as none
may describe; and Ayn Zar departed with the Princess to his own
country. When the news of their approach reached King Teghmus,
he bade celebrate the wedding festivities and adorn the city; after
which he went in unto the Princess and abated her maidenhead;
nor was it long before she conceived by him and, accomplishing her
months, bare a man-child like the moon on the night of its full.
When King Teghmus knew that his wife had given birth to a
goodly son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and, summoning the
sages and astrologers and mathematicians, said to them, “I
would that ye draw the horoscope of the new-born child with
his ascendant and its aspects and acquaint me what shall befal
him in his lifetime.” So they made their calculations and found
them favourable; but, that he would, in his fifteenth year, be
exposed to perils and hardships, and that if he survived, he
would be happy and fortunate and become a greater king than
his father and a more powerful. The King rejoiced greatly in
this prediction and named the boy Janshah. Then he delivered
him to the nurses, wet and dry, who reared him excellently well
till he reached his fifth year, when his father taught him to read
the Evangel and instructed him in the art of arms and lunge of
lance and sway of sword, so that in less than seven years he was
wont to ride a-hunting, and a-chasing; he became a doughty champion,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_331">331</span>perfect in all the science of the cavalarice and his father
was delighted to hear of his knightly prowess. It chanced one
day that King Teghmus and his son accompanied by the troops
rode out for sport into the wolds and wilds and hunted till mid-afternoon
of the third day, when the Prince started a gazelle of a
rare colour, which fled before him. So he gave chase to it, followed
by seven of King Teghmus’s white slaves all mounted on
swift steeds, and rode at speed after the gazelle, which fled before
them till she brought them to the sea-shore. They all ran at her
to take her as their quarry, but she escaped from them and, throwing
herself into the waves,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Janshah and the Mamelukes ran at the gazelle, to take her as
their quarry, she escaped from them and, throwing herself into
the waves, swam out to a fishing bark, that was moored near the
shore, and sprang on board. Janshah and his followers dismounted
and, boarding the boat, made prize of the gazelle and were minded
to return to shore with her, when the Prince espied a great island
in the offing and said to his merry men, “I have a longing to visit
yonder island.” They answered, “We hear and obey,” and sailed
on till they came to the island, where they landed and amused
themselves with exploring the place. Then they again embarked
and taking with them the gazelle, set out to return homeward, but
the murk of evening overtook them and they missed their way on
the main. Moreover a strong wind arose and drave the boat into
mid-ocean, so that when they awoke in the morning, they found
themselves lost at sea. Such was their case; but as regards
King Teghmus, when he missed his son, he commanded his
troops to make search for him in separate bodies; so they dispersed
on all sides and a company of them, coming to the sea-shore,
found there the Prince’s white slave whom he had left in
charge of the horses. They asked him what was come of his
master and the other six, and he told them what had passed;
whereupon they took him with them and returned to the King and
acquainted him with what they had learnt. When Teghmus heard
their report, he wept with sore weeping and cast the crown from his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_332">332</span>head, biting his hands for vexation. Then he rose forthright and
wrote letters and despatched them to all the islands of the sea.
Moreover he got together an hundred ships and filling them with
troops, sent them to sail about in quest of Janshah, while he himself
withdrew with his troops to his capital, where he abode in
sore concern. As for Janshah’s mother, when she heard of his loss
she buffeted her face and began the mourning ceremonies for her
son making sure that he was dead. Meanwhile, Janshah and his
men ceased not driving before the wind and those in search of
them cruised about for ten days till, finding no trace they returned
and reported failure to the King. But a stiff gale caught the
Prince’s craft which went spooning till they made a second island,
where they landed and walked about. Presently they came upon
a spring of running water in the midst of the island and saw from
afar a man sitting hard by it. So they went up to him and
saluted him, and he returned their salam, speaking in a voice like
the whistle<a id="r538"></a><a href="#f538" class="c011"><sup>[538]</sup></a> of birds. Whilst Janshah stood marvelling at the
man’s speech he looked right and left and suddenly split himself
in twain, and each half went a different way.<a id="r539"></a><a href="#f539" class="c011"><sup>[539]</sup></a> Then there came
down from the hills a multitude of men of all kinds, beyond count
and reckoning; and they no sooner reached the spring, than each
one divided into two halves and rushed on Janshah and his
Mamelukes to eat them. When the voyagers saw this, they turned
and fled seawards; but the cannibals pursued them and caught
and ate three of the slaves, leaving only three slaves who with
Janshah reached the boat in safety; then launching her made for
the water and sailed nights and days without knowing whither
their ship went. They killed the gazelle and lived on her flesh,
till the winds drove them to a third island which was full of trees
and waters and flower-gardens and orchards laden with all fashion
of fruits: and streams strayed under the tree-shade: brief, the
place was a Garden of Eden. The island pleased the Prince and
he said to his companions, “Which of you will land and explore.”
Then said one of the slaves, “That will I do”; but he replied,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_333">333</span>“This thing may not be; you must all land and explore the
place while I abide in the boat.” So he set them ashore,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Prince
set them ashore, and they searched the island, East and West, but
found no one; then they fared on inland to the heart thereof, till
they came to a Castle compassed about with ramparts of white
marble, within which was a palace of the clearest crystal and, set in
its centre a garden containing all manner fruits beyond description,
both fresh and dry, and flowers of grateful odour and trees
and birds singing upon the boughs. Amiddlemost the garden was
a vast basin of water, and beside it a great open hall with a raised
dais whereon stood a number of stools surrounding a throne of
red gold, studded with all kinds of jewels and especially rubies.
Seeing the beauty of the Castle and of the Garden they entered
and explored in all directions, but found no one there, so after
rummaging the Castle they returned to Janshah and told him what
they had seen. When he heard their report, he cried, “Needs
must I solace myself with a sight of it;” so he landed and
accompanied them to the palace, which he entered marvelling at
the goodliness of the place. They then visited every part of the
gardens and ate of the fruits and continued walking till it waxed
dark, when they returned to the estrade and sat down, Janshah on
the throne in the centre and the three others on the stools ranged
to the right and left. Then the Prince, there seated, called to mind
his separation from his father’s throne-city<a id="r540"></a><a href="#f540" class="c011"><sup>[540]</sup></a> and country and friends
and kinsfolk; and fell a-weeping and lamenting over their loss,
whilst his men wept around him. And as they were thus sorrowing
behold, they heard a mighty clamour, that came from seaward,
and looking in the direction of the clamour saw a multitude of
apes, as they were swarming locusts. Now the castle and the
island belonged to these apes, who, finding the strangers’ boat
moored to the strand, had scuttled it and after repaired to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_334">334</span>palace, where they came upon Janshah and his men seated. Here
the Serpent-queen again broke off her recital saying, “All this, O
Hasib, was told to Bulukiya by the young man sitting between the
two tombs.” Quoth Hasib, “And what did Janshah with the
apes?”; so the Queen resumed her tale:—He and his men were
sore affrighted at the appearance of the apes, but a company of
them came up to the throne whereon he sat and, kissing the earth
before him, stood awhile in his presence with their paws upon their
breasts in posture of respect. Then another troop brought to the
castle gazelles which they slaughtered and skinned; and roasting
pieces of the flesh till fit for food they laid them on platters of
gold and silver and spreading the table, made signs to Janshah
and his men to eat. The Prince and his followers came down from
their seats and ate, and the apes ate with them, till they were
satisfied, when the apes took away the meat and set on fruits of
which they partook and praised Allah the most Highest. Then
Janshah asked the apes by signs what they were and to whom the
palace belonged, and they answered him by signals, “Know ye that
this island belonged of yore to our lord Solomon son of David
(on both of whom be peace!), and he used to come hither once
every year for his solace,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Janshah asked the apes by signs to whom the palace belonged,
they answered him by signals, “Of a truth this place belonged of
yore to our lord Solomon son of David (on both of whom be
peace!), who used to come hither once every year for his solace,
and then wend his ways.” Presently the apes continued, “And
know, O King, that thou art become our Sultan and we are thy
servants; so eat and drink, and whatso thou ever bid us, that will
we do.” So saying, they severally kissed the earth between the
hands of Janshah and all took their departure. The Prince slept
that night on the throne and his men on the stools about him, and
on the morrow, at daybreak, the four Wazirs or Captains of the
apes presented themselves before him, attended by their troops,
who ranged themselves about him, rank after rank, until the place
was crowded. Then the Wazirs approached and exhorted him by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_335">335</span>signs to do justice amongst them and rule them righteously; after
which the apes cried out to one another and went away, all save
a small party which remained in presence to serve him. After
awhile, there came up a company of apes with huge dogs in the
semblance of horses, each wearing about his head a massive
chain; and signed to Janshah and his three followers to mount
and go with them. So they mounted, marvelling at the greatness
of the dogs, and rode forth, attended by the four Wazirs and a
host of apes like swarming locusts, some riding on dogs and
others afoot till they came to the sea-shore. Janshah looked for
the boat which brought him and finding it scuttled turned to the
Wazirs and asked how this had happened to it; whereto they
answered, “Know, O King, that, when thou camest to our island,
we kenned that thou wouldst be Sultan over us and we feared lest
ye all flee from us, in our absence; and embark in the boat; so
we sank it.” When Janshah heard this, he turned to his Mamelukes
and said to them, “We have no means of escaping from
these apes, and we must patiently await the ordinance of the
Almighty.” Then they fared on inland and ceased not faring till
they came to the banks of a river, on whose other side rose a high
mountain, whereon Janshah saw a multitude of Ghuls. So he
turned to the apes and asked them, “What are these Ghuls?” and
they answered, “Know, O King, that these Ghuls are our mortal
foes and we come hither to do battle with them.” Janshah
marvelled to see them riding horses, and was startled at the vastness
of their bulk and the strangeness of their semblance; for
some of them had heads like bulls and others like camels. As soon
as the Ghuls espied the army of the apes, they charged down to
the river·bank and standing there, fell to pelting them with stones
as big as maces; and between them there befel a sore fight.
Presently, Janshah, seeing that the Ghuls were getting the better
of the apes, cried out to his men, saying, “Uncase your bows and
arrows and shoot at them your best shafts and keep them off
from us.” They did so and slew of the Ghuls much people, when
there fell upon them sore dismay and they turned to flee; but the
apes, seeing Janshah’s prowess, forded the river and headed by
their Sultan chased the Ghuls, killing many of them in the
pursuit, till they reached the high mountain where they disappeared.
And while exploring the said mountain Janshah
found a tablet of alabaster, whereon was written, “O thou who
enterest this land, know that thou wilt become Sultan over these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_336">336</span>apes and that from them there is no escape for thee, except by
the passes that run east and west through the mountains. If
thou take the eastern pass, thou wilt fare through a country
swarming with Ghuls and wild beasts, Marids and Ifrits, and thou
wilt come, after three months’ journeying, to the ocean which
encompasseth the earth; but, if thou travel by the western pass,
it will bring thee, after four months’ journeying, to the head of
the Wady of Emmets.<a id="r541"></a><a href="#f541" class="c011"><sup>[541]</sup></a> When thou hast followed the road, that
leads through this mountain, ten days,”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah
read this much upon the tablet and found, at the end of the
inscription, “Then thou wilt come to a great river, whose current
is so swift that it blindeth the eyes. Now this river drieth up
every Sabbath,<a id="r542"></a><a href="#f542" class="c011"><sup>[542]</sup></a> and on the opposite bank lies a city wholly inhabited
by Jews, who the faith of Mohammed refuse; there is not
a Moslem among the band nor is there other than this city in the
land. Better therefore lord it over the apes, for so long as thou
shalt tarry amongst them they will be victorious over the Ghuls.
And know also that he who wrote this tablet was the lord
Solomon, son of David (on both be peace!).” When Janshah
read these words, he wept sore and repeated them to his men.
Then they mounted again and, surrounded by the army of the
apes who were rejoicing in their victory, returned to the castle.
Here Janshah abode, Sultaning over them, for a year and a half.
And at the end of this time, he one day commanded the ape-army
to mount and go forth a-hunting with him, and they rode out into
the wolds and wilds, and fared on from place to place, till they
approached the Wady of Emmets, which Janshah knew by the
description of it upon the alabaster tablet. Here he bade them
dismount and they all abode there, eating and drinking a space of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_337">337</span>ten days, after which Janshah took his men apart one night and
said, “I purpose we flee through the Valley of Emmets and make
for the town of the Jews; it may be Allah will deliver us from
these apes and we will go God’s ways.” They replied, “We hear
and we obey:” so he waited till some little of the night was spent,
then, donning his armour and girding his sword and dagger and
such like weapons, and his men doing likewise, they set out and
fared on westwards till morning. When the apes awoke and
missed Janshah and his men, they knew that they had fled. So
they mounted and pursued them, some taking the eastern pass
and others that which led to the Wady of Emmets, nor was it
long before the apes came in sight of the fugitives, as they were
about to enter the valley, and hastened after them. When Janshah
and his men saw them, they fled into the Emmet-valley; but the
apes soon overtook them and would have slain them, when behold,
there rose out of the earth a multitude of ants like swarming
locusts, as big as dogs, and charged home upon the apes. They
devoured many of their foes, and these also slew many of the ants;
but help came to the emmets: now an ant would go up to an ape
and smite him and cut him in twain, whilst ten apes could hardly
master one ant and bear him away and tear him in sunder. The
sore battle lasted till the evening but the emmets were victorious.
In the gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along
the sole of the Wady——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that in the
gloaming Janshah and his men took to flight and fled along the
sole of the Wady till the morning. With the break of day, the
apes were up and at them, which when the Prince saw, he shouted
to his men, “Smite with your swords.” So they bared their
blades and laid on load right and left, till there ran at them an
ape, with tusks like an elephant, and smote one of the Mamelukes
and cut him in sunder. Then the apes redoubled upon
Janshah and he fled with his followers into the lower levels of the
valley, where he saw a vast river and by its side a mighty many of
ants. When the emmets espied Janshah they pushed on and
surrounded him, and one of the slaves fell to smiting them with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_338">338</span>his sword and cutting them in twain; whereupon the whole host
set upon him and slew him. At this pass, behold, up came the
apes from over the mountain and fell in numbers upon Janshah;
but he tore off his clothes and, plunging into the river, with his
remaining servant, struck out for the middle of the stream. Presently,
he caught sight of a tree on the other bank; so he swam
up to it and laying hold of one of its branches, hung to it and
swung himself ashore, but as for the last Mameluke the current
carried him away and dashed him to pieces against the mountain.
Thereupon Janshah fell to wringing his clothes and spreading them
in the sun to dry, what while there befel a fierce fight between the
apes and the ants, until the apes gave up the pursuit and returned
to their own land. Meanwhile, Janshah, who abode alone on the
river-bank, could do naught but shed tears till nightfall, when he
took refuge in a cavern and there passed the dark hours, in great
fear and feeling desolate for the loss of his slaves. At daybreak
awaking from his sleep he set out again and fared on nights
and days, eating of the herbs of the earth, till he came to the
mountain which burnt like fire, and thence he made the river
which dried up every Sabbath. Now it was a mighty stream
and on the opposite bank stood a great city, which was the
capital of the Jews mentioned in the tablet. Here he abode till
the next Sabbath, when the river dried up and he walked over
to the other side and entered the Jew city, but saw none in the
streets. So he wandered about till he came to the door of a
homestead, which he opened and entering, espied within the people
of the house sitting in silence and speaking not a syllable.
Quoth he, “I am a stranger and anhungered;” and they signed
to him, as to say, “Eat and drink, but speak not.”<a id="r543"></a><a href="#f543" class="c011"><sup>[543]</sup></a> So he ate
and drank and slept that night and, when morning dawned, the
master of the house greeted him and bade him welcome and asked
him, “Whence comest thou and whither art thou bound?” At
these words Janshah wept sore and told him all that had befallen
him and how his father was King of Kabul; whereat the Jew
marvelled and said, “Never heard we of that city, but we have
heard from the merchants of the caravans that in that direction
lieth a land called Al-Yaman.” “How far is that land from this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_339">339</span>place?” asked Janshah, and the Jew answered, “The Cafilah merchants
pretend that it is a two years and three months’ march from
their land hither.” Quoth Janshah, “And when doth the caravan
come?” Quoth the Jew, “Next year ‘twill come.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Jew was questioned anent the coming of the caravan, he replied,
“Next year ‘twill come.” At these words the Prince wept sore
and fell a-sorrowing for himself and his Mamelukes; and lamenting
his separation from his mother and father and all which had
befallen him in his wanderings. Then said the Jew, “O young
man, do not weep, but sojourn with us till the caravan shall come,
when we will send thee with it to thine own country.” So he
tarried with the Jew two whole months and every day he went out
walking in the streets for his solace and diversion. Now it chanced
one day, whilst he paced about the main thoroughfares, as of wont,
and was bending his steps right and left, he heard a crier crying
aloud and saying, “Who will earn a thousand gold pieces and a
slave-girl of surpassing beauty and loveliness by working for me
between morning and noontide?” But no one answered him and
Janshah said in his mind, “Were not this work dangerous and
difficult, he would not offer a thousand dinars and a fair girl for
half a day’s labour.” Then he accosted the crier and said, “I will
do the work;” so the man carried him to a lofty mansion where
they found one who was a Jew and a merchant, seated on an ebony
chair, to whom quoth the crier, standing respectfully before him, “O
merchant, I have cried every day these three months, and none
hath answered, save this young man.” Hearing his speech the Jew
welcomed Janshah, led him into a magnificent sitting-room and
signalled to bring food. So the servants spread the table and set
thereon all manner meats, of which the merchant and Janshah ate,
and washed their hands. Then wine was served up and they
drank; after which the Jew rose and bringing Janshah a purse
of a thousand dinars and a slave-girl of rare beauty, said to him,
“Take maid and money to thy hire.” Janshah took them and
seated the girl by his side when the trader resumed, “To-morrow
<span class="pageno" id="Page_340">340</span>to the work!”; and so saying he withdrew and Janshah slept with
the damsel that night. As soon as it was morning, the merchant
bade his slaves clothe him in a costly suit of silk whenas he came
out of the Hammam-bath. So they did as he bade them and
brought him back to the house, whereupon the merchant called
for harp and lute and wine and they drank and played and made
merry till the half of the night was past, when the Jew retired to
his Harim and Janshah lay with his slave-girl till the dawn. Then
he went to the bath and on his return, the merchant came to him
and said, “Now I wish thee to do the work for me.” “I hear and
obey,” replied Janshah. So the merchant bade his slaves bring
two she-mules and set Janshah on one, mounting the other himself.
Then they rode forth from the city and fared on from morn
till noon, when they made a lofty mountain, to whose height was
no limit. Here the Jew dismounted, ordering Janshah to do the
same; and when he obeyed the merchant gave him a knife and
a cord, saying, “I desire that thou slaughter this mule.” So
Janshah tucked up his sleeves and skirts and going up to the
mule, bound her legs with the cord, then threw her and cut her
throat; after which he skinned her and lopped off her head and
legs and she became a mere heap of flesh. Then said the Jew,
“Slit open the mule’s belly and enter it and I will sew it up on
thee. There must thou abide awhile and whatsoever thou seest
in her belly, acquaint me therewith.” So Janshah slit the mule’s
belly and crept into it, whereupon the merchant sewed it up on
him and withdrew to a distance,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant
sewed up the mule’s belly on Janshah and, withdrawing to
a distance, hid himself in the skirts of the mountain. After a
while a huge bird swooped down on the dead mule and snatching
it up, flew up with it to the top of the mountain, where it set down
the quarry and would have eaten it; but Janshah, feeling the bird
begin to feed, slit the mule’s belly and came forth. When the
bird saw him, it took fright at him and flew right away; whereupon
he stood up and looking right and left, saw nothing but the
carcasses of dead men, mummied by the sun, and exclaimed,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_341">341</span>“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” Then he looked down the precipice and
espied the merchant standing at the mountain-foot, looking for
him. As soon as the Jew caught sight of him, he called out to
him, “Throw me down of the stones which are about thee, that
I may direct thee to a way whereby thou mayst descend.” So
Janshah threw him down some two hundred of the stones, which
were all rubies,<a id="r544"></a><a href="#f544" class="c011"><sup>[544]</sup></a> chrysolites and other gems of price; after which
he called out to him, saying, “Show me the way down and I will
throw thee as many more.” But the Jew gathered up the stones
and, binding them on the back of the mule, went his way without
answering a word and left Janshah alone on the mountain-top.
When the Prince found himself deserted, he began to weep and
implore help of Heaven, and thus he abode three days; after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_342">342</span>which he rose and fared on over the mountainous ground two
month’s space, feeding upon hill-herbs; and he ceased not faring
till he came to its skirts and espied afar off a Wady full of fruitful
trees and birds harmonious singing the praises of Allah, the One,
the Victorious. At this sight he joyed with great joy and stayed
not his steps till, after an hour or so, he came to a ravine in the
rocks, through which the rain-torrents fell into the valley. He
made his way down the cleft till he reached the Wady which he
had seen from the mountain-top and walked on therein, gazing
right and left, nor ceased so doing until he came in sight of a
great castle, towering high in air. As he drew near the gates
he saw an old man of comely aspect and face shining with light
standing thereat with a staff of carnelian in his hand, and going
up to him, saluted him. The Shaykh returned his salam and
bade him welcome, saying, “Sit down, O my son.” So he sat
down at the door of the castle and the old man said to him,
“How camest thou to this land, untrodden by son of Adam
before thee, and whither art thou bound?” When Janshah
heard his words he wept bitterly at the thought of all the hardships
he had suffered and his tears choked his speech. Quoth
the Shaykh, “O my son, leave weeping; for indeed thou makest
my heart ache.” So saying, he rose and set somewhat of food
before him and said to him, “Eat.” He ate and praised Allah
Almighty; after which the old man besought him saying, “O
my son, I would have thee tell me thy tale and acquaint me
with thine adventures.” So Janshah related to him all that had
befallen him, from first to last, whereat the Shaykh marvelled
with exceeding marvel. Then said the Prince, “Prithee inform
me who is the lord of this valley and to whom doth this great
castle belong?” Answered the old man, “Know, O my son,
this valley and all that is therein and this castle with all it
containeth belong to the lord Solomon, son of David (on both
be peace!). As for me, my name is Shaykh Nasr,<a id="r545"></a><a href="#f545" class="c011"><sup>[545]</sup></a> King of the
Birds; for thou must know that the lord Solomon committed
this castle to my charge,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shaykh
Nasr pursued, “Thou must know that the lord Solomon committed
this castle to my charge and taught me the language of
birds and made me ruler over all the fowls which be in the world;
wherefore each and every come hither once in the twelvemonth,
and I pass them in review: then they depart; and this is why
I dwell here.” When Janshah heard this, he wept sore and said
to the Shaykh, “O my father, how shall I do to get back to my
native land?” Replied the old man, “Know, O my son, that
thou art near to the mountain Kaf, and there is no departing
for thee from this place till the birds come, when I will give thee
in charge to one of them, and he will bear thee to thy native
country. Meanwhile tarry with me here and eat and drink and
divert thyself with viewing the apartments of this castle.” So
Janshah abode with Shaykh Nasr, taking his pleasure in the
Wady and eating of its fruits and laughing and making merry
with the old man, and leading a right joyous life till the day
appointed for the birds to pay their annual visit to their Governor.
Thereupon the Shaykh said to him, “O Janshah, take the keys of
the castle and solace thyself with exploring all its apartments and
viewing whatever be therein, but as regards such a room, beware
and again beware of opening its door; and if thou gainsay me
and open it and enter therethrough nevermore shalt thou know
fair fortune.” He repeated this charge again and again with much
instance; then he went forth to meet the birds, which came up,
kind by kind, and kissed his hands. Such was his case; but as
regards Janshah, he went round about the castle, opening the
various doors and viewing the apartments into which they led,
till he came to the room which Shaykh Nasr had warned him
not to open or enter. He looked at the door and its fashion
pleased him, for it had on it a padlock of gold, and he said to
himself, “This room must be goodlier than all the others; would
Heaven I wist what is within it, that Shaykh Nasr should forbid
me to open its door! There is no help but that I enter and see
what is in this apartment; for whatso is decreed unto the creature
perforce he must fulfil.” So he put out his hand and unlocked
the door and entering, found himself before a great basin; and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_344">344</span>hard by it stood a little pavilion, builded all of gold and silver
and crystal, with lattice-windows of jacinth. The floor was paved
with green beryl and balass rubies and emeralds and other jewels,
set in the ground-work mosaic-fashion, and in the midmost of the
pavilion was a jetting fountain in a golden basin, full of water
and girt about with figures of beasts and birds, cunningly wrought
of gold and silver and casting water from their mouths. When
the zephyr blew on them, it entered their ears and therewith the
figures sang out with birdlike song, each in its own tongue. Beside
the fountain was a great open saloon with a high daïs whereon
stood a vast throne of carnelian, inlaid with pearls and jewels,
over which was spread a tent of green silk fifty cubits in width
and embroidered with gems fit for seal-rings and purfled with
precious metals. Within this tent was a closet containing the
carpet of the lord Solomon (on whom be peace!); and the pavilion
was compassed about with a vast garden full of fruit-trees and
streams; while near the palace were beds of roses and basil and
eglantine and all manner sweet-smelling herbs and flowers. And
the trees bore on the same boughs fruits fresh and dry and the
branches swayed gracefully to the wooing of the wind. All this
was in that one apartment and Janshah wondered thereat till he
was weary of wonderment; and he set out to solace himself in the
palace and the garden and to divert himself with the quaint and
curious things they contained. And first looking at the basin
he saw that the gravels of its bed were gems and jewels and
noble metals; and many other strange things were in that apartment.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah
saw many strange things and admirable in that apartment. Then
he entered the pavilion and mounting the throne, fell asleep under
the tent set up thereover. He slept for a time and, presently
awaking, walked forth and sat down on a stool before the door.
As he sat, marvelling at the goodliness of that place, there flew
up from mid-sky three birds, in dove-form but big as eagles, and
lighted on the brink of the basin, where they sported awhile.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_345">345</span>Then they put off their feathers and became three maidens,<a id="r546"></a><a href="#f546" class="c011"><sup>[546]</sup></a> as
they were moons, that had not their like in the whole world. They
plunged into the basin and swam about and disported themselves
and laughed, while Janshah marvelled at their beauty and loveliness
and the grace and symmetry of their shapes. Presently, they
came up out of the water and began walking about and taking
their solace in the garden; and Janshah seeing them land was
like to lose his wits. He rose and followed them, and when he
overtook them, he saluted them and they returned his salam;
after which quoth he, “Who are ye, O illustrious Princesses, and
whence come ye?” Replied the youngest damsel, “We are from
the invisible world of Almighty Allah and we come hither to
divert ourselves.” He marvelled at their beauty and said to the
youngest, “Have ruth on me and deign kindness to me and take
pity on my case and on all that hath befallen me in my life.”
Rejoined she, “Leave this talk and wend thy ways”; whereat the
tears streamed from his eyes, and he sighed heavily and repeated
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She shone out in the garden in garments all of green, ✿ With open vest and collars and flowing hair beseen:</div>
      <div class="line">“What is thy name?” I asked her, and she replied, “I’m she ✿ Who roasts the hearts of lovers on coals of love and teen.”</div>
      <div class="line">Of passion and its anguish to her I made my moan; ✿ “Upon a rock,” she answered, “thy plaints are wasted clean.”</div>
      <div class="line">“Even if thy heart,” I told her, “be rock in very deed, ✿ Yet hath God made fair water well from the rock, I ween.”<a id="r547"></a><a href="#f547" class="c011"><sup>[547]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the maidens heard his verses, they laughed and played and
sang and made merry. Then he brought them somewhat of fruit,
and they ate and drank and slept with him till the morning, when
they donned their feather-suits, and resuming dove shape flew off
and went their way. But as he saw them disappearing from sight,
his reason well-nigh fled with them, and he gave a great cry and
fell down in a fainting fit and lay a-swooning all that day. While
<span class="pageno" id="Page_346">346</span>he was in this case Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of
the Fowls and sought for Janshah, that he might send him with
them to his native land, but found him not and knew that he had
entered the forbidden room. Now he had already said to the birds,
“With me is a young man, a mere youth, whom destiny brought
hither from a distant land; and I desire of you that ye take him
up and carry him to his own country.” And all answered, “We
hear and we obey.” So he ceased not searching for Janshah till
he came to the forbidden door and seeing it open he entered and
found the Prince lying a-swoon under a tree. He fetched scented
waters and sprinkled them on his face, whereupon he revived and
turned——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Shaykh Nasr saw Janshah lying a-swoon under the tree he fetched
him somewhat of scented waters and sprinkled them on his face.
Thereupon he revived and turned right and left, but seeing
none by him save the Shaykh, sighed heavily and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Like fullest moon she shines on happiest night, ✿ Soft-sided fair, with slender shape bedight.</div>
      <div class="line">Her eye-babes charm the world with gramarye; ✿ Her lips remind of rose and ruby light.</div>
      <div class="line">Her jetty locks make night upon her hips; ✿ Ware, lovers, ware ye of that curl’s despight!</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, soft her sides are, but in love her heart ✿ Out-hardens flint, surpasses syenite:</div>
      <div class="line">And bows of eyebrows shower glancey shafts ✿ Despite the distance never fail to smite.</div>
      <div class="line">Then, ah, her beauty! all the fair it passes; ✿ Nor any rival her who see the light.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Shaykh Nasr heard these verses, he said, “O my son, did
I not warn thee not to open that door and enter that room? But
now, O my son, tell me what thou sawest therein and acquaint
me with all that betided thee.” So Janshah related to him all
that had passed between him and the three maidens, and Shaykh
Nasr, who sat listening in silence said, “Know, O my son, that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_347">347</span>these three maidens are of the daughters of the Jann and come
hither every year for a day, to divert themselves and make merry
until mid-afternoon, when they return to their own country.”
Janshah asked, “And where is their country?”; and the old man
answered, “By Allah, O my son, I wot not:” presently adding,
“but now take heart and put away this love from thee and come
with me, that I may send thee to thine own land with the birds.”
When Janshah heard this, he gave a great cry and fell down in a
trance; and presently he came to himself, and said, “O my father,
indeed I care not to return to my native land: all I want is to
foregather with these maidens and know, O my father, that I will
never again name my people, though I die before thee.” Then he
wept and cried, “Enough for me that I look upon the face of her
I love, although it be only once in the year!” And he sighed
deeply and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Would Heaven the Phantom<a id="r548"></a><a href="#f548" class="c011"><sup>[548]</sup></a> spared the friend at night ✿ And would this love for man were ever dight!</div>
      <div class="line">Were not my heart a-fire for love of you, ✿ Tears ne’er had stained my cheeks nor dimmed my sight.</div>
      <div class="line">By night and day, I bid my heart to bear ✿ Its griefs, while fires of love my body blight.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he fell at Shaykh Nasr’s feet and kissed them and wept sore,
crying, “Have pity on me, so Allah take pity on thee and aid me
in my strait so Allah aid thee!” Replied the old man, “By Allah,
O my son, I know nothing of these maidens nor where may be
their country; but, O my son, if thy heart be indeed set on one of
them, tarry with me till this time next year for they will assuredly
reappear; and, when the day of their coming draweth near, hide
thyself under a tree in the garden. As soon as they have alighted
and doffed their feather-robes and plunged into the lake and are
swimming about at a distance from their clothes, seize the vest of
her whom thy soul desireth. When they see thee, they will come
a-bank and she, whose coat thou hast taken, will accost thee and
say to thee with the sweetest of speech and the most witching of
smiles, “Give me my dress, O my brother, that I may don it and
veil my nakedness withal.” But if thou yield to her prayer and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_348">348</span>give her back the vest thou wilt never win thy wish: nay, she will
don it and fly away to her folk and thou wilt nevermore see her
again. Now when thou hast gained the vest, clap it under thine
armpit and hold it fast, till I return from the Parliament of the
Fowls, when I will make accord between thee and her and send
thee back to thy native land, and the maiden with thee. And
this, O my son, is all I can do for thee, nothing more.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Eleventh Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
Shaykh Nasr to Janshah, “Hold fast the feather-robe of her thy
soul desireth and give it not back to her till I return from the
Parliament of the Fowls. And this, O my son, is all I can do for
thee, nothing more.” When Janshah heard this, his heart was
solaced and he abode with Shaykh Nasr yet another year,
counting the days as they passed until the day of the coming of
the birds. And when at last the appointed time arrived the old
man said to him, “Do as I enjoined thee and charged thee with
the maidens in the matter of the feather-dress, for I go to meet
the birds;” and Janshah replied, “I hear and I obey, O my
father.” Then the Shaykh departed whilst the Prince walked
into the garden and hid himself under a tree, where none could
see him. Here he abode a first day and a second and a third, but
the maidens came not; whereat he was sore troubled and wept
and sighed from a heart hard tried; and he ceased not weeping
and wailing till he fainted away. When he came to himself, he
fell to looking now at the basin and now at the welkin, and anon
at the earth and anon at the open country, whilst his heart
grieved for stress of love-longing. As he was in this case,
behold, the three doves appeared in the firmament, eagle-sized as
before, and flew till they reached the garden and lighted down
beside the basin. They turned right and left; but saw no one,
man or Jann; so they doffed their feather-suits and became three
maidens. Then they plunged into the basin and swam about,
laughing and frolicking; and all were mother-naked and fair as
bars of virgin silver. Quoth the eldest, “O my sister, I fear
lest there be some one lying ambushed for us in the pavilion.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_349">349</span>Answered the second, “O sister, since the days of King Solomon,
none hath entered the pavilion, be he man or Jann;” and the
youngest added, laughing, “By Allah, O my sisters, if there be
any hidden there, he will assuredly take none but me.” Then
they continued sporting and laughing and Janshah’s heart kept
fluttering for stress of passion: but he hid behind the tree so
that he saw without being seen. Presently they swam out to the
middle of the basin leaving their clothes on the bank. Hereupon
he sprang to his feet, and running like the darting leven to
the basin’s brink, snatched up the feather-vest of the youngest
damsel, her on whom his heart was set and whose name was
Shamsah the Sun-maiden. At this the girls turned and seeing
him, were affrighted and veiled their shame from him in the water.
Then they swam near shore and looking on his favour saw that
he was bright faced as the moon on the night of fullness
and asked him, “Who art thou and how camest thou hither and
why hast thou taken the clothes of the lady Shamsah?”; and he
answered, “Come hither to me and I will tell you my tale.”
Quoth Shamsah, “What deed is this, and why hast thou taken
my clothes, rather than those of my sisters?” Quoth he, “O
light of mine eyes, come forth of the water, and I will recount thee
my case and acquaint thee why I chose thee out.” Quoth she,
“O my lord and coolth of my eyes and fruit of my heart, give me
my clothes, that I may put them on and cover my nakedness
withal; then will I come forth to thee.” But he replied, “O
Princess of beautiful ones, how can I give thee back thy clothes
and slay myself for love-longing? Verily, I will not give them
to thee, till Shaykh Nasr, the king of the birds, shall return.”
Quoth she, “If thou wilt not give me my clothes withdraw a little
apart from us, that my sisters may land and dress themselves and
lend me somewhat wherewithal to cover my shame.” “I hear
and obey,” answered he, and walked away from them into the
pavilion, whereupon the three Princesses came out and the two
elder, donning their dress, gave Shamsah somewhat thereof, not
enough to fly withal, and she put it on and came forth of the
water, and stood before him, as she were the rising full-moon or a
browsing gazelle. Then Shamsah entered the pavilion, where
Janshah was still sitting on the throne; so she saluted him and
taking seat near him, said, “O fair of face, thou hast undone
thyself and me; but tell us thy adventures that we may ken how
it is with thee.” At these words he wept till he drenched his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_350">350</span>dress with his tears; and when she saw that he was distracted
for love of her, she rose and taking him by the hand, made him
sit by her side and wiped away the drops with her sleeve; and said
she, “O fair of face, leave this weeping and tell us thy tale.” So
he related to her all that had befallen him and described to her all
he had seen,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
lady Shamsah said to Janshah, “Tell us thy tale;” so he related
to her all that had befallen him; and, after she had lent attentive
ear she sighed and said, “O my lord, since thou art so fondly in
love with me, give me my dress, that I may fly to my folk, I and
my sisters, and tell them what affection thou hast conceived for
me, and after I will come back to thee and carry thee to thine
own country.” When he heard this, he wept sore and replied,
“Is it lawful to thee before Allah to slay me wrongfully?” She
asked, “O my lord, why should I do such wrongous deed?”; and
he answered, “If I give thee thy gear thou wilt fly away from
me, and I shall die forthright.” Princess Shamsah laughed at
this and so did her sisters; then said she to him, “Be of good
cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I must needs marry
thee.” So saying, she bent down to him and embraced him and
pressing him to her breast kissed him between the eyes and on
his cheeks. They clipped and clasped each other awhile, after
which they drew apart and sat down on the throne. Then the
eldest Princess went out into the garden and, plucking somewhat
of fruits and flowers, brought them into the pavilion; and they ate
and drank and laughed and sported and made merry. Now
Janshah was singular in beauty and loveliness and slender shape
and symmetry and grace, and the Princess Shamsah said to him,
“O my beloved, by Allah, I love thee with exceeding love and
will never leave thee!” When he heard her words, his breast
broadened and he laughed for joy till he showed his teeth; and
they abode thus awhile in mirth and gladness and frolic. And
when they were at the height of their pleasure and joyance,
behold, Shaykh Nasr returned from the Parliament of the Fowls
and came in to them; whereupon they all rose to him and saluted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_351">351</span>him and kissed his hands. He gave them welcome and bade them
be seated. So they sat down and he said to Princess Shamsah,
“Verily this youth loveth thee with exceeding love; Allah upon
thee, deal kindly with him, for he is of the great ones of mankind
and of the sons of the kings, and his father ruleth over the land of
Kabul and his reign compasseth a mighty empire.” Quoth she, “I
hear and I obey thy behest”; and, kissing the Shaykh’s hands,
stood before him in respect. Quoth he, “If thou say sooth, swear
to me by Allah that thou wilt never betray him, what while thou
abidest in the bonds of life.” So she swore a great oath that she
would never betray Janshah, but would assuredly marry him, and
added, “Know, O Shaykh Nasr, that I never will forsake him.”
The Shaykh believed in her oath and said to Janshah, “Thanks
be to Allah, who hath made you arrive at this understanding!”
Hereupon the Prince rejoiced with exceeding joy, and he and
Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr, feasting and
toying and making merry.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Thirteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, Janshah
and the lady Shamsah abode three months with Shaykh Nasr,
feasting and toying and making merry. And at the end of that
time she said to Janshah, “I wish to go with thee to thy motherland,
where thou shalt marry me and we will abide there.” “To
hear is to obey,” answered he and took counsel with Shaykh Nasr,
who said to him, “Go thou home, I commend her to thy care.”
Then said she, “O Shaykh Nasr, bid him render me my feather-suit.”
So the Shaykh bade Janshah give it to her, and he went
straightways into the pavilion and brought it out for her. Thereupon
she donned it and said to him, “Mount my back and shut
thine eyes and stop thine ears, so thou mayst not hear the roar of
the revolving sphere; and keep fast hold of my feathers, lest thou
fall off.” He did as she bade him and, as she stretched her wings
to fly, Shaykh Nasr said, “Wait a while till I describe to thee the
land Kabul, lest you twain miss your way.” So she delayed till
he had said his say and had bidden them farewell, commending
the Prince to her care. She took leave of her sisters and bade
them return to her folk and tell them what had befallen her with
Janshah; then, rising into the air without stay or delay she flew
<span class="pageno" id="Page_352">352</span>off, like the wafts of the wind or the lamping leven. Her sisters
also took flight and returning home delivered her message to their
people. And she stayed not her course from the forenoon till the
hour of mid-afternoon prayer (Janshah being still on her back),
when she espied afar off a Wady abounding in trees and streams
and<a id="t353"></a> she said to Janshah, “I am thinking to alight in this valley,
that we may solace ourselves amongst its trees and herbage and
here rest for the night.” Quoth he, “Do what seemeth meet to
thee!” So she swooped down from the lift and alighted in the
Wady, when Janshah dismounted and kissing her between the
eyes,<a id="r549"></a><a href="#f549" class="c011"><sup>[549]</sup></a> sat with her awhile on the bank of a river there; then they
rose and wandered about the valley, taking their pleasure therein
and eating of the fruits of the trees, until nightfall, when they
lay down under a tree and slept till the morning dawned. As
soon as it was day, the Princess arose and, bidding Janshah mount,
flew on with him till noon, when she perceived by the appearance
of the buildings which Shaykh Nasr had described to her,
that they were nearing the city Kabul. So she swooped down from
the welkin and alighted in a wide plain, a blooming champaign,
wherein were gazelles straying and springs playing and rivers
flowing and ripe fruits growing. So Janshah dismounted and
kissed her between the eyes; and she asked him, “O my beloved
and coolth of mine eyes, knowest thou how many days’ journey
we have come since yesterday?”; and he answered, “No,” when
she said, “We have come thirty months’ journey.” Quoth he,
“Praised be Allah for safety!” Then they sat down side by side
and ate and drank and toyed and laughed. And whilst they were
thus pleasantly engaged, behold, there came up to them two of the
King’s Mamelukes of those who had been of the Prince’s company;
one of them was he whom he had left with the horses, when
he embarked in the fishing-boat and the other had been of his
escort in the chase. As soon as they saw Janshah, both knew him
and saluted him; then said they, “With thy leave, we will go to
thy sire and bear him the glad tidings of thy coming.” Replied
the Prince, “Go ye to my father and acquaint him with my case, and
fetch us tents, for we will tarry here seven days to rest ourselves
till he make ready his retinue to meet us, that we may enter in
stateliest state.”——And Shahrazad perceived the<a id="he"></a> dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fourteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah
said to the two Mamelukes, “Go ye to my sire and acquaint
him with my case and fetch us tents, for we will abide here seven
days to rest ourselves, till he make ready his retinue to meet us,
that we may enter in the stateliest state.” So the officers hastened
back to King Teghmus and said to him, “Good news, O King of
the age!” Asked he, “What good tidings bring ye: is my son
Janshah come back?”; and they answered, “Yes, thy son Janshah
hath returned from his strangerhood and is now near at hand in
the Kirání mead.” Now when the King heard this, he joyed with
great joy and fell down in a swoon for excess of gladness; then,
coming to himself, he bade his Wazir give each of the Mamelukes
a splendid suit of honour and a sum of money. The minister
replied, “I hear and obey,” and forthright did his bidding and
said to them, “Take this in turn for the good tidings ye bring,
whether ye lie or say sooth.” They replied, “Indeed we lie not,
for but now we sat with him and saluted him and kissed his hands
and he bade us fetch him tents, for that he would sojourn in the
meadow seven days, till such time as the Wazirs and Emirs and
Grandees should come out to meet him.” Quoth the King, “How
is it with my son?” and quoth they, “He hath with him a Houri,
as he had brought her out of Paradise.” At this, King Teghmus
bade beat the kettledrums and sound the trumpets for gladness,
and despatched messengers to announce the good news to Janshah’s
mother and to the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and
Lords of the realm: so the criers spread themselves about the
city and acquainted the people with the coming of Prince Janshah.
Then the King made ready, and, setting out for the Kirani meadow
with his horsemen and footmen, came upon Janshah who was
sitting at rest with the lady Shamsah beside him and, behold, all
suddenly drew in sight. The Prince rose to his feet and walked
forward to meet them; and the troops knew him and dismounted,
to salute him and kiss his hands: after which he set out preceded
by the men in single file till he came to his sire, who, at sight of
his son threw himself from his horse’s back and clasped him to his
bosom and wept flooding tears of joy. Then they took horse again
with the retinue riding to the right and left and fared forward till
they came to the river-banks; when the troops alighted and pitched
<span class="pageno" id="Page_354">354</span>their tents and pavilions and standards to the blare of trump and
the piping of fife and the dub-a-dub of drum and tom-tom.
Moreover the King bade the tent-pitchers set up a pavilion of red
silk for the Princess Shamsah, who put off her scanty raiment of
feathers for fine robes and, entering the pavilion, there took seat.
And as she sat in her beauty, behold, the King and his son Janshah
came in to her, and when she saw Teghmus, she rose and
kissed ground before him. The King sat down and seating Janshah
on his right hand and Princess Shamsah on his left, bade her
welcome and said to his son, “Tell me all that hath befallen thee
in this thy long strangerhood.” So Janshah related to him the
whole of his adventures from first to last, whereat he marvelled with
exceeding marvel and turning to the Princess, said, “Laud to Allah
for that He hath caused thee to reunite me with my son! ‘Verily
this is of His exceeding bounty!’”<a id="r550"></a><a href="#f550" class="c011"><sup>[550]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad perceived

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Fifteenth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Teghmus said to the lady Shamsah, “Laud to Allah for that He
hath caused thee to reunite me with my son! ‘Verily this is of
His exceeding bounty.’ And now I would have thee ask of me
what thou wilt, that I may do it in thine honour.” Quoth she, “I
ask of thee that thou build me a palace in the midst of a flower-garden,
with water running under it.” And the King answered,
“I hear and obey.” And behold, up came Janshah’s mother,
attended by all the wives of the Wazirs and Emirs and nobles and
city notables. When her son had sight of her, he rose and leaving
the tent, went forth to meet her and they embraced a long while,
whilst the Queen wept for excess of joy and with tears trickling
from her eyes repeated the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Joy so o’ercometh me, for stress of joy ✿ In that which gladdeneth me I fain shed tears:—</div>
      <div class="line">Tears are become your nature, O my eyes, ✿ Who weep for joyance as for griefs and fears.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And they complained to each other of all their hearts had suffered
from the long separation. Then the King departed to his pavilion
<span class="pageno" id="Page_355">355</span>and Janshah carried his mother to his own tent, where they sat
talking till there came up some of the lady Shamsah’s attendants
who said, “The Princess is now walking hither in order to salute
thee.” When the Queen heard this, she rose and going to meet
Shamsah, saluted her and seated her awhile by her side. Presently
the Queen and her retinue of noble women, the spouses of the
Emirs and Grandees, returned with Princess Shamsah to the tent
occupied by her daughter-in-law and sat there. Meanwhile, King
Teghmus gave great largesse to his levies and lieges and rejoiced
in his son with exceeding joy, and they tarried there ten days,
feasting and merry-making and living a most joyous life. At the
end of this time, the King commanded a march and they all
returned to the capital, so he took horse surrounded by all the
troops with the Wazirs and Chamberlains to his right and left:
nor ceased they faring till they entered the city, which was decorated
after the goodliest fashion; for the folk had adorned the
houses with precious stuffs and jewellery and spread costly brocades
under the hoofs of the horses. The drums beat for glad
tidings and the Grandees of the kingdom rejoiced and brought
rich gifts and the lookers on were filled with amazement. Furthermore,
they fed the mendicants and Fakirs and held high
festival for the space of ten days, and the lady Shamsah joyed
with exceeding joy whenas she saw this. Then King Teghmus
summoned architects and builders and men of art and bade them
build a palace in that garden. So they straightway proceeded to
do his bidding; and, when Janshah knew of his sire’s command,
he caused the artificers to fetch a block of white marble and carve
it and hollow it in the semblance of a chest; which being done,
he took the feather-vest of Princess Shamsah wherewith she had
flown with him through the air: then, sealing the cover with
melted lead, he ordered them to bury the box in the foundations
and build over it the arches whereon the palace was to rest. They
did as he bade them, nor was it long before the palace was finished:
then they furnished it and it was a magnificent edifice, standing
in the midst of the garden, with streams flowing under its walls.<a id="r551"></a><a href="#f551" class="c011"><sup>[551]</sup></a>
Upon this the King caused Janshah’s wedding to be celebrated
with the greatest splendour and they brought the bride to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_356">356</span>castle in state procession and went their ways. When the lady
Shamsah entered, she smelt the scent of her feather-gear——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Sixteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
lady Shamsah entered the new palace, she smelt the scent of her
flying feather-gear and knew where it was and determined to take
it. So she waited till midnight, when Janshah was drowned in
sleep; then she rose and going straight to the place where the
marble-coffer was buried under the arches she hollowed the ground
alongside till she came upon it; when she removed the lead wherewith
it was soldered and, taking out the feather-suit, put it on.
Then she flew high in air and perching on the pinnacle of the
palace, cried out to those who were therein, saying, “I pray you
fetch me Janshah, that I may bid him farewell.” So they told
him and he came out and, seeing her on the terrace-roof of the
palace, clad in her feather-raiment, asked her, “Why hast thou
done this deed?”; and she answered “O my beloved and coolth
of mine eyes and fruit of my heart, by Allah, I love thee passing
dear and I rejoice with exceeding joy in that I have restored thee
to thy friends and country and thou hast seen thy mother and
father. And now, if thou love me as I love thee, come to me at
Takní, the Castle of Jewels.” So saying, she flew away forthright
to find her family and friends, and Janshah fell down
fainting, being well-nigh dead for despair. They carried the
news to King Teghmus, who mounted at once and riding to the
palace, found his son lying senseless on the ground; whereat he
wept knowing that the swoon was caused by the loss of his love,
and sprinkled rose-water on his face.<a id="r552"></a><a href="#f552" class="c011"><sup>[552]</sup></a> When the Prince came
to himself and saw his sire sitting at his head, he wept at the
thought of losing his wife and the King asked what had befallen
him. So he replied, “Know, O my father, that the lady Shamsah
is of the daughters of the Jann and she hath done such and such”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_357">357</span>(telling him all that had happened); and the King said, “O my
son, be not troubled and thus concerned, for I will assemble all
the merchants and wayfarers in the land and enquire of them
anent that castle. If we can find out where it is, we will journey
thither and demand the Princess Shamsah of her people; and we
hope in Allah the Almighty that He will give her back to thee
and thou shalt consummate thy marriage.” Then he went out
and, calling his four Wazirs without stay or delay, bade them
assemble all the merchants and voyagers in the city and question
them of Takni, the Castle of Jewels, adding, “Whoso knoweth it
and can guide us thither, I will surely give him fifty thousand
gold pieces.” The Wazirs accordingly went forth at once and
did as the King bade them, but neither trader nor traveller
could give them news of Takni, the Castle of Jewels; so they
returned and told the King. Thereupon he bade bring beautiful
slave-girls and concubines and singers and players upon instruments
of music, whose like are not found but with the Kings:
and sent them to Janshah, so haply they might divert him from
the love of the lady Shamsah. Moreover, he despatched couriers
and spies to all the lands and islands and climes, to enquire for
Takni, the Castle of Jewels, and they made quest for it two
months long, but none could give them news thereof. So they
returned and told the King, whereupon he wept bitter tears
and going in to his son found Janshah sitting amidst the concubines
and singers and players on harp and zither and so forth,
not one of whom could console him for the lady Shamsah. Quoth
Teghmus, “O my son, I can find none who knoweth this Castle
of Jewels; but I will bring thee a fairer than she.” When
Janshah heard this, his eyes ran over with tears and he recited
these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Patience hath fled, but passion fareth not; ✿ And all my frame with pine is fever-hot:</div>
      <div class="line">When will the days my lot with Shamsah join? ✿ Lo, all my bones with passion-lowe go rot!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now there was a deadly feud between King Teghmus and a
certain King of Hind, by name Kafíd, who had great plenty of
troops and warriors and champions; and under his hand were
a thousand puissant chieftains, each ruling over a thousand tribes
whereof every one could muster four thousand cavaliers. He
reigned over a thousand cities each guarded by a thousand forts
<span class="pageno" id="Page_358">358</span>and he had four Wazirs and under him ruled Emirs, Princes and
Sovereigns; and indeed he was a King of great might and
prowess whose armies filled the whole earth. Now King Teghmus
had made war upon him and ravaged his reign and slain his men
and of his treasures had made gain. But when it came to King
Kafid’s knowledge that King Teghmus was occupied with the
love of his son, so that he neglected the affairs of the state and
his troops were grown few and weak by reason of his care and
concern for his son’s state, he summoned his Wazirs and Emirs
and said to them, “Ye all know that whilom King Teghmus
invaded our dominions and plundered our possessions and slew
my father and brethren, nor indeed is there one of you, but he
hath harried his lands and carried off his goods and made prize
of his wives and slain some kinsmen of his. Now I have heard
this day that he is absorbed in the love of his son Janshah, and
that his troops are grown few and weak; and this is the time
to take our blood-revenge on him. So make ready for the march
and don ye your harness of battle; and let nothing stay or delay
you, and we will go to him and fall upon him and slay him and
his son, and possess ourselves of his reign.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Seventeenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
Kafid, King of Hind, commanded his troops and armies to mount
and make for the dominions of King Teghmus, saying, “Get ye
ready for the march and don ye your harness of war; and let
nothing stay or delay you; so we will go to him and fall upon
him and slay him and his son and possess ourselves of his reign.”
They all answered with one voice, saying, “We hear and obey,”
and fell at once to equipping themselves and levying troops;
and they ceased not their preparations for three months and,
when all was in readiness, they beat the drums and sounded the
trumps and flew the flags and banners: then King Kafid set out
at the head of his host and they fared on till they reached the
frontiers of the land of Kabul, the dominions of King Teghmus,
where they began to harry the land and do havoc among the folk,
slaughtering the old and taking the young prisoners. When the
news reached King Teghmus, he was wroth with exceeding wrath
<span class="pageno" id="Page_359">359</span>and assembling his Grandees and officers of state, said to them,
“Know that Kafid hath come to our land and hath entered the
realm we command and is resolved to fight us hand to hand; and
he leadeth troops and champions and warriors, whose number
none knoweth save Allah Almighty; what deme deem ye?”
Replied they, “O King of the age, let us go out to him and give
him battle and drive him forth of our country; and thus deem
we.” So he bade them prepare for battle and brought forth to
them hauberks and cuirasses and helmets and swords and all
manner of warlike gear, such as lay low warriors and do to death
the champions of mankind. So the troops and braves and
champions flocked together and they set up the standards and
beat the drums and sounded the trumpets and clashed the
cymbals and piped on the pipes; and King Teghmus marched
out at the head of his army, to meet the hosts of Hind. And
when he drew near the foe, he called a halt, and encamping with
his host in the Zahrán Valley,<a id="r553"></a><a href="#f553" class="c011"><sup>[553]</sup></a> hard by the frontier of Kabul despatched
to King Kafid by messenger the following letter:—“Know
that what thou hast done is of the doings of the villain rabble and
wert thou indeed a King, the son of a King, thou hadst not done
thus, nor hadst thou invaded my kingdom and slain my subjects
and plundered their property and wrought unright upon them.
Knowest thou not that all this is the fashion of a tyrant?
Verily, had I known that thou durst harry my dominions, I had
come to thee before thy coming and had prevented thee this long
while since. Yet, even now, if thou wilt retire and leave mischief
between us and thee, well and good; but if thou return not, meet
me in the listed field and measure thyself with me in cut and
thrust.” Lastly he sealed his letter and committed to an officer
of his army and sent with him spies to spy him out news. The
messenger fared forth with the missive and, drawing near the
enemy’s camp, he descried a multitude of tents of silk and satin, with
pennons of blue sendal, and amongst them a great pavilion of red
satin, surrounded by a host of guards. He ceased not to advance
till he made this tent and found on asking that it was that of
King Kafid whom he saw seated on a chair set with jewels, in the
midst of his Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees. So he brought out
the letter and straightway there came up to him a company of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_360">360</span>guards, who took it from him and carried it to the King; and
Kafid read it and wrote a reply to this purport:—“After the usual
invocations, We let King Teghmus know that we mean to take
our blood-revenge on thee and wash out our stain and waste thy
reign and rend the curtain in twain and slay the old men and
enslave the young men. But to-morrow, come thou forth to
combat in the open plain, and to show thee thrust and fight will
I deign.” Then he sealed the letter and delivered it to the
messenger, who carried it to King Teghmus——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Kafid
delivered the answering letter to the messenger who carried it to
King Teghmus and delivered it, after kissing the ground between
his hands. Then he reported all that he had seen, saying, “O King
of the age, I espied warriors and horsemen and footmen beyond
count nor can I assist thee to the amount.” When Teghmus read
the reply and comprehended its contents, he was with furious rage
enraged and bade his Wazir Ayn Zar take horse and fall upon the
army of Kafid with a thousand cavaliers, in the middle watch of
the night when they would easily ride home and slay all before
them. Ayn Zar replied, “I hear and I obey,” and at once went
forth to do his bidding. Now King Kafid had a Wazir, Ghatrafán<a id="r554"></a><a href="#f554" class="c011"><sup>[554]</sup></a>
by name, whom he bade take five thousand horse and attack the
host of King Teghmus in like manner. So Ghatrafan did his bidding
and set out on his enterprise marching till midnight. Thus
the two parties met halfway and the Wazir Ghatrafan fell upon
the Wazir Ayn Zar. Then man cried out against man and there
befel sore battle between them till break of day, when Kafid’s
men were routed and fled back to their King in confusion. As
Kafid saw this, he was wroth beyond measure and said to the
fugitives, “Woe to you! What hath befallen you, that ye have
lost your captains?” and they replied, “O King of the age, as the
Wazir Ghatrafan rode forth to fall upon King Teghmus, there
appeared to us halfway and when night was half over, the Wazir
Ayn Zar, with cavaliers and champions, and we met on the slopes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_361">361</span>of Wady Zahran; but ere we were ware we found ourselves in the
enemy’s midst, eye meeting eye; and we fought a fierce fight with
them from midnight till morning, many on either side being slain.
Then the Wazir and his men fell to shouting and smiting the
elephants on the face till they took fright at their furious blows,
and turning tail to flee, trampled down the horsemen, whilst none
could see other for the clouds of dust. The blood ran like a rain-torrent
and had we not fled, we had all been cut off to the last
man.” When King Kafid heard this, he exclaimed, “May the
sun not bless you and may he be wroth with you and sore be his
wrath!” Meanwhile Ayn Zar, the Wazir, returned to King
Teghmus and told him what had happened. The King gave him
joy of his safety and rejoiced greatly and bade beat the drums and
sound the trumpets, in honour of the victory; after which he called
the roll of his troops and behold, two hundred of his stoutest
champions had fallen. Then King Kafid marched his army into
the field and drew them out ordered for battle in fifteen lines of
ten thousand horse each, under the command of three hundred
captains, mounted on elephants and chosen from amongst the
doughtiest of his warriors and his champions. So he set up his
standards and banners and beat the drums and blew the trumpets
whilst the braves sallied forth, offering battle. As for King
Teghmus, he drew out his troops line after line and lo! there
were ten of ten thousand horse each, and with him were an
hundred champions, riding on his right hand and on his left.
Then fared forward to the fight each renowned knight, and the
hosts clashed together in their might, whilst the earth for all its
wideness was straitened because of the multitude of the cavaliers
and ears were deafened by drums and cymbals beating and pipes
and hautboys sounding and trumpets blaring and by the thunder
of horse-tramp and the shouting of men. The dust arched in
canopy over their heads and they fought a sore fight from the
first of the day till the fall of darkness, when they separated and
each army drew off to its own camp.——And Shahrazad perceived

<span class="pageno" id="Page_362">362</span>troops and, finding that he had lost five thousand men, raged
with great rage; and King Teghmus mustered his men and seeing
that of them were slain three thousand riders, the bravest of his
braves, was wroth with exceeding wrath. On the morrow King
Kafid again pushed into the plain and did duty as before, while
each man strave his best to snatch victory for himself; and Kafid
cried out to his men, saying, “Is there any of you will sally forth
into the field and open us the chapter of fray and fight?” And
behold came out from the ranks a warrior named Barkayk, a
mighty man of war who, when he reached the King, alighted from
his elephant and kissing the earth before him, sought of him leave
to challenge the foe to combat singular. Then he mounted his
elephant and driving into mid-field, cried out, “Who is for
duello, who is for derring-do, who is for knightly devoir?” When
King Teghmus heard this, he said to his troops, “Which of you
will do single battle with this sworder?” And behold, a cavalier
came out from the ranks, mounted on a charger, mighty of make,
and driving up to the King kissed the earth before him and craved
his permission to engage Barkayk. Then he mounted again and
charged at Barkayk, who said to him, “Who art thou and what art
thou called, that thou makest mock of me by coming out against
me and challenging me, alone?” “My name is Ghazanfar<a id="r555"></a><a href="#f555" class="c011"><sup>[555]</sup></a> son of
Kamkhíl,” replied the Kabul champion; and the other, “I have
heard tell of thee in my own country; so up and do battle between
the ranks of the braves!” Hearing these words Ghazanfar drew
a mace of iron from under his thigh and Barkayk took his good
sword in hand, and they laid on load till Barkayk smote Ghazanfar
on the head with his blade, but the morion turned the blow and
no hurt befel him therefrom; whereupon Ghazanfar, in his turn,
dealt Barkayk so terrible a stroke on the head with his mace, that
he levelled him down to his elephant’s back and slew him. With
this out sallied another and crying to Ghazanfar, “Who be thou
that thou shouldst slay my brother?”; hurled a javelin at him with
such force that it pierced his thigh and nailed his coat of mail to
his flesh. Then Ghazanfar, feeling his hurt, hent his sword in hand
and smote at Barkayk’s brother and cut him in sunder, and he fell
to the earth, wallowing in his life-blood; whilst the challenger of
Kabul galloped back to King Teghmus. Now when Kafid saw
the death of his champions, he cried out to his troops, saying,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_363">363</span>“Down with you to the plain and strike with might and main!”
as also did King Teghmus, and the two armies fought the fiercest
of fights. Horse neighed against horse and man cried out upon
man and brands were bared, whilst the drums beat and the
trumpets blared; and horseman charged upon horseman and
every brave of renown pushed forward, whilst the faint-heart
fled from the lunge of lance and men heard nought but slogan-cry
and the clash and clang of armoury. Slain were the warriors
that were slain<a id="r556"></a><a href="#f556" class="c011"><sup>[556]</sup></a> and they stayed not from the mellay till
the decline of the sun in the heavenly dome, when the Kings
drew off their armies and returned each to its own camp.<a id="r557"></a><a href="#f557" class="c011"><sup>[557]</sup></a>
Then King Teghmus took tally of his men and found that he
had lost five thousand, and four standards had been broken to
bits, whereat he was sore an-angered; whilst King Kafid in like
manner counted his troops and found that he had lost six
hundred, the bravest of his braves, and nine standards were
wanting to the full tale. The two armies ceased joining battle
and rested on their arms three days’ space, after which Kafid
wrote a letter and sent it by messenger to a King called Fákun
al-Kalb (with whom he claimed kinship by the spindle side):
and this kinsman forthwith mustered his men and marched to
meet the King of Hind.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Fakun
mustered his men and marched to meet the King of Hind: and
whileas King Teghmus was sitting at his pleasance, there came
one in to him and said, “I see from afar a cloud of dust spireing
high in air and overspreading the lift.” So he commanded a company
to fare forth and learn the meaning of this; and, crying, “To
hear is to obey,” they sallied out and presently returned and said
to him, “O King, when we drew near the cloud of dust, the wind
rent it and it lifted and showed seven standards and under each
standard three thousand horse, making for King Kafid’s camp.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_364">364</span>Then King Fakun joined himself to the King of Hind and
saluting him, asked, “How is it with thee, and what be this war
in which thou warrest?”; and Kafid answered, “Knowest thou
not that King Teghmus is my enemy and the murtherer of my
father and brothers? Wherefore I am come forth to do battle
with him and take my blood-wreak on him.” Quoth Fakun,
“The blessing of the sun be upon thee!”; and the King of
Hind carried King Fakun al-Kalb to his tent and rejoiced in
him with exceeding joy. Such was the case of the two hostile
Kings; but as regards King Janshah, he abode two months
shut up in his palace, without seeing his father or allowing one
of the damsels in his service to come in to him; at the end of
which time he grew troubled and restless and said to his
attendants, “What aileth my father that he cometh not to visit
me?” They told him that he had gone forth to do battle with
King Kafid, whereupon quoth Janshah, “Bring me my steed, that
I may go to my sire.” They replied, “We hear and obey,” and
brought his horse; but he said in himself, “I am taken up with
the thought of myself and my love and I deem well to mount
and ride for the city of the Jews, where haply Allah shall grant
me the boon to meet the merchant who hired me for the ruby-business
and may be he will deal with me as he dealt before,
for none knoweth whence good cometh.” So he took with him
a thousand horse and set out, the folk saying, “At last Janshah
hath fared forth to join his father in the field, and to fight by
his side;” and they stinted not pushing on till dusk, when they
halted for the night in a vast meadow. As soon as he knew that
all his men were asleep, the Prince rose privily and girding his
waist, mounted his horse and rode away intending to make
Baghdad, because he had heard from the Jews that a caravan
came thence to their city once in every two years and he made
up his mind to journey thither with the next Cafilah. When his
men awoke and missed the Prince and his horse, they mounted
and sought him right and left but, finding no trace of him, rejoined
his father and told him what his son had done; whereat
he was wroth beyond measure and cast the crown from his head,
whilst the sparks were like to fly from his mouth, and he said
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might but in Allah! Verily
I have lost my son, and the enemy is still before me.” But his
Wazirs and vassals said to him, “Patience, O King of the age!
Patience bringeth weal in wake.” Meanwhile Janshah, parted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_365">365</span>from his lover and pained for his father, was in sore sorrow and
dismay, with heart seared and eyes tear-bleared and unable to
sleep night or day. But when his father heard the loss his host
had endured, he declined battle, and fled before King Kafid; and,
retiring to his city, closed the gates and strengthened the walls.
Thereupon King Kafid followed him and sat down before the town,
offering battle seven nights and eight days, after which he withdrew
to his tents, to tend his wounded while the citizens defended
themselves as they best could, fortifying the place and setting up
mangonels and other engines on the walls. Such was the condition
of the two Kings, and war raged between them for a
space of seven years.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twenty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kings
Teghmus and Kafid continued in this condition for seven years;
but, as regards Janshah, he rode through wild and wold and whenever
he came to a town he asked anent Takni, the Castle of
Jewels, but none knew of it and all answered, “Of a truth we
never heard of such place, not even by name.” At last he
happened to enquire concerning the city of the Jews from a
merchant who told him that it was situate in the extreme Orient,
adding, “A caravan will start this very month for the city of
Mizrakán in Hind; whither do thou accompany us and we will
fare on to Khorasan and thence to the city of Shima’ún and
Khwárazm, from which latter place the City of the Jews is distant
a year and three months’ journey.” So Janshah waited till the
departure of the caravan, when he joined himself thereto and
journeyed, till he reached the city of Mizrakan whence, after
vainly asking for Takni, the Castle of Jewels, he set out and
enduring on the way great hardships and perils galore and the
extreme of hunger and thirst, he arrived at the town of Shima’un.
Here he made enquiry for the City of the Jews, and they directed
him to the road thither. So he fared forth and journeyed days and
nights till he came to the place where he had given the apes the
slip, and continued his journey thence to the river, on the opposite
bank of which stood the City of the Jews. He sat down on the
shore and waited till the Sabbath came round and the river dried
<span class="pageno" id="Page_366">366</span>up by decree of Allah Almighty, when he crossed over to the
opposite bank and, entering the city, betook himself to the house
wherein he had lodged on his former journey. The Jew and his
family saluted him and rejoiced in his return and, setting meat
and drink before him, asked, “Where hast thou been during thine
absence?”; and he answered, “In the kingdom of Almighty
Allah!”<a id="r558"></a><a href="#f558" class="c011"><sup>[558]</sup></a> He lay with them that night and on the morrow he
went out to solace himself with a walk about the city and
presently heard a crier crying aloud and saying, “O folk, who will
earn a thousand gold pieces and a fair slave-girl and do half a
day’s work for us?” So Janshah went up to him and said, “I
will do this work.”<a id="r559"></a><a href="#f559" class="c011"><sup>[559]</sup></a> Quoth the crier, “Follow me,” and carrying
him to the house of the Jew merchant, where he had been aforetime,
said, “This young man will do thy need.” The merchant
not recognising him gave him welcome and carried him into the
Harim, where he set meat and drink before him, and he ate and
drank. Then he brought him the money and formally made over
to him the handsome slave-girl with whom he lay that night. As
soon as morning dawned, he took the dinars and the damsel and,
committing them to his Jew host with whom he had lodged aforetime,
returned to the merchant, who mounted and rode out with
him, till they came to the foot of the tall and towering mountain,
where the merchant, bringing out a knife and cords, said to
Janshah, “Throw the mare.” So he threw her and bound her four
legs with the cords and slaughtered her and cut off her head and
four limbs and slit her belly, as ordered by the Jew; whereupon
quoth he, “Enter her belly, till I sew it up on thee; and whatsoever
thou seest therein, tell me of it, for this is the work whose
wage thou hast taken.” So Janshah entered the mare’s belly and
the merchant sewed it up on him; then, withdrawing to a fair
distance, hid himself. And after an hour a great bird swooped
down from the lift and, snatching up the carcass in his pounces
soared high toward the sky. Then he perched upon the mountain-peak
and would have eaten the prey, but Janshah sensing his
intent took out his knife and slit the mare’s belly and came forth.
The bird was scared at his sight and flew away, and Janshah went
up to a place whence he could see below, and looking down,
espied the merchant standing at the foot of the mountain, as he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_367">367</span>were a sparrow. So he cried out to him, “What is thy will, O
merchant?” Replied the Jew, “Throw me down of the stones
that lie about thee, that I may direct thee in the way down.”
Quoth Janshah, “Thou art he who didst with me thus and thus
five years ago, and through thee I suffered hunger and thirst and
sore toil and much trouble; and now thou hast brought me hither
once more and thinkest to destroy me. By Allah, I will not
throw thee aught!” So saying, he turned from him and set out
for where lived Shaykh Nasr, the King of the Birds.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Janshah
took the way for where lived Shaykh Nasr, the King of the Birds.
And he ceased not faring on many days and nights, tearful-eyed
and heavy-hearted; eating, when he was anhungered, of the growth
of the ground and drinking, when he thirsted, of its streams, till he
came in sight of the Castle of the lord Solomon and saw Shaykh
Nasr sitting at the gate. So he hastened up to him and kissed
his hands; and the Shaykh saluted him and bade him welcome
and said to him, “O my son, what aileth thee that thou returnest
to this place, after I sent thee home with the Princess Shamsah,
cool of eyes and broad of breast?” Janshah wept and told him
all that had befallen him and how she had flown away from him,
saying, “An thou love me, come to me in Takni, the Castle of
Jewels;” at which the old man marvelled and said, “By Allah, O
my son, I know it not, nor, by the virtue of our lord Solomon,
have I ever in my life heard its name!” Quoth Janshah, “What
shall I do? I am dying of love and longing.” Quoth Shaykh
Nasr, “Take patience until the coming of the birds, when we will
enquire at them of Takni, the Castle of Jewels; haply one of them
shall wot thereof.” So Janshah’s heart was comforted and, entering
the Palace, he went straight to the chamber which gave upon
the Lake in which he had seen the three maidens. After this
he abode with Shaykh Nasr for a while and, one day as he was
sitting with him, the Shaykh said, “O my son, rejoice for the
time of the birds’ coming draweth nigh.” Janshah gladdened to
hear the news; and after a few days the birds began to come and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_368">368</span>Shaykh Nasr said to him, “O my son, learn these names<a id="r560"></a><a href="#f560" class="c011"><sup>[560]</sup></a> and
address thyself with me to meet the birds.” Presently, the fowls
came flying up and saluted Shaykh Nasr, kind after kind, and he
asked them of Takni, the Castle of Jewels, but they all made answer,
“Never heard we of such a place.” At these words Janshah wept
and lamented till he swooned away; whereupon Shaykh Nasr
called a huge volatile and said to him, “Carry this youth to the land
of Kabul,” and described to him the country and the way thither.
Then he set Janshah on the bird’s back, saying, “Be careful to sit
straight and beware of leaning to either side, else thou wilt be
torn to pieces in the air; and stop thine ears from the wind, lest
thou be dazed by the noise of the revolving sphere and the roaring
of the seas.” Janshah resolved to do his bidding and the bird took
flight high in sky and flew with him a day and a night, till he set
him down by the King of the Beasts, whose name was Sháh Badrí,
and said to his rider, “We have gone astray from the way directed
by Shaykh Nasr.” And he would have taken him up again and
flown on with him; but Janshah said, “Go thy ways and leave me
here; till I die on this spot or I find Takni, the Castle of Jewels,
I will not return to my country.” So the fowl left him with Shah
Badri, King of the Beasts and flew away. The King thereupon
said to him, “O my son, who art thou and whence comest thou
with yonder great bird?” So Janshah told him his story from
beginning to end, whereat Shah Badri marvelled and said, “By
the virtue of the lord Solomon, I know not of this castle; but if
any one of the beasts my subjects know it, we will reward him
bountifully and send thee by him thither.” Hereat Janshah wept
bitterly but presently he took patience and abode with Shah
Badri, and after a short time the King of the Beasts said to him,
“O my son, take these tablets and commit to memory that which
is therein; and when the beasts come, we will question them of
the Castle of Jewels.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p class="c000">She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
King of the Beasts said to Janshah, “Commit to memory what is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_369">369</span>in these tablets; and whenas the beasts come, we will ask them
anent that castle.” He did as the King bade him, and before
long, up came the beasts, kind after kind, and saluted Shah Badri,
who questioned them of Takni, the Castle of Jewels; but they all
replied, “We know not this castle, nor ever heard we of it.” At
this Janshah wept and lamented for that he had not gone with the
bird that brought him from Shaykh Nasr’s castle; but Shah Badri
said to him, “Grieve not, O my son, for I have a brother, King
Shimákh hight, who is older than I; he was once a prisoner to
King Solomon, for that he rebelled against him; nor is there
among the Jinn one elder than he and Shaykh Nasr. Belike he
knoweth of this castle; at any rate he ruleth over all the Jinn in
this country side.” So saying he set Janshah on the back of a
beast and gave him a letter to his brother, commending him to
his care. The beast set off with the Prince forthwith and fared on
days and nights, till it came to King Shimakh’s abiding place.
And when it caught sight of the King it stood still afar off;
whereupon Janshah alighted and walked on, till he found himself
in the presence. Then he kissed hands and presented his brother’s
letter. The King read the missive and, having mastered the
meaning, welcomed the Prince, saying, “By Allah, O my son, in
all my born days I never saw nor heard of this castle!” adding
(as Janshah burst into tears), “but tell me thy story and who and
whence thou art and whither thou art bound.” So Janshah related
to him his history from beginning to end, at which Shimakh marvelled
and said, “O my son, I do not believe that even the lord
Solomon ever saw this castle or heard thereof; but O my son,<a id="r561"></a><a href="#f561" class="c011"><sup>[561]</sup></a> I
know a monk in the mountains, who is exceeding old and whom
all birds and beasts and Jann obey; for he ceased not his conjurations
against the Kings of the Jann, till they submitted themselves
to him in their own despite, by reason of the might of his oaths
and his magic; and now all the birds and the beasts are his servants.
I myself once rebelled against King Solomon and he sent
against me this monk, the only being who could overcome me with
his craft and his conjurations and his gramarye; then he imprisoned
me, and since that time I have been his vassal. He hath travelled
in all countries and quarters and knoweth all ways and regions
and places and castles and cities; nor do I think there is any
<span class="pageno" id="Page_370">370</span>place hidden from his ken. So needs must I send thee to him,
haply he may direct thee to the Castle of Jewels; and, if he cannot
do this, none can; for all things obey him, birds and beasts and
the very mountains and come at his beck and call, by reason of
his skill in magic. Moreover, by the might of his egromancy he
hath made a staff, in three pieces, and this he planteth in the
earth and conjureth over it; whereupon flesh and blood issue from
the first piece, sweet milk from the second and wheat and barley
from the third; then he withdraweth the staff and returneth to
his place which is hight the Hermitage of Diamonds. And this
magical monk is a cunning inventor and artificer of all manner
strange works; and he is a crafty warlock full of guiles and wiles,
an arch-deceiver of wondrous wickedness, who hath mastered
every kind of magic and witchcraft. His name is Yaghmús and
to him I must needs send thee on the back of a big bird with four
wings”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shimakh
said to Janshah, “I must needs send thee to the monk Yaghmus
on the back of a big bird with four wings, each measuring thirty
Háshimi<a id="r562"></a><a href="#f562" class="c011"><sup>[562]</sup></a> cubits in length; and it hath feet like those of an elephant,
but it flieth only twice a year.” And there was with King
Shimakh an officer, by name Timshún, who used every day to
carry off two Bactrian<a id="r563"></a><a href="#f563" class="c011"><sup>[563]</sup></a> camels from the land of Irak and cut them
up for the bird that it might eat them. So King Shimakh bade
the fowl take up Janshah and bear him to the cell of the hermit
Yaghmus; and it rose into the air and flew on days and nights,
till it came to the Mountain of the Citadels and the Hermitage of
Diamonds; where Janshah alighted and going up to the hermitage,
found Yaghmus the Monk at his devotions. So he entered the
chapel and, kissing the ground stood respectfully before the hermit.
When Yaghmus saw him, he said, “Welcome, O my son, O parted
from thy home and garred ferforth to roam! Tell me the cause
<span class="pageno" id="Page_371">371</span>of thy coming hither.” So Janshah wept and acquainted him
with all that had befallen him from beginning to end and that
he was in quest of the Castle of Jewels. The Monk marvelled
greatly at his story and said, “By Allah, O my son, never in my
life heard I of this castle, nor ever saw I one who had heard of it
or had seen it, for all I was alive in the days of Noah, Allah’s
Prophet (on whom be peace!),<a id="r564"></a><a href="#f564" class="c011"><sup>[564]</sup></a> and I have ruled the birds and
beasts and Jinn ever since his time; nor do I believe that Solomon
David-son himself knew of it. But wait till the birds and beasts
and chiefs of the Jann come to do their homage to me and I will
question them of it; peradventure, some one of them may be able
to give us news of it and Allah Almighty shall make all things
easy to thee.” So Janshah homed with the hermit, until the day
of the assembly, when all the birds and beasts and Jann came to
swear fealty; and Yaghmus and his guest questioned them anent
Takni, the Castle of Jewels; but they all replied, “We never saw
or heard of such a place.” At this, Janshah fell a-weeping and
lamenting and humbled himself before the Most High; but, as
he was thus engaged, behold, there flew down from the heights
of air another bird, big of bulk and black of blee, which had
tarried behind the rest, and kissed the hermit’s hands. Yaghmus
asked it of Takni, the Castle of Jewels, and it answered, saying,
“O Monk, when I and my brothers were small chicks we abode
behind the Mountain Kaf on a hill of crystal, in the midst of a
great desert; and our father and mother used to set out for it
every morning and in the evening come back with our food.
They went out early one day, and were absent from us a se’nnight
and hunger was sore upon us; but on the eighth day they returned,
both weeping, and we asked them the reason of their
absence. Quoth they:—A Marid swooped down on us and carried
us off in his claws to Takni, the Castle of Jewels, and brought us
before King Shahlán, who would have slain us; but we told him
that we had left behind us a brood of fledgelings; so he spared
our lives and let us go. And were my parents yet in the bonds
of life they would give thee news of the castle.” When Janshah
heard this, he wept bitter tears and said to the hermit, “Prithee
bid the bird carry me to his father and mother’s nest on the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_372">372</span>crystal hill, behind the Mountain Kaf.” So the hermit said,
“O bird, I desire thee to obey this youth in whatsoever he may
command thee.” “I hear and obey thy bidding,” replied the fowl;
and, taking Janshah on its back, flew with him days and nights
without ceasing till it set him down on the Hill of Crystal and
there alighted. And having delayed there a resting while, it
again set him on its back and flew off and ceased not flying for
two whole days till it reached the spot where the nest was.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the fowl
ceased not flying with Janshah two full days; till it reached the
spot where the nest was, and set him down there and said, “O
Janshah, this is where our nest was.” He wept sore and replied,
“I pray thee bear me farther on to where thy parents used to
forage for food.” The bird consented; so it took him up again
and flew on with him seven nights and eight days, till it set him
down on the top of a high hill Karmús hight and left him there
saying, “I know of no land behind this hill.” Then it flew away
and Janshah sat down on the hill-top and fell asleep. When he
awoke, he saw a something gleaming afar off as it were lightning
and filling the firmament with its flashings; and he wondered
what this sheen could be without wotting that it was the Castle
he sought. So he descended the mountain and made towards
the light, which came from Takni, the Castle of Jewels, distant
two months’ journey from Karmús, the hill whereon he had alit
and its foundations were fashioned of red rubies and its buildings
of yellow gold. Moreover, it had a thousand turrets builded of
precious metals, and stones of price studded and set in the minerals
brought from the Main of Murks, and on this account it was
named the Castle of Jewels, Takni. It was a vast great castle
and the name of its king was King Shahlan, the father of the
lady Shamsah and her sisters. Such was the case with Janshah;
but as regards Princess Shamsah, when she fled from Janshah,
she made straight for the Castle of Jewels and told her father
and mother all that had passed between the Prince and herself;
how he had wandered the world and seen its marvels and wonders
<span class="pageno" id="Page_373">373</span>and how fondly he loved her and how dearly she loved him.
Quoth they, “Thou hast not dealt righteously with him, as Allah
would have thee deal.” Moreover King Shahlan repeated the
story to his guards and officers of the Marids of the Jinn and
bade them bring him every mortal they should see. For the
lady Shamsah had said to her parents, “Janshah loveth me with
passionate love and forsure he will follow me; for when flying
from his father’s roof I cried to him:—An thou love me, seek
me at Takni, the Castle of Jewels!” Now when Janshah beheld
that sheen and shine, he made straight for it wishing to find out
what it might be. And as chance would have it, Shamsah had
that very day despatched a Marid on an occasion in the direction
of the hill Karmus, and on his way thither he caught sight
of a man, a mortal; so he hastened up to him and saluted him.
Janshah was terrified at his sight, but returned his salam, and
the Marid asked, “What is thy name?” and he answered, “My
name is Janshah, and I have fallen madly in love with a Jinniyah
known as Princess Shamsah, who captivated me by her beauty
and loveliness; but despite my dear love she fled from the palace
wherein I placed her and behold, I am here in quest of her.”
Herewith he wept with bitter weeping. The Marid looked at
him and his heart burned with pity on hearing the sad tale, and
he said, “Weep not, for surely thou art come to thy desire. Know
that she loveth thee fondly and hath told her parents of thy love
for her, and all in yonder castle love thee for her sake; so be of
good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear.” Then he took
him on his shoulders and made off with him to the Castle of
Jewels, Takni. Thereupon the bearers of fair tidings hastened
to report his coming and when the news reached Shamsah and
her father and mother, they all rejoiced with exceeding joy, and
King Shahlan took horse and rode out, commanding all his guards
and Ifrits and Marids honourably to meet the Prince.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Shahlan commanded all his guards and Ifrits and Marids to
meet the Prince; and, as soon as he came up with him, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_374">374</span>dismounted and embraced him, and Janshah kissed his hand.
Then Shahlan bade put on him a robe of honour of many-coloured
silk, laced with gold and set with jewels, and a coronet such as
man never saw, and, mounting him on a splendid mare of the
steeds of the Kings of the Jinn, took horse himself and, with an
immense retinue riding on the right hand and the left, brought
him in great state to the Castle. Janshah marvelled at the splendour
of this edifice, with its walls builded of rubies and other
jewels and its pavement of crystal and jasper and emerald, and
fell a-weeping at the memory of his past miseries; but the King
and Queen, Shamsah’s mother, wiped away his tears and said,
“Now no more weeping and be of good cheer, for thou hast won
to thy will.” Then Shahlan carried him into the inner court of
the Castle, where he was received by a multitude of beautiful
damsels and pages and black Jinn-slaves, who seated him in the
place of honour and stood to do him service, whilst he was lost in
amazement at the goodliness of the place, and its walls all edified
of precious metals and jewels of price. Presently King Shahlan
repaired to his hall of audience, where he sat down on his throne
and, bidding the slave-girls and the pages introduce the Prince,
rose to receive him and seated him by his side on the throne.
Then he ordered the tables to be spread and they ate and drank
and washed their hands; after which in came the Queen Shamsah’s
mother, and saluting Janshah, bade him welcome in these words,
“Thou hast come to thy desire after weariness and thine eyes shall
now sleep after watching; so praised be Allah for thy safety!”
Thus saying, she went away and forthwith returned with the Princess
Shamsah, who saluted Janshah and kissed his hands, hanging
her head in shame and confusion before him and her parents; after
which as many of her sisters as were in the palace came up to him
and greeted him in like manner. Then quoth the Queen to him,
“Welcome, O my son, our daughter Shamsah hath indeed sinned
against thee, but do thou pardon her misdeed for our sakes.”
When Janshah heard this, he cried out and fell down fainting,
whereat the King marvelled and they sprinkled on his face rose-water
mingled with musk and civet, till he came to himself and,
looking at Princess Shamsah, said, “Praised be Allah who hath
brought me to my desire and hath quenched the fire of my heart!”
Replied she, “May He preserve thee from the Fire!; but now tell
me, O Janshah, what hath befallen thee since our parting and
how thou madest thy way to this place; seeing that few even of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_375">375</span>the Jann ever heard of Takni, the Castle of Jewels; and we are
independent of all the Kings nor any wotteth the road hither.”
Thereupon he related to her every adventure and peril and hardship
he had suffered and how he had left his father at war with
King Kafid, ending with these words, “And all for thy sake, my
lady Shamsah!” Quoth the Queen, “Now hast thou thy heart’s
desire, for the Princess is thy handmaid, and we give her in free gift
to thee.” Janshah joyed exceedingly at these words and the Queen
added, “Next month, if it be the will of Almighty Allah, we will
have a brave wedding and celebrate the marriage festival and after
the knot is tied we will send you both back to thy native land,
with an escort of a thousand Marids of our body-guard, the least
of whom, an thou bid him slay King Kafid and his folk, would
surely destroy them to the last man in the twinkling of an eye.
Furthermore if it please thee we will send thee, year after year, a
company of which each and every can so do with all thy foes.”——And

lady Shamsah’s mother ended with saying, “And if it so please thee
we will send thee, year after year, a company of which each and
every can destroy thy foes to the last man.” Then King Shahlan
sat down on his throne and, summoning his grandees and officers
of state, bade them make ready for the marriage-festivities and
decorate the city seven days and nights. “We hear and we obey,”
answered they and busied themselves two months in the preparations,
after which they celebrated the marriage of the Prince and
Princess and held a mighty festival, never was there its like. Then
they brought Janshah in to his bride and he abode with her in all
solace of life and delight for two years, at the end of which time
he said to her, “Thy father promised to send us to my native land,
that we might pass one year there and the next here.” Answered
she, “I hear and obey,” and going in to King Shahlan at nightfall
told him what the Prince had said. Quoth he, “I consent; but
have patience with me till the first of the month, that I may make
ready for your departure.” She repeated these words to her husband
and they waited till the appointed time, when the King bade
<span class="pageno" id="Page_376">376</span>his Marids bring out to them a great litter of red gold, set with
pearls and jewels and covered with a canopy of green silk, purfled
in a profusion of colours and embroidered with precious stones,
dazzling with its goodliness the eyes of every beholder. He chose
out four of his Marids to carry the litter in whichever of the four
quarters the riders might choose. Moreover, he gave his daughter
three hundred beautiful damsels to wait upon her and bestowed on
Janshah the like number of white slaves of the sons of the Jinn.
Then the lady Shamsah took formal leave of her mother and
sisters and all her kith and kin; and her father fared forth with
them. So the four Marids took up the litter, each by one corner,
and rising under it like birds in air, flew onward with it between
earth and heaven till midday, when the King bade them set it
down and all alighted. Then they took leave of one another and
King Shahlan commended Shamsah to the Prince’s care, and
giving them in charge to the Marids, returned to the Castle of
Jewels, whilst the Prince and Princess remounted the litter, and
the Marids taking it up, flew on for ten whole days, in each of
which they accomplished thirty months’ journey, till they sighted
the capital of King Teghmus. Now one of them knew the land
of Kabul; so when he saw the city, he bade the others let down
the litter at that populous place which was the capital.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Marid-guards
let down the litter at the capital of King Teghmus who
had been routed and had fled from his foes into the city, where he
was in sore straits, King Kafid having laid close siege to him. He
sought to save himself by making peace with the King of Hind,
but his enemy would give him no quarter; so seeing himself without
resource or means of relief, he determined to strangle himself
and to die and be at rest from this trouble and misery. Accordingly
he bade his Wazirs and Emirs farewell and entered his house
to take leave of his Harim; and the whole realm was full of weeping
and wailing and lamentation and woe. And whilst this rout and
hurly-burly was enacting, behold, the Marids descended with the
litter upon the palace that was in the citadel, and Janshah bade
<span class="pageno" id="Page_377">377</span>them set it down in the midst of the Divan. They did his bidding
and he alighted with his company of handmaids and Mamelukes;
and, seeing all the folk of the city in straits and desolation and
sore distress, said to the Princess, “O love of my heart and coolth
of mine eyes, look in what a piteous plight is my sire!” Thereupon
she bade the Marid-guard fall upon the beleaguering host
and slay them, saying, “Kill ye all, even to the last man;” and
Janshah commanded one of them, by name Karátash,<a id="r565"></a><a href="#f565" class="c011"><sup>[565]</sup></a> who was
exceeding strong and valiant, to bring King Kafid to him in
chains. So they set down the litter and covered it with the
canopy; then, having waited till midnight, they attacked the
enemy’s camp one of them being a match for ten; or at least for
eight. And while these smote the foes with iron maces, those
mounted their magical elephants and soared high in the lift, and
then swooping down and snatching up their opponents, tare them
to pieces in mid-air. But Karatash made straight for Kafid’s
tent where he found him lying in a couch; so he took him up,
shrieking for fear, and flew with him to Janshah, who bade the
four Marids bind him on the litter and hang him high in the air
over his camp, that he might witness the slaughter of his men.
They did as the Prince commanded them and left Kafid, who
had swooned for fear, hanging between earth and air and buffetting
his face for grief. As for King Teghmus, when he saw his
son, he well-nigh died for excess of joy and, crying with a loud
cry, fell down in a swoon. They sprinkled rose-water on his
face, till he came to himself, when he and his son embraced and
wept with sore weeping; for he knew not that the Jinn-guard
were battling with King Kafid’s men. Then Princess Shamsah
accosted the King and kissing his hand, said to him, “Sire, be
pleased to go up with me to the palace-roof and witness the
slaughter of thy foes by my father’s Marids.” So he went up
to the terrace-roof and sitting down there with his daughter-in-law,
enjoyed watching the Marids do havoc among the besiegers
and break a way through the length and breadth of them. For
one of them smote with his iron mace upon the elephants and
their riders and pounded them till man was not to be distinguished
from beast; whilst another shouted in the faces of those
who fled, so that they fell down dead; and the third caught up
<span class="pageno" id="Page_378">378</span>a score of horsemen, beasts and all; and, towering with them
high in air, cast them down on earth, so that they were torn in
pieces. And this was high enjoyment for Janshah and his father
and the lady Shamsah.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Teghmus and his son and daughter-in-law went up to the terrace-roof
and enjoyed a prospect of the Jinn-guards battling with the
beleaguering host. And King Kafid (still hanging between heaven
and earth) also saw the slaughter of his troops and wept sore and
buffetted his face; nor did the carnage cease among the army
of Hind for two whole days, till they were cut off even to the
last man. Then Janshah commanded a Marid, by name Shimwál,
chain up King Kafid with manacles and fetters, and imprison him
in a tower called the Black Bulwark. And when his bidding was
done, King Teghmus bade beat the drums and despatched messengers
to announce the glad news to Janshah’s mother, informing
her of his approach; whereupon she mounted in great joy and
she no sooner espied her son than she clasped him in her arms
and swooned away for stress of gladness. They sprinkled rose-water
on her face, till she came to herself, when she embraced him
again and again wept for excess of joy. And when the lady
Shamsah knew of her coming, she came to her and saluted her;
and they embraced each other and after remaining embraced for
an hour sat down to converse. Then King Teghmus threw open
the city-gates and despatched couriers to all parts of the kingdom,
to spread the tidings of his happy deliverance; whereupon all his
princely Vassals and Emirs and the Grandees of the realm flocked
to salute him and give him joy of his victory and of the safe
return of his son; and they brought him great store of rich
offerings and curious presents. The visits and oblations continued
for some time, after which the King made a second and
a more splendid bride-feast for the Princess Shamsah and bade
decorate the city and held high festival. Lastly they unveiled
and paraded the bride before Janshah, with apparel and ornaments
of the utmost magnificence, and when her bridegroom went
in to her he presented her with an hundred beautiful slave-girls
<span class="pageno" id="Page_379">379</span>to wait upon her. Some days after this, the Princess repaired
to the King and interceded with him for Kafid, saying, “Suffer
him return to his own land, and if henceforward he be minded to
do thee a hurt, I will bid one of the Jinn-guard snatch him up and
bring him to thee.” Replied Teghmus, “I hear and I obey,”
and bade Shimwal bring him the prisoner, who came manacled
and fettered and kissed earth between his hands. Then he commanded
to strike off his chains and, mounting him on a lame
mare, said to him, “Verily Princess Shamsah hath interceded
for thee: so begone to thy kingdom, but if thou fall again to
thine old tricks, she will send one of the Marids to seize thee
and bring thee hither.” Thereupon King Kafid set off homewards,
in the sorriest of plights,——And Shahrazad perceived

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Kafid set off homewards in the sorriest of plights, whilst Janshah
and his wife abode in all solace and delight of life, making the
most of its joyance and happiness. All this recounted the youth
sitting between the tombs unto Bulukiya, ending with, “And
behold, I am Janshah who witnessed all these things, O my
brother, O Bulukiya!” Then Bulukiya who was wandering the
world in his love for Mohammed (whom Allah bless and keep!)
asked Janshah, “O my brother, what be these two sepulchres
and why sittest thou between them and what causeth thy weeping?”
He answered, “Know, O Bulukiya, that we abode in all
solace and delight of life, passing one year at home and the next
at Takni, the Castle of Jewels, whither we betook not ourselves but
in the litter borne by the Marids and flying between heaven and
earth.” Quoth Bulukiya, “O my brother, O Janshah, what was
the distance between the Castle and thy home?” Quoth he,
“Every day we accomplished a journey of thirty months and
the time we took was ten days. We abode on this wise a many
of years till, one year we set out for the Castle of Jewels, as was
our wont, and on the way thither alighted from the litter in this
island to rest and take our pleasure therein. We sat down on the
river-bank and ate and drank; after which the Lady Shamsah,
having a mind to bathe, put off her clothes and plunged into the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_380">380</span>water. Her women did likewise and they swam about awhile,
whilst I walked on along the bank of the stream leaving them
to swim about and play with one another. And behold, a huge
shark of the monsters of the deep seized the Princess by the leg,
without touching any of the girls; and she cried out and died
forthright, whilst the damsels fled out of the river to the pavilion,
to escape from the shark. But after awhile they returned and
taking up her corpse carried her to the litter. Now when I saw
her dead, I fell down fainting and they sprinkled water on my
face, till I recovered and wept over her. Then I despatched the
Jinn-guards to her parents and family, announcing what had
befallen her; and in the shortest time they came to the spot
and washed her and shrouded her; after which they buried her
by the river-side and made mourning for her. They would have
carried me with them to their own country; but I said to King
Shahlan, “I beseech thee to dig me a grave beside her tomb,
that, when I die, I may be buried by her side in that grave.”
Accordingly, the King commanded one of his Marids to do as I
wished, after which they departed and left me here to weep and
mourn for her till I die. And this is my story and the cause of
my sojourn between these two tombs.” And he repeated these
two couplets:<a id="r566"></a><a href="#f566" class="c011"><sup>[566]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Bulukiya heard out Janshah’s tale he wondered and exclaimed,
“By Allah, methought I had indeed wandered over the world and
compassed it about; but now I forget all I have seen after listening
<span class="pageno" id="Page_381">381</span>to these adventures of thine!” He was silent a while and
then resumed, “I beg thee, of thy favour and courtesy, to direct
me in the way of safety.” So Janshah directed him into the right
road, and Bulukiya farewelled him and went his ways. All this
the Serpent-queen related to Hasib Karim al-Din, and he asked
her, “But how knowest thou of these things?”; and she answered,
“O Hasib, thou must ken that I had occasion, some five-and-twenty
years ago, to send one of my largest serpents to Egypt
and gave her a letter for Bulukiya, saluting him.” So she went
there willingly for she had a daughter in the land called Bint
Shumukh<a id="r567"></a><a href="#f567" class="c011"><sup>[567]</sup></a>; and after asking anent Bulukiya she found him and
gave him my missive. He read it and replied to the messenger
snake, “Thou comest from the Queen of the Serpents whom I am
minded to visit for I have an occasion to her.” She replied, “I
hear and obey.” Then she bore him to her daughter of whom
she took leave and said to her companion, “Close thine eyes.”
So he closed them and opening them again, behold, he found himself
on the mountain where I now am. Then his guide carried
him to a great serpent, whom he saluted; whereupon quoth she,
“Didst thou deliver the missive to Bulukiya?”; and she replied,
“Even so; and he hath accompanied me and here he standeth.”
Presently Bulukiya asked after me, the Serpent-queen, and the great
serpent answered, “She hath gone to the mountain Kaf with all
her host, as is her wont in winter; but next summer she will come
hither again. As often as she goeth thither, she appointeth me to
reign in her room, during her absence; and if thou have any occasion
to her, I will accomplish it for thee.” Said he, “I beg thee
to bring me the herb, which whoso crusheth and drinketh the juice
thereof, sickeneth not neither groweth grey nor dieth.” “I will
not bring it,” said the serpent, “till thou tell me what befel thee
since thou leftest the Queen of the Serpents, to go with Affan in
quest of King Solomon’s tomb.” So he related to her all his
travels and adventures, together with the history of Janshah, and
said at last, “Grant me my request, that I may return to mine
own country.” Replied the serpent, “By the virtue of the lord
Solomon, I know not where is to be found the herb whereof thou
speakest.” Then she bade the serpent which had brought him
thither, carry him back to Egypt: so the messenger obeyed her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_382">382</span>and said to him, “Shut thine eyes!” He did so and, opening
them again, found himself on the mountain Mukattam.<a id="r568"></a><a href="#f568" class="c011"><sup>[568]</sup></a> “When
I returned from the mountain Kaf” (added the Queen) “the serpent,
my deputy, informed me of Bulukiya’s visit and gave me his
salutations and repeated to me his story and his meeting with
Janshah. And this, O Hasib, is how I came to know the adventures
of Bulukiya and the history of Janshah.” Thereupon Hasib
said to her, “O Queen, deign recount to me what befel Bulukiya
as regards his return to Egypt.” She replied, “Know, O Hasib,
that when he parted from Janshah he fared on nights and days
till he came to a great sea; so he anointed his feet with the juice
of the magical herb and, walking over the face of the waters, sped
onwards till he came to an island abounding in trees and springs
and fruits, as it were the Garden of Eden. He landed and
walked about, till he saw an immense tree, with leaves as big
as the sails of a ship. So he went up to the tree and found
under it a table spread with all manner meats, whilst on a
branch of the branches sat a great bird, whose body was of
pearls and leek-green emeralds, its feet of silver, its beak of red
carnelian and its plumery of precious metals; and it was engaged
in singing the praises of Allah the Most High and blessing
Mohammed (on whom be benediction and peace!)”——And

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Bulukiya landed and walked about the island he found therein
many marvels, especially a bird whose body was of pearls and
leek-green emeralds and its plumery of precious metals; and it
was engaged in singing the praises of Allah the Most High and
blessing Mohammed (upon whom be benediction and peace!).
Seeing this he said, “Who and what art thou?” Quoth the
bird, “I am one of the birds of Eden and followed Adam when
Allah Almighty cast him out thence. And know, O my brother,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_383">383</span>that Allah also cast out with him four leaves of the trees of the
garden, to cover his nakedness withal, and they fell to the ground
after awhile. One of them was eaten by a worm, and of it came
silk: the gazelles ate the second and thence proceeded musk; the
third was eaten by bees and gave rise to honey, whilst the fourth
fell in the land of Hind and from it sprang all manner of spices.
As for me, I wandered over the face of earth till Allah deigned give
me this island for a dwelling-place, and I took up my abode here.
And every Friday from night till morning the Saints and Princes<a id="r569"></a><a href="#f569" class="c011"><sup>[569]</sup></a>
of the Faith flock to this place and make pious visitation and eat
from this table spread by Allah Almighty; and after they have
eaten, the table is taken up again to Heaven: nor doth the
food ever waste or corrupt.” So Bulukiya ate his fill of the meats
and praised the Great Creator. And presently, behold, there came
up Al-Khizr<a id="r570"></a><a href="#f570" class="c011"><sup>[570]</sup></a> (with whom be peace!), at sight of whom Bulukiya
rose and saluting him, was about to withdraw, when the bird said
to him, “Sit, O Bulukiya, in the presence of Al-Khizr, on whom
be peace!” So he sat down again, and Al-Khizr said to him, “Let
me know who thou art and tell me thy tale.” Thereupon Bulukiya
related to him all his adventures from beginning to end and
asked, “O my lord, how far is it hence to Cairo?” “Five-and-ninety
years’ journey,” replied the Prophet; whereupon Bulukiya
burst into tears; then, falling at Al-Khizr’s feet, kissed them and
said to him, “I beseech thee deliver me from this strangerhood
and thy reward be with Allah, for that I am nigh upon death and
know not what to do.” Quoth Al-Khizr, “Pray to Allah Almighty
that He permit me to carry thee to Cairo, ere thou perish.” So
Bulukiya wept and humbled himself before Allah who granted his
prayer, and by inspiration bade Al-Khizr bear him to his people.
Then said the Prophet, “Lift thy head, for Allah hath heard thy
prayer and hath inspired me to do what thou desirest; so take
fast hold of me with both thy hands and shut thine eyes.” The
Prince did as he was bidden and Al-Khizr stepped a single step
<span class="pageno" id="Page_384">384</span>forwards, then said to him, “Open thine eyes!” So Bulukiya
opened his eyes and found himself at the door of his palace at
Cairo. He turned, to take leave of Al-Khizr, but found no trace
of him——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Bulukiya,
standing at the gate of his palace, turned to take leave of
Al-Khizr, he found no trace of him and entered the palace. When
his mother saw him, she cried with a loud cry and swooned away
for excess of joy, and they sprinkled water upon her face. After
awhile she came to herself and embraced her son and wept with
sore weeping, whilst Bulukiya wept and laughed by turns. Then
all his friends and kindred came and gave him joy of his safe
return, and the news was noised abroad in the land and there
came to him presents from all parts. Moreover, they beat the
drums and blew the flutes and rejoiced mightily. Then Bulukiya
related to them his adventures ending with recounting how Al-Khizr
had set him down at his palace-door, whereat they marvelled
exceedingly and wept, till all were aweary of weeping. Hasib wondered
at the Queen’s tale and shed many tears over it; then he
again besought her to let him return to his family; but she said,
“I fear me, O Hasib, that when thou gettest back to thy country
thou wilt fail of thy promise and prove traitor to thine oath and
enter the Hammam.” But he swore to her another solemn oath
that he would never again enter the baths as long as he lived;
whereupon she called a serpent and bade her carry him up to the
surface of the earth. So the serpent took him and led him from
place to place, till she brought him out on the platform-edge of
an abandoned cistern and there left him. Upon this he walked to
the city and, coming to his house by the last of the day, at the
yellowing of the sun, knocked at the door. His mother opened
it and seeing her son screamed out and threw herself upon him
and wept for excess of joy. His wife heard her mother-in-law
weeping; so she came out to her and seeing her husband, saluted
him and kissed his hands; and each rejoiced in other with exceeding
joy of all three. Then they entered the house and sat
down to converse; and presently Hasib asked his mother of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_385">385</span>woodcutters, who had left him to perish in the cistern. Quoth she,
“They came and told me that a wolf had eaten thee in the Wady.
As for them, they are become merchants and own houses and
shops, and the world is grown wide for them. But every day they
bring me meat and drink, and thus have they done until the
present time.” Quoth Hasib, “To-morrow do thou go to them
and say:—My son Hasib Karim al-Din hath returned from his
travels; so come ye to meet him and salute him.” Accordingly,
when morning dawned, she repaired to the woodcutters’ houses
and delivered to them her son’s message, which when they heard,
they changed colour, and saying, “We hear and obey,” gave her
each a suit of silk, embroidered with gold, adding, “Present this
to thy good son<a id="r571"></a><a href="#f571" class="c011"><sup>[571]</sup></a> and tell him that we will be with him to-morrow.”
She assented and returning to Hasib gave him their presents
and message. Meanwhile, the woodcutters called together a number
of merchants and, acquainting them with all that had passed between
themselves and Hasib, took counsel with them what they
should do. Quoth the merchants, “It behoveth each one of you
to give him half his monies and Mamelukes.” And they all agreed
to do this; so on the next day, each of them took half his wealth
and, going in to Hasib, saluted him and kissed his hands. Then
they laid before him what they had brought, saying, “This is of
thy bounties, and we are in thy hands.” He accepted their peace-offering
and said, “What is past is past: that which befel us was
decreed of Allah, and destiny doeth away with dexterity.” Quoth
they, “Come, let us walk about and take our solace in the city and
visit the Hammam.” Quoth he, “Not so: I have taken an oath
never again to enter the baths, so long as I live.” Rejoined they,
“At least come to our homes that we may entertain thee.” He
agreed to this, and went to their houses and each of them entertained
him for a night and a day; nor did they cease to do
thus for a whole se’nnight, being seven in number. And now
Hasib was master of monies and houses and shops, and the
merchants of the city foregathered with him and he told them
all that had befallen him. He became one of the chiefs of
the guild and abode on this wise awhile, till it happened one
day, as he was walking about the streets, that he passed the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_386">386</span>door of a Hammam, whose keeper was one of his companions.
When the bathman, who was standing without, caught his eye
he ran up to him and saluted him and embraced him, saying,
“Favour me by entering the bath and there wash and be rubbed
that I may show thee hospitality.” Hasib refused, alleging that
he had taken a solemn oath never again to enter the Hammam;
but the bathman was instant with him, saying, “Be my three wives
triply divorced, an thou enter not and be washed!” When Hasib
heard him thus conjure him, he was confounded and replied, “O
my brother, hast thou a mind to ruin my house and make my
children orphans and lay a load of sin upon my neck?” But his
friend threw himself at his feet and kissed them, saying, “My
happiness dependeth upon thy entering, and be the sin on the
neck of me!” Then all the servants of the bath set upon Hasib
and dragging him in pulled off his clothes. But hardly had he
sat down against the wall and begun to pour water on his head
when a score of men accosted him, saying, “Rise, O man, and
come with us to the Sultan, for thou art his debtor.” Then they
despatched one of them as messenger to the Sultan’s Minister,
who straightway took horse and rode, attended by threescore
Mamelukes, to the baths, where he alighted and going in to
Hasib, saluted him and said, “Welcome to thee!” Then he gave
the bathman an hundred dinars and, mounting Hasib on a horse
he had brought with him, returned with him and all his men to
the Sultan’s palace. Here he bade them aid Hasib to dismount
and, after seating him comfortably, set food before him; and when
they had eaten and drunken and washed their hands, the Wazir
clad him in two dresses of honour each worth five thousand dinars
and said to him, “Know that Allah hath been merciful to us in
sending thee; for the Sultan is nigh upon death by leprosy, and
the books tell us that his life is in thy hands.” Then, accompanied
by a host of Grandees, he took him wondering withal and carried
him through the seven doorways of the palace, till they came to
the King’s chamber. Now the name of this King was Karazdán,
King of Persia and of the Seven Countries, and under his sway
were an hundred sovereign princes sitting on chairs of red gold,
and ten thousand valiant captains, under each one’s hand an
hundred deputies and as many headsmen armed with sword and
axe. They found the King lying on his bed with his face swathed
in a napkin, and groaning for excess of pain. When Hasib saw
this ordinance, his wit was dazed for awe of the King; so he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_387">387</span>kissed the ground before him, and prayed a blessing on him.
Then the Grand Wazir, whose name was Shamhúr, rose and
welcoming Hasib, seated him on a high chair at the King’s right
hand;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir
Shamhur rose to Hasib and seated him on a chair at the right
hand of King Karazdan; after which he called for food and the
tables were laid. And when they had eaten and drunken and
washed their hands, Shamhur stood up (while all present also
stood to do him honour) and, approaching Hasib said to him,
“We are all thy servants and will give thee whatsoever thou
askest, even were it one half the kingdom, so thou wilt but cure
the King.” Saying this, he led him by the hand to the royal
couch, and Hasib, uncovering the King’s face, saw that he was at
last fatal stage of the disease; so he wondered at their hoping for
a cure. But the Wazir kissed his hand and repeated his offers and
ended with saying, “All we want of thee is to heal our King:” so
he said to the Wazir, “True that I am the son of Allah’s prophet,
Daniel, but I know nothing of his art: for they put me thirty
days in the school of medicine and I learnt nothing of the craft.
I would well I knew somewhat thereof and might heal the King.”
Hearing this, the Grand Wazir said, “Do not multiply words upon
us; for though we should gather together to us physicians from
the East and from the West, none could cure the King save thou.”
Answered Hasib, “How can I make him whole, seeing I know
neither his case nor its cure?” Quoth the Minister, “His healing
is in thy hands,” and quoth Hasib, “If I knew the remedy of his
sickness, I would heal him.” Thereupon the Wazir rejoined,
“Thou kennest a cure right well; the remedy of his sickness is
the Queen of the Serpents, and thou knowest her abiding-place
and hast been with her.” When Hasib heard this, he knew that
all this came of his entering the Baths, and repented whenas
repentance availed him naught; then said he, “What is the Queen
of the Serpents? I know her not nor ever in all my life heard I
of this name.” Retorted the Wazir, “Deny not the knowledge of
her, for I have proof that thou knowest her and hast passed two
<span class="pageno" id="Page_388">388</span>years with her.” Repeated Hasib, “Verily, I never saw her nor
even heard of her till this moment;” upon which Shamhur opened
a book and, after making sundry calculations, raised his head
and spake as follows. “The Queen of the Serpents shall foregather
with a man who shall abide with her two years; then
shall he return from her and come forth to the surface of the
earth, and when he entereth the Hammam-bath his belly will
become black.” Then said he, “Look at thy belly.” So Hasib
looked at his own belly and behold, it was black: but he persisted
in his denial and said, “My belly was black from the day
my mother bare me.” Said the Wazir, “I had stationed three
Mamelukes at the door of every Hammam, bidding them note
all who entered and let me know when they found one whose
belly was black: so, when thou enteredst, they looked at thy
belly and, finding it black, sent and told me, after we had well-nigh
lost hope of coming upon thee. All we want of thee is to
show us the place whence thou camest out and after go thy ways;
for we have those with us who will take the Queen of the Serpents
and fetch her to us.” Then all the other Wazirs and Emirs and
Grandees flocked about Hasib who sorely repented of his misdeed;
and they conjured him, till they were weary, to show them
the abode of the Queen; but he ceased not saying, “I never saw
nor heard of the matter.” Then the Grand Wazir called the
hangman and bade him strip Hasib and beat him a sore beating;
and so they did till he saw death face to face, for excess of pain,
and the Wazir said, “We have proof that thou knowest the
abiding-place of the Queen of the Serpents: why wilt thou
persist in denial? Show us the place whence thou camest out
and go from us; we have with us one who will take her, and no
harm shall befal thee.” Then he raised him and bade give him
a dress of honour of cloth of red gold, embroidered with jewels,
and spoke him fair till Hasib yielded and said, “I will show you
the place.” At this the Wazir rejoiced with great joy and took
horse with all his many and rode, guided by Hasib, and never
drew rein till they came to the mountain containing the cavern
wherein he had found the cistern full of honey. There all dismounted
and followed him as he entered, sighing and weeping,
and showed them the well whence he had issued; whereupon
the Wazir sat down thereby and, sprinkling perfumes upon a
chafing-dish, began to mutter charms and conjurations; for he
was a crafty magician and diviner and skilled in spiritual arts.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_389">389</span>He repeated three several formulas of conjuration and between
each threw fresh incense upon the fire, crying out and saying,
“Come forth, O Queen of the Serpents!;” when behold, the
water of the well sank down and a great door opened in the
side, from which came a mighty noise of crying like unto
thunder, so terrible that they thought the well had caved in
and all present fell down fainting; nay, some even died for
fright. Presently, there issued from the well a serpent as big
as an elephant, casting out sparks, like red hot coals, from its
eyes and mouth and bearing on its back a charger of red gold,
set with pearls and jewels, in the midst whereof lay a serpent
from whose body issued such splendour that the place was
illumined thereby; and her face was fair and young and she
spoke with most eloquent tongue. The Serpent-queen turned
right and left, till her eyes fell upon Hasib, to whom said she,
“Where is the covenant thou madest with me, and the oath
thou swarest to me, that thou wouldst never again enter the
Hammam-bath? But there is no fighting against Fate nor hath
any ever fled from that which is written on his forehead. Allah
hath appointed the end of my life for thy hand to hend, and it
is His will that slain I be and King Karazdan be healed of his
malady.” So saying, she wept with sore weeping and Hasib
wept to see her weep. As for the abominable Wazir Shamhur;
he put out his hand to lay hold of her; but she said to him,
“Hold thy hand, O accursed, or I will blow upon thee and
reduce thee to a heap of black ashes.” Then she cried out to
Hasib, saying, “Draw near me and take me in thine hand and
lay me in the dish that is with you: then set it on thy head;
for my death was fore-ordained, from Eternity without beginning,<a id="r572"></a><a href="#f572" class="c011"><sup>[572]</sup></a>
to be at thy hand, and thou hast no power to avert it.”
So he took her and laid her in the dish, and put it on his head,
when the well returned to its former state. Then they set out
on their return to the city, Hasib carrying the dish on his head,
and when they were halfway behold, the Queen of the Serpents
said to him privily, “Hearken, O Hasib, to my friendly counsel,
for all thou hast broken faith with me and been false to thine
oath, and hast done this misdeed, but it was fore-ordained from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_390">390</span>all eternity.” He replied “To hear is to obey,” and she continued,
“It is this: when thou comest to the Wazir’s house, he
will bid thee behead me and cut me in three; but do thou refuse,
saying:—I know not how to slaughter<a id="r573"></a><a href="#f573" class="c011"><sup>[573]</sup></a> and leave him to do it
with his own hand and to work his wicked will. When he hath
cut my throat and divided my body into three pieces there will
come a messenger, to bid him to the King, so he will lay my flesh
in a cauldron of brass and set it upon a brasier before going to the
presence and he will say to thee:—Keep up the fire under the
cauldron till the scum rise; then skim it off and pour it into a
phial to cool. Wait till it cool and then drink it, so shall naught
of malady or pain be left in all thy body. When the second
scum riseth, skim it off and pour it into a phial against my return
from the King, that I may drink it for an ailment I have in my
loins. Then will he give thee the phials and go to the King,
and when he is gone, do thou light the fire and wait till the first
scum rise and set it in a phial; keep it by thee but beware of
drinking it, or no good will befal thee. When the second scum
riseth, skim it off and put it in a second phial and drink it down
as soon as it cools. When the Wazir returneth and asketh thee
for the second phial, give him the first and note what shall befal
him;”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Five Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Serpent-queen
charged Hasib not to drink of the first scum and carefully
to keep the second, saying, “When the Wazir returneth from
the King and asketh for the second phial, give him the first and
note what shall befal him; then drink the contents of the second
phial and thy heart will become the home of wisdom. After this
take up the flesh and, laying it in a brazen platter, carry it to the
King and give him to eat thereof. When he hath eaten it and it
hath settled in his stomach, veil his face with a kerchief and wait
by him till noontide, when he will have digested the meat. Then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_391">391</span>give him somewhat of wine to drink and, by the decree of Allah
Almighty, he will be healed of his unhealth and be made whole
as he was. And give thou ear to the charge wherewith I charge
thee; and keep it in thy memory with carefullest keeping.”
They ceased not faring till they came to the Wazir’s house, and he
said to Hasib, “Come in with me!” So he went in and the
troops dispersed and fared each his own way; whereupon Hasib
set down the platter and the Wazir bade him slay the Queen
of the Serpents; but he said, “I know not how to slaughter and
never in my born days killed I aught. An thou wilt have her
throat cut, do it with thine own hand.” So the Minister Shamhur
took the Queen from the platter and slew her, seeing which Hasib
wept bitter tears and the Wazir<a id="r574"></a><a href="#f574" class="c011"><sup>[574]</sup></a> laughed at him, saying, “O weak
of wits, how canst thou weep for the killing of a worm?” Then
he cut her in three and, laying the pieces in a brass cauldron, set it
on the fire and sat down to await the cooking of the flesh. And
whilst he was sitting, lo! there came a slave from the King, who
said to him, “The King calls for thee without stay or delay;” and
he answered saying, “I hear and I obey.” So he gave Hasib two
phials and bade him drink the first scum and keep the second
against his return, even as the Queen of the Serpents had foretold;
after which he went away with repeated charges and injunctions;
and Hasib tended the fire under the cauldron till the first
scum rose, when he skimmed it off and, setting it in one of the
phials, kept it by him. He then fed the fire till the second scum
rose; then he skimmed it off and, putting it in the other phial,
kept it for himself. And when the meat was done, he took the
cauldron off the fire and sat awaiting the Wazir who asked him on
return, “What hast thou done?;” and answered Hasib, “I did thy
bidding to the last word.” Quoth the Wazir, “What hast thou
done with the first phial?” “I drank its contents but now,”
replied Hasib, and Shamhur asked, “Thy body feeleth it no
change?”; whereto Hasib answered, “Verily, I feel as I were on
fire from front to foot.” The villain Wazir made no reply hiding
the truth but said, “Hand me the second phial, that I may drink
what is therein, so haply I may be made whole of this ailing in
my loins.” So Hasib brought him the first phial and he drank it
off, thinking it contained the second scum; but hardly had he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_392">392</span>done drinking when the phial fell from his hand and he swelled up
and dropped down dead; and thus was exemplified in him the
saying; “Whoso for his brother diggeth a pit, he shall be the first
to fall into it.” Now when Hasib saw this, he wondered and
feared to drink of the second phial; but he remembered the
Serpent-queen’s injunction and bethought him that the Wazir
would not have reserved the second scum for himself, had there
been aught of hurt therein. So he said, “I put my trust in
Allah,”<a id="r575"></a><a href="#f575" class="c011"><sup>[575]</sup></a> and drank off the contents of the phial. No sooner had
he done so, than the Most Highest made the waters of wisdom to
well up in his heart and opened to him the fountains of knowledge,
and joy and gladness overcame him. Then he took the
serpent’s flesh from the cauldron and, laying it on a platter of
brass, went forth from the Wazir’s house. On his way to the
palace he raised his eyes and saw the seven Heavens and all that
therein is, even to the Lote-tree, beyond which there is no passing,<a id="r576"></a><a href="#f576" class="c011"><sup>[576]</sup></a>
and the manner of the revolution of the spheres. Moreover,
Allah discovered to him the ordinance of the planets and the
scheme of their movements and the fixed stars; and he saw the
contour of the land and sea, whereby he became informed with
geometry, astrology and astronomy and mathematics and all that
hangeth thereby; and he understood the causes and consequences
of eclipses of the sun and moon. Then he looked at the earth
and saw all minerals and vegetables that are therein and thereon;
and he learned their properties, and their virtues, so that he
became in an instant versed in medicine and chemistry and
natural magic and the art of making gold and silver. And he
ceased not carrying the flesh till he came to the palace, when
he went in to King Karazdan, and kissing the ground before
him, said, “May thy head survive thy Wazir Shamhur!” The
King was mightily angered at the news of the Grand Wazir’s
death and wept for him, whilst his Emirs and his Grandees and
officers also wept. Then said Karazdan, “He was with me but
now, in all health, and went away to fetch me the flesh of the
Queen of the Serpents, if it should be cooked; what befel him
<span class="pageno" id="Page_393">393</span>that he is now dead, and what accident hath betided him?” So
Hasib told him the whole truth how the Minister had drunk the
contents of the phial and had forthwith swelled out and died.
The King mourned for his loss with mourning sore and said to
Hasib, “What shall I do without Shamhur?” and Hasib answered
“Grieve not, O King of the age; for I will cure thee within three
days and leave no whit of disease in thy body.” At this the
King’s breast waxed broad and he said, “I wish to be made
whole of this affliction, though after a long term of years.” So
Hasib set the platter before the King and made him eat a slice
of the flesh of the Serpent-queen. Then he covered him up and,
spreading a kerchief over his face, bade him sleep and sat down
by his side. He slept from noonday till sundown, while his
stomach digested the piece of flesh, and presently he awoke.
Hasib gave him somewhat of wine to drink and bade him sleep
again; so he slept till the morning and when dawn appeared,
Hasib repeated the treatment making him eat another piece of
the flesh; and thus he did with him three days following, till
he had eaten the whole, when his skin began to shrink and
scale off and he perspired, so that the sweat ran down from his
head to his heels. Therewith he became whole and there abode
in him no trace of the disease, which when Hasib saw, he said,
“There is no help for it but thou go to the Hammam.” So
he carried him to the bath and washed his body; and when
he came forth, it was like a wand of silver and he was restored
to health, nay, sounder than he was before he fell ill. Thereupon
he donned his richest robes and, seating himself on his throne,
deigned make Hasib sit beside him. Then he bade the tables
be spread and they ate and washed their hands; after which he
called for the service of wine and both drank their fill. Upon
this all his Wazirs and Emirs and Captains and the Grandees
of his realm and the notables of the lieges came in to him and
gave him joy of his recovery; and they beat the drums and
adorned the city in token of rejoicing. Then said the King
to the assembly, “O Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees, this is
Hasib Karim al-Din, who hath healed me of my sickness, and
know all here present that I make him my Chief Wazir in the
stead of the Wazir Shamhur.”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

King Karazdan to his Ministers and high lords, “He who healed
me of my sickness is none other than Hasib Karim al-Din here
present. Therefore I make him my Chief Wazir in the stead of
the Wazir Shamhur; and whoso loveth him loveth me, and whoso
honoureth him honoureth me, and he who obeyeth him obeyeth
me.” “Hearkening and obedience,” answered they and all rising
flocked to kiss Hasib’s hand and salute him and give him joy
of the Wazirate. Then the King bestowed on him a splendid
dress of gold brocade, set with pearls and gems, the least of
which was worth five thousand gold pieces. Moreover, he presented
to him three hundred male white slaves and the like
number of concubines, in loveliness like moons, and three hundred
Abyssinian<a id="r577"></a><a href="#f577" class="c011"><sup>[577]</sup></a> slave-girls, beside five hundred mules laden with
treasure and sheep and oxen and buffaloes and bulls and other
cattle beyond count; and he commanded all his Wazirs and
Emirs and Grandees and Notables and Mamelukes and his subjects
in general to bring him gifts. Presently Hasib took horse and rode,
followed by the Wazirs and Emirs and lords and all the troops,
to the house which the King had set apart for him, where he sat
down on a chair; and the Wazirs and Emirs came up to him and
kissed hands and gave him joy of his Ministership, vying with one
another in suit and service. When his mother and his household
knew what had happened, they rejoiced with exceeding joy and
congratulated him on his good fortune; and his quondam comrades
the woodcutters also came and gave him joy. Then he
mounted again and, riding to the house of the late Wazir
Shamhur, laid hands on all that was therein and transported it
to his own abode. On this wise did Hasib, from a dunsical
know-nothing, unskilled to read writing, become, by the decree
of Allah Almighty, an adept in every science and versed in all
manner of knowledge, so that the fame of his learning was blazed
abroad over the land and he became renowned as an ocean of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_395">395</span>lore and skill in medicine and astronomy and geometry and
astrology and alchemy and natural magic and the Cabbala and
Spiritualism and all other arts and sciences. One day, he said
to his mother, “My father Daniel was exceeding wise and
learned; tell me what he left by way of books or what not!”
So his mother brought him the chest and, taking out the five
leaves which had been saved when the library was lost, gave
them to him saying, “These five scrolls are all thy father left
thee.” So he read them and said to her, “O my mother, these
leaves are part of a book: where is the rest?” Quoth she, “Thy
father made a voyage taking with him all his library and, when
he was shipwrecked, every book was lost save only these five
leaves. And when he was returned to me by Almighty Allah
he found me with child and said to me:—Haply thou wilt bear
a boy; so take these scrolls and keep them by thee and whenas
thy son shall grow up and ask what his father left him, give
these leaves to him and say, Thy father left these as thine only
heritance. And lo! here they are.” And Hasib, now the most
learned of his age, abode in all pleasure and solace and delight
of life, till there came to him the Destroyer of delights and the
Severer of societies.<a id="r578"></a><a href="#f578" class="c011"><sup>[578]</sup></a> And yet, O King, is not this tale of

at hand. The catastrophe is a fact for each man under the form of death; but the world
has endured for untold ages and there is no apparent cause why it should not endure as

be richer in sinners than in sanctity: hence “End of Time” is a facetious Arab title for
a villain of superior quality. My Somali escort applied it to one thus distinguished: in
1875, I heard at Aden that he ended life by the spear as we had all predicted.</p>

We (Allah) had not created the spheres,” which may have been suggested by “Before
Abraham was, I am” (John viii. 58); and by Gate xci. of Zoroastrianism “O Zardusht,
for thy sake I have created the world” (Dabistan i. 344). The sentiment is by no
means “Shi’ah,” as my learned friend Prof. Aloys Springer supposes. In his
Mohammed (p. 220) we find an extract from a sectarian poet, “For thee we dispread
the earth; for thee we caused the waters to flow; for thee we vaulted the heavens.” As
Baron Alfred von Kremer, another learned and experienced Orientalist, reminds me the
“Shi’ahs” have always shown a decided tendency to this kind of apotheosis and have
deified or quasi-deified Ali and the Imams. But the formula is first found in the highly
orthodox Burdah-poem of Al-Busiri:—</p>

inferior stones. The ruby is supposed by Moslems to be a common mineral thoroughly
“cooked” by the sun, and produced only on the summits of mountains inaccessible
even to Alpinists. The idea may have originated from exaggerated legends of the
Badakhshán country (supposed to be the home of the ruby) and its terrors of break-neck
foot-paths, jagged peaks and horrid ravines: hence our “<em>balass</em>-ruby” through the
Spanish corruption “Balaxe.” Epiphanius, archbishop of Salamis in Cyprus, who died
A.D. 403, gives, in a little treatise (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">De duodecim gemmis rationalis summi sacerdotis
Hebræorum Liber, opera Fogginii</span>, Romæ, 1743, p. 30), a precisely similar description
of the mode of finding jacinths in Scythia. “In a wilderness in the interior of Great
Scythia,” he writes, “there is a valley begirt with stony mountains as with walls. It is
inaccessible to man, and so excessively deep that the bottom of the valley is invisible
from the top of the surrounding mountains. So great is the darkness
that it has the effect of a kind of chaos. To this place certain criminals are
condemned, whose task it is to throw down into the valley slaughtered lambs, from
which the skin has been first taken off. The little stones adhere to these pieces of
flesh. Thereupon the eagles, which live on the summits of the mountains, fly down
following the scent of the flesh, and carry away the lambs with the stones adhering to
them. They, then, who are condemned to this place, watch until the eagles have
finished their meal, and run and take away the stones.” Epiphanius, who wrote this, is
spoken of in terms of great respect by many ecclesiastical writers, and St. Jerome styles
the treatise here quoted, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Egregium volumen, quod si legere volueris, plenissimam
scientiam consequeris</span>;” and, indeed, it is by no means improbable that it was from the
account of Epiphanius that this story was first translated into Arabic. A similar account
is given by Marco Polo and by Nicolò de Conti, as of a usage which they had heard was
practised in India, and the position ascribed to the mountain by Conti, namely, fifteen
days’ journey north of Vijanagar, renders it highly probable that Golconda was alluded
to. He calls the mountain Albenigaras, and says that it was infested with serpents.
Marco Polo also speaks of these serpents, and while his account agrees with that of
Sindbad, inasmuch as the serpents, which are the prey of Sindbad’s Rukh, are devoured
by the Venetian’s eagles, that of Conti makes the vultures and eagles fly away with the
meat to places where they may be safe from the serpents. (Introd. p. xlii., India in the
