<p>A certain King once went forth in disguise, to look into the
affairs of his lieges. Presently, he came to a great village which
he entered unattended and being athirst, stopped at the door of a
house and asked for water. There came out to him a fair woman
with a gugglet, which she gave him, and he drank. When he
looked at her, he was ravished with her and besought her favours.
Now she knew him; so she led him into the house and, making
him sit down, brought out a book and said to him, “Look therein
whilst I order my affair and return to thee.” So he looked into
the book, and behold, it treated of the Divine prohibition against
advoutry and of the punishments which Allah hath prepared for
those who commit adulterous sin. When he read this, his flesh
quaked and his hair bristled and he repented to Almighty Allah:
then he called the woman and, giving her the book, went away. Now
her husband was absent and when he returned, she told him what
had passed, whereat he was confounded and said in himself, “I fear
lest the King’s desire have fallen upon her.” And he dared not have
to do with her and know her carnally after this. When some time
had past, the wife told her kinsfolk of her husband’s conduct, and
they complained of him to the King, saying, “Allah advance the
King! This man hired of us a piece of land for tillage, and tilled
it awhile; then left it fallow and neither tilled it nor forsook it,
that we might let it to one who would till it. Indeed, harm is
come to the field, and we fear its corruption, for such land as that,
if it be not sown, spoileth.” Quoth the King to the man, “What
hindereth thee from sowing thy land?” Answered he, “Allah
advance the King! It reached me that the lion entered the field,
wherefor I stood in awe of him and dared not draw near it, since
knowing that I cannot cope with the lion, I stand in fear of him.”
The King understood the parable and rejoined, saying, “O man,
the lion trod and trampled not thy land, and it is good for seed;
so do thou till it and Allah prosper thee in it, for the lion hath
done it no hurt.” Then he bade give the man and his wife a
handsome present and sent them away.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2248" id="noteref-2248" epub:type="noteref">2248</a> And amongst the stories
