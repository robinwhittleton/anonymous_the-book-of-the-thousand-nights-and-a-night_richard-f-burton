<p>It is related that there was a King among the manifold Kings
of Al-Hind, and he had a Wazir which was a right good
counsellor to the realm and pitiful to the lieges and the Fakirs
and merciful to the miserable and just in all his dealings.
Despite this the Grandees of the kingdom hated him and envied
him, and at all times and seasons when he went forth the presence
or returned to his house, one of the Emirs would come forward
and say to the King, “O our lord, verily the Wazir doth of doings
thus and thus,”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to
you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating,
that the Lords of the land, whenever the Wazir was absent
traduced him and maligned him in the presence of the Sultan,
saying, “The Minister doth such and such doings,” and this
continued for a while of time. Now one day of the days, as the
Sultan was sitting in his palace behold, a running messenger
came to him bearing letters from sundry of the provinces which
were in his reign imploring help against their foemen’s violence.
“What may be done in this case?” asked the Sultan, and his
Nobles answered saying, “Send to them the Wazir,” but they
spake not this speech save in their resolve to ruin him and
their determination to destroy him. Hereupon the King sent
for him and summoned him and commanded him to journey
to the places in question; but those of whom the complaints
had been made threw dangers and difficulties in his way. Said
the Wazir, “Hearing and obeying;” and after preparing himself
for wayfare he set forth on his way. Now the Lords had
despatched letters to the province whither he intended, apprising
the folk of his coming, and saying to them, “Empower him not
with anything, and if you avail to work him aught of wrong,
so do.” When the Wazir marched upon those places he was
met by the people with welcomes and deputations to receive him
and offer him presents and rarities and sumptuous gifts, and all
who were therein honoured him with highmost honour. Presently
he sent for their adversaries, and having brought them before him
made peace between the two parties, and their gladness increased
and their sadness ceased, and he tarried with them for a month
full-told; after which he set out on his homeward march. The
Lords, however, had reported all this to the King and they were
right sore and sorrowful, for that their desire had been the
destruction of the Minister. And one day of the days as the
Wazir was sitting at home, behold, a party of Chamberlains
appeared before him and summoned him to the presence, saying,
“Arise, the King requireth thee.” He rose without stay or
delay, and taking horse made for the presence, and ceased not
riding until he had reached the palace and had gone into the King,
who forthright bade throw him into gaol. (Now it happened
that the prison had seven doors.)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7432" id="noteref-7432" epub:type="noteref">7432</a> Cried the Wazir, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great; and verily we be Allah’s and unto Him are we returning!
Would I wot why and wherefore the King hath confined me and
for what cause; but Omnipotence is Allah’s.” As soon as the
Minister was quartered in his new quarters the Sovran sent
to interdict his eating any food of flesh-kind, allowing only
bread and cheese and olives and oil, and so left him in durance
vile. Hereupon all the folk applied them to addressing the King
with petitions and to interceding for the captive; but this was not
possible; nay, the Sultan’s wrath waxed hotter nor did it soon cool,
for the Wazir abode in gaol during the longsome length of seven
years. As last one day of the days that Sultan went forth disguised
in Darwaysh-garb and toured about town unattended, and
ceased not walking until he reached and passed before the palace
of the Wazir, where he found a gathering of much folk, some
sweeping and others sprinkling water, and others spreading,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7433" id="noteref-7433" epub:type="noteref">7433</a>
whilst the Harem and household were in high glee and gladness.
He stood there amongst the spectators and presently asked what
was doing, and they informed him, saying, “The Wazir returneth
from abroad this night and folk have been informed by messenger
that the Sultan hath deigned restore him to favour and expressed
himself satisfied, so presently we shall see him once more at home.”
“Praise be to Allah!” quoth the King in his mind; “by the
Almighty, this occurrence hath no cause, and how went the bruit
abroad that the King hath again accepted him? And now there
is no help but that I forgather with the Wazir and see what there
may be to do and how this occurred.” The Sultan increased in
disquietude therefor, so he went and bought a somewhat of bread
and repairing to the gaol (he being still in Fakir’s garb) accosted
the gaoler and said to him, “Allah upon thee, O my lord, open to
me the bridewell that I may enter and distribute this provaunt
among the prisoners, for that I have obliged myself to such course
by oath, and the cause is that when suffering from a sickness which
brought me nigh to death’s door I vowed a vow and sware a
strong swear that, an Almighty Allah deign heal me, I would buy
somewhat of bread and dole it out to the inmates of the gaol.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7434" id="noteref-7434" epub:type="noteref">7434</a>
So here am I come for such purpose.” Upon this the man opened
to him the door and he went in and all divided the bread
amongst the captives yet he saw not the Wazir; so he said to the
gaoler, “Hath any one remained that I may dole to him his
share?” “O Darwaysh,” said the other, “whereof askest thou?”
and said the Fakir, “O my lord, I have sworn an oath and Allah
upon thee, if there be among the captives any save these I have
seen, do thou tell me thereof.” Quoth the man, “There remaineth
none save the Wazir who is in another place, but indeed he is not
in want;” and quoth the Fakir, “O my lord, my desire is to free
myself from the obligation of mine oath.” Accordingly the gaoler
led him in to the Wazir and when the Darwaysh drew nigh the
visitor shrieked and fell fainting to the floor, and the warder seeing
him prostrate left him to himself and went his ways. Hereupon
the Minister came to him and sprinkling somewhat of water upon
his face said to him, “O Darwaysh, there is no harm to thee!”
So the Fakir arose and said, “O my lord, my heart hath been
upon thee for a while of time;”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy
story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Thirty-first Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
Fakir to the Wazir, “By Allah, O my lord, my heart hath indeed
been with thee for this space of seven years; and often as I went
to thy mansion, they told me that the Sultan is wroth with the
Wazir; withal I still awaited for thee until this very day, when I
repaired to thy quarters according to my custom and I found in
thy house much folk, this sweeping and that sprinkling and that
spreading, and all were in joyous case. So I asked of the bystanders
and they informed me that the Sovran hath become satisfied
with thee and that on the ensuing night thou wilt hie thee home
for that this thy saying is soothfast.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7435" id="noteref-7435" epub:type="noteref">7435</a> “O Darwaysh,” replied the
other, “’Tis true that I sent to my household and informed them
thereof, for that I have received welcome news from an event befel
me; so I bade apprise those at home that the Sultan is satisfied
with me; and to me, O Darwaysh, hath betided a matter wondrous
and an occurrence marvellous; were it written with needle-gravers
upon the eye-corners it had been a warning to whoso would be
warned.” The Fakir asked, “And what may be that?” and the
other answered:—By Allah, O Darwaysh, the while I was in the
service of His Highness the King, I was a true counsellor to him
and pitiful to the lieges and I never deceived him nor did I betray
him at any time at all; and often as he sent me to a place wherein
were mutual strife and trouble and wrong and tyranny, I smoothed
matters and pacified the folk and righted wrongs amongst them by
the power of Almighty Allah. But one day of the days, my mind
was set upon riding out to the waste lands about the town and the
gardens thereof, by way of solacing myself; so I embarked in a
little caïque<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7436" id="noteref-7436" epub:type="noteref">7436</a> upon the river and when we were amid stream I had
a longing for coffee;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7437" id="noteref-7437" epub:type="noteref">7437</a> so I said to the boatman, “Abide in this
place and throw out the anchor while we drink coffee.” Hereat
all my suite arose and busied themselves in preparing it until ’twas
ready and I had a finján<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7438" id="noteref-7438" epub:type="noteref">7438</a> worth a treasury<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7439" id="noteref-7439" epub:type="noteref">7439</a> of money which they
filled and passed to me. I took it as I was sitting upon the gunwale
of the boat whence it dropped into the stream; and I was sorely
sorrowful therefor, because that cup was a souvenir. Seeing this,
all in the boat arose and sent for a diver who asked, saying, “In
what place hath the finjan fallen that I may seek it? and do ye
inform me of its whereabouts.” So we sought for a pebble in the
caïque but we found none, and as I wore upon my finger a signet-ring
which was worth two treasuries of money I drew it off and
cast it into the water crying, “The cup fell from me in this place.”
But when the ducker saw me throw my ring he said to me,
“Wherefore, O my lord, hast thou parted with thy seal?” and
said I to him, “The deed is done.” Then he went down and
plunged into the deep for a while and behold he came up grasping
the cup, in the middle of which we saw the signet-ring. Now
when this mighty great matter befel me, I said to myself, “Ho
certain person, there remaineth upon this good luck no better
luck; and haply there will befal thee somewhat contrary to this.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7440" id="noteref-7440" epub:type="noteref">7440</a>
However those with me rejoiced at the finding of my two losses,
nor did any fear therefrom my change of state and downfall, but
they wondered and said, “By Allah, this is a rare matter!” Then
we went forward in the caïque until we had reached the place
intended, where we tarried the whole of that day and presently
returned home. But hardly was I settled and had I taken seat in
my home-quarters when behold, a party of Chamberlains of the
King’s suite came in to me and said, “The Sultan requireth thee!”
Accordingly, I arose and mounted horse and rode on till I had
come to the palace and entered the presence; and I designed to
offer suit and service to the King as was my wont, when suddenly
he cried, “Carry him away.” So they bore me off and confined
me in this place, after which the Sultan sent and interdicted me from
eating a tittle of flesh food, and here I am after the space of seven
years, O Darwaysh, still in the same condition. Now on the morning
of this day my stomach craved for meat, so I said to the gaoler, “O
Such-and-such, ’tis now seven years since I tasted flesh, so take
this ashrafi and bring us an ounce of meat.” He accepted the
money saying, “’Tis well,” and went forth from me and brought
me my need.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting,
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that
the Wazir continued to the Fakir, “Then, O Darwaysh, we
divided the meat (I and the gaoler) with our fingers, and we
washed it and set it upon the hearth, building a fire beneath
it until it was cooked, when we took it off, and after waiting
awhile dished it up and were about to eat it.” But it happened
to be noon-tide, and the hour of incumbent orisons, so we
said, “Let us pray our prayers;” and we arose and made the
Wuzú ablution, and went through the mid-day devotions. After
this we set the plate before us; and I, removing its cover, put forth
my hand to take up a bit of meat, but as I took it, behold, a mouse
passed over that same morsel with its tail and paws.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7441" id="noteref-7441" epub:type="noteref">7441</a> I cried,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious, the Great! I have divided this meat with my own hand
and have cooked it myself, so how could this matter have occurred?
However, Allah the Omniscient haply knoweth that the stumbling
stone hath been removed from my path,” and this I said, for when
I saw that mouse do on such wise I felt that glad news and good
tidings were coming from the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth.
So I sent to my home and informed them that the Sultan was
satisfied with me, for things when at their worst mend, and in
joyance end; and I opine, O Darwaysh, that all my troubles have
now ceased. Said to him the Fakir, “Alhamdolillah—Glory be to
God—O my lord, who hath sent thee forerunners of welfare.”
Then he arose from beside the Wazir, and went forth and ceased
not wending until he came to his palace where he doffed his disguise
and donned the garments of the Kings, and taking seat upon
the throne of his Kingship summoned the Wazir from his gaol in
all joy, and set him between his hands and gifted him with sumptuous
gifts. And all displeasure in the Sultan’s heart being
removed from the Wazir he committed to him once more the
management of all his affairs.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7442" id="noteref-7442" epub:type="noteref">7442</a> But when Ibn Ahyam (continued
Shahrazad) had ended his history of the Righteous Wazir he
