			<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Gentlemen,</p>
			<p>I take the liberty of placing your names at the head of this Volume which owes its rarest and raciest passages to your kindly refusing the temporary transfer of the Wortley Montague <abbr>MS.</abbr> from your pleasant library to the care of <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Rost, Chief Librarian, India Office. As a sop to “bigotry and virtue,” as a concession to the “Scribes and Pharisees,” I had undertaken, in case the loan were granted, not to translate tales and passages which might expose you, the Curators, to unfriendly comment. But, possibly anticipating what injury would thereby accrue to the Volume and what sorrow to my subscribers, you were good enough not to sanction the transfer⁠—indeed you refused it to me twice⁠—and for this step my clientele will be (or ought to be) truly thankful to you.</p>
