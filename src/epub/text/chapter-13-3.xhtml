<p>Quoth Dunyazad, “O sister mine, how rare is thy tale and delectable!”
and quoth Shahrazad, “And what is this compared with
that I could relate to you after the coming night, an this my lord
the King deign leave me on life?” So Shahryar said to himself,
“Indeed I will not slay her until she tell me the whole tale.”</p>

<p>Shahrazad began to relate the adventures of</p>

<h3 class="c014"><em>KHUDADAD<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6462" id="noteref-6462" epub:type="noteref">6462</a> AND HIS BROTHERS.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">Said she, O auspicious King, this my tale relateth to the Kingdom
of Diyár Bakr<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6463" id="noteref-6463" epub:type="noteref">6463</a> in whose capital-city of Harrán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6464" id="noteref-6464" epub:type="noteref">6464</a> dwelt a Sultan of illustrious
lineage, a protector of the people, a lover of his lieges, a friend
of mankind and renowned for being gifted with every good quality.
Now Allah Almighty had bestowed upon him all that his heart could
desire, save boon of child, for though he had lovely wives within his
Harem-door and fair concubines galore, he had not been blessed
with a son; wherefor he offered up incessant worship to the Creator.
One night there appeared to him in a dream a man of comely
visage and holy of semblance like unto a prophet, who addressed
him, saying, “O puissant King, thy vows are at length heard.
Arise to-morrow at day-dawn, pray a two-bow prayer and offer up
thy petitions; then haste thee to the Chief Gardener of thy palace
and require of him a pomegranate whereof do thou eat as many
seeds as seemeth best to thee; after which perform another two-bow
prayer, and Allah will shower favours and graces upon thy
head.” The King, awaking at peep of day, called to mind the
vision of the night, and returning thanks to the Almighty, made
his orisons and kneeling invoked a benedicite. Then he rose and
repaired to the garth, and receiving a pomegranate from the Head-Gardener,
counted out and ate fifty grains thereof; to wit, one for
each of his wives. After this he lay the night in turn with them
all and by the omnipotence of the Creator all gave in due time
signs of pregnancy, save one Firúzah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6465" id="noteref-6465" epub:type="noteref">6465</a> hight. So the King conceived
a grudge against her, saying in his soul, “Allah holdeth this woman
vile and accursed and He willeth not that she become the mother of
a Prince, and on this wise hath the curse of barrenness become her
lot.” He would have had her done to death but the Grand Wazir
made intercession for her and suggested to the Sultan that perchance
Firuzah might prove with child and withal not show outward signal
thereof, as is the manner of certain women; wherefore to slay her
might be to destroy a Prince with the mother. Quoth the King,
“So be it! slay her not, but take heed that she abide no longer or at
court or in the city, for I cannot support the sight of her.” Replied
the Minister, “It shall be done even as thy Highness biddeth: let
her be conveyed to the care of thy brother’s son, Prince Samír.”
The King did according to the counsel of his Wazir and despatched
his loathed Queen to Samaria<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6466" id="noteref-6466" epub:type="noteref">6466</a> accompanied by a writ with the
following purport, to his nephew, “We forward this lady to thy
care: entreat her honourably and, shouldest thou remark tokens of
pregnancy in her, see that thou acquaint us therewith without stay
or delay.” So Firuzah journeyed to Samaria, and when her time
was fulfilled she gave birth to a boy babe, and became the mother
of a Prince who in favour was resplendent as the sheeny day.
Hereat the lord of Samaria sent message by letter to the Sultan of
Harran saying, “A Prince hath been borne by the womb of Firuzah:
Allah Almighty give thee permanence of prosperity!” By these
tidings the King was filled with joy; and presently he replied to
his cousin, Prince Samir, “Each one of my forty-and-nine spouses
hath been blessed with issue and it delighteth me beyond bounds
that Firuzah hath also given me a son. Let him be named
Khudadad—God’s gift—do thou have due care of him and whatsoever
thou mayest need for his birth-ceremonies shall be counted out
to thee without regard to cost.” Accordingly Prince Samir took in
hand with all pleasure and delight the charge of Prince Khudadad;
and, as soon as the child reached the age for receiving instruction,
he caused him to be taught cavalarice and archery and all such
arts and sciences which it behoveth the sons of the Kings to learn,
so that he became perfect in all manner knowledge. At eighteen
years of age he waxed seemly of semblance and such were his
strength and valiance that none in the whole world could compare
with him. Presently, feeling himself gifted with unusual vigour and
virile character he addressed one day of the days Firuzah his parent,
saying, “O mother mine, grant me thy leave to quit Samaria and
fare in quest of fortune, especially of some battle-field where I may
prove the force and prowess of me. My sire, the Sultan of Harran,
hath many foes, some of whom are lusting to wage war with him;
and I marvel that at such time he doth not summon me and make
me his aid in this mightiest of matters. But seeing that I possess
such courage and Allah-given strength it behoveth me not to remain
thus idly at home. My father knoweth naught of my lustihood,
nor forsooth doth he think of me at all; nevertheless ’tis suitable
that at such a time I present myself before him, and tender my
services until my brothers be fit to fight and to front his foes.”
Hereto his mother made answer, “O my dear son, thine absence
pleaseth me not, but in truth it becometh thee to help thy father
against the enemies who are attacking him on all sides, provided
that he send for thine aidance.”——And as the morn began to
dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that
Khudadad replied to his mother Firuzah, “Indeed I am unable to
brook delay; moreover such longing have I in heart to look upon
the Sultan, my sire, that an I go not and visit him and kiss his
feet I shall assuredly die. I will enter his employ as a stranger
and all unknown to him, nor will I inform him that I am his son;
but I shall be to him as a foreigner or as one of his hired knaves,
and with such devotion will I do him suit and service that, when
he learneth that I am indeed his child, he may grant me his favour
and affection.” Prince Samir also would not suffer him to depart
and forbade him therefrom; but one day of the days the Prince
suddenly set out from Samaria under pretext that he was about
to hunt and chase. He mounted a milk-white steed, whose reins
and stirrups were of gold and the saddle and housings were
of azure satin dubbed with jewels and fringed with pendants of
fresh pearls. His scymitar was hilted with a single diamond, the
scabbard of chaunders-wood was crusted with rubies and emeralds
and it depended from a gemmed waist-belt; while his bow and
richly wrought quiver hung by his side. Thus equipped and
escorted by his friends and familiars he presently arrived at
Harran-city after the fairest fashion; and, when occasion offered
itself, he made act of presence before the King and did his
obeisance at Darbár. The Sultan, remarking his beauty and
comeliness, or haply by reason of an outburst of natural affection,
was pleased to return his salam; and, graciously calling him to
his side, asked of him his name and pedigree, whereto Khudadad
answered, “O my liege, I am the son of an Emir of Cairo. A
longing for travel hath made me quit my native place and wander
from clime to clime till at length I have come hither; and, hearing
that thou hast matters of importance in hand, I am desirous of
approving to thee my valiancy.” The King joyed with exceeding
joy to hear this stout and doughty speech, and forthwith gave
him a post of command in his army; and Khudadad by careful
supervision of the troops soon won the esteem of his officers by
his desire to satisfy them and the hearts of his soldiers by reason
of his strength and courage, his goodly nature and his kindly
disposition. He also brought the host and all its equipments and
munitions of warfare into such excellent order and method that
the King on inspecting them was delighted and created the
stranger Chief Commandant of the forces and made him an
especial favourite; while the Wazirs and Emirs, also the Nabobs
and the Notables, perceiving that he was highly reputed and regarded,
showed him abundant good will and affection. Presently,
the other Princes, who became of no account in the eyes of the King
and the lieges, waxed envious of his high degree and dignity.
But Khudadad ceased not to please the Sultan his sire, at all
times when they conversed together, by his prudence and discretion,
his wit and wisdom, and gained his regard ever more and
more; and when the invaders, who had planned a raid on the
realm, heard of the discipline of the army and of Khudadad’s
provisions for materials of war, they abstained from all hostile
intent. After a while the King committed to Khudadad the
custody and education of the forty-nine Princes, wholly relying on
his sagesse and skill; and thus, albeit Khudadad was of age like
his brothers, he became their master by reason of his sapience and
good sense. Whereupon they hated him but the more; and, when
taking counsel one day, quoth one to other, “What be this thing
our sire hath done that he should make a stranger-wight his cup-companion
and set him to lord it over us? We can do naught
save by leave of this our governor, and our condition is past
bearing; so contrive we to rid ourselves of this foreigner and at
least render him vile and contemptible in the eyes of our sire
the Sultan.” Said one, “Let us gather together and slay him in
some lonely spot;” and said another, “Not so! to kill him would
benefit us naught, for how could we keep the matter hidden from
the King? He would become our enemy and Allah only wotteth
what evil might befal us. Nay, rather let us crave permission of him
and fare a-hunting and then tarry we in some far-off town; and
after a while the King will marvel at our absence, then grief will
be sore upon him and at length, waxing displeased and suspicious,
he will have this fellow expelled the palace or haply done to
death. This is the only sure and safe way of bringing about
his destruction.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad
held her peace till</p>

    <div>The end of the Five Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
forty-and-nine brothers agreed to hold this plan the wisest and,
presently going together to Khudadad, asked leave of him to
ride about the country awhile or fare to the chase, promising they
would return by set of sun. He fell into the snare and allowed
them to go; whereupon they sallied forth a-hunting but did not
come back that day or the next. On the third morning the King
who missed them asked Khudadad wherefore it was that none of
his sons were to be seen; and he answered that three days before
they had gotten leave from him to go a-hunting and had not
returned. Hereat the father was perplexed with sore perplexity;
and, when sundry days more had passed by and still the Princes
appeared not, the old Sultan was much troubled in mind and
hardly restraining his rage summoned Khudadad and in hot wrath
exclaimed, “O thou neglectful stranger, what courage and over-daring
is this of thine that thou didst suffer my sons fare to the
chace and didst not ride with them. And now ’tis but right that
thou set out and search for them and bring them back; otherwise
thou shalt surely die.” Khudadad, hearing these harsh words, was
startled and alarmed; however he got him ready and mounted
his horse forthwith and left the city in quest of the Princes his
brethren, wandering about from country to country, like unto a
herd seeking a straying flock of goats. Presently, not finding any
trace of them in homestead or on desert-ground, he became sad
and sorrowful exceedingly, saying in his soul, “O my brothers,
what hath befallen you and where can ye be dwelling? Perchance
some mighty foeman hath made you prisoners so that ye cannot
escape; and I may never return unto Harran till I find you; for
this will be a matter of bitter regret and repine to the King.” So
he repented more and more having suffered them to go without
his escort and guidance. At length whilst searching for them
from plain to plain and forest to forest he chanced come upon a
large and spacious prairie in the middlemost whereof rose a castle
of black marble; so he rode on at a foot pace and when close
under the walls he espied a lady of passing beauty and loveliness
who was seated at a window in melancholy plight and with no
other ornament than her own charms. Her lovely hair hung down
in dishevelled locks; her raiment was tattered and her favour was
pale and showed sadness and sorrow. Withal she was speaking
under her breath and Khudadad, giving attentive ear, heard her say
these words, “O youth, fly this fatal site, else thou wilt fall into the
hands of the monster who dwelleth here; a man-devouring Ethiopian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6467" id="noteref-6467" epub:type="noteref">6467</a>
is lord of this palace; and he seizeth all whom Fate sendeth
to this prairie and locketh them up in darksome and narrow cells
that he may preserve them for food.” Khudadad exclaimed,
“O my lady, tell me I pray thee who thou art and whereabouts
was thy home;” and she answered, “I am a daughter of Cairo
and of the noblest thereof. But lately, as I wended my way to
Baghdad, I alighted upon this plain and met that Habashi, who
slew all my servants and carrying me off by force placed me in
this palace. I no longer care to live, and a thousand times better
were it for me to die; for that this Abyssinian lusteth to enjoy me
and albeit to the present time I have escaped the caresses of the
impure wretch, to-morrow an I still refuse to gratify his desire he
will surely ravish me and do me dead. So I have given up all
hope of safety; but thou, why hast thou come hither to perish?
Escape without stay or delay, for he hath gone forth in quest of
wayfarers and right soon will he return. Moreover he can see far
and wide and can descry all who traverse this wold.” Now hardly
had the lady spoken these words when the Abyssinian drew in
sight; and he was as a Ghúl of the Wild, big of bulk, and fearsome
of favour and figure, and he mounted a sturdy Tartar steed,
brandishing, as he rode, a weighty blade which none save he could
wield. Prince Khudadad seeing this monstrous semblance was
sore amazed and prayed Heaven that he might be victorious over
that devil: then unsheathing his sword he stood awaiting the
Abyssinian’s approach with courage and steadfastness; but the
blackamoor when he drew near deemed the Prince too slight and
puny to fight and was minded to seize him alive. Khudadad,
seeing how his foe had no intent to combat, struck him with his
sword on the knee a stroke so dour that the negro foamed with
rage and yelled a yell so loud that the whole prairie resounded
with the plaint. Thereupon the brigand, fiery with fury, rose
straight in his shovel-stirrups and struck fiercely at Khudadad
with his huge sword and, but for the Prince’s cunning of fence and
the cleverness of his courser, he would have been sliced in twain
like unto a cucumber. Though the scymitar whistled through the
air, the blow was harmless, and in an eye-twinkling Khudadad
dealt him a second cut and struck off his right hand which fell to
the ground with the sword hilt it gripped, when the blackamoor
losing his balance rolled from the saddle and made earth resound
with the fall. Thereupon the Prince sprang from his steed and
deftly severing the enemy’s head from his body threw it aside.
Now the lady had been looking down at the lattice rigid in prayer
for the gallant youth; and, seeing the Abyssinian slain and the
Prince victorious, she was overcome with exceeding joy and cried
but to her deliverer, “Praise be to Almighty Allah, O my lord,
who by thy hand hath defeated and destroyed this fiend. Come
now to me within the castle, whose keys are with the Abyssinian; so
take them and open the door and deliver me.” Khudadad found
a large bunch of keys under the dead man’s girdle wherewith he
opened the portals of the fort and entered a large saloon in which
was the lady; and, no sooner did she behold him than running to
meet him she was about to cast herself at his feet and kiss them
when Khudadad prevented her. She praised him with highest
praise and extolled him for valiancy above all the champions of
the world, and he returned the salam to her who, when seen near
hand seemed endued with more grace and charms than had
appeared from afar. So the Prince joyed with extreme joy
and the twain sat down in pleasant converse. Presently,
Khudadad heard shrieks and cries and weeping and wailing with
groans and moans and ever loudening lamentations; so he asked
the lady, saying, “Whence are these clamours and from whom
come these pitiful complaints?” And, she pointing to a wicket in
a hidden corner of the court below, answered, saying, “O my lord,
these sounds come therefrom. Many wretches driven by Destiny
have fallen into the clutches of the Abyssinian Ghúl and are
securely locked up in cells, and each day he was wont to roast
and eat one of the captives.” “’Twill please me vastly,” quoth
Khudadad, “to be the means of their deliverance: come, O my
lady, and show me where they are imprisoned.” Thereupon the
twain drew near to the place and the Prince forthright tried a key
upon the lock of the dungeon but it did not fit; then he made
essay of another wherewith they opened the wicket. As they
were so doing the report of the captives’ moaning and groaning
increased yet more and more until Khudadad, touched and
troubled at their impatience, asked the cause of it. The lady
replied, “O my lord, hearing our footsteps and the rattling of the
key in the lock they deem that the cannibal, according to his
custom, hath come to supply them with food and to secure one
of them for his evening meal. Each feareth lest his turn for
roasting be come, so all are affrighted with sore affright and
redouble their shouts and cries.”——And as the morn began to
dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The end of the Five Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
sounds from that secret place seemed to issue from under ground
or from the depths of a draw-well. But when the Prince opened
the dungeon door, he espied a steep staircase and descending
thereby found himself in a deep pit, narrow and darksome,
wherein were penned more than an hundred persons with elbows
pinioned and members chained; nor saw he aught of light save
through one bull’s-eye. So he cried to them, “O ye unfortunates,
fear ye no more! I have slain the Abyssinian; and render ye praise
to Allah Almighty who hath rid you of your wrong-doer: also I
come to strike off your fetters and return you to freedom.” Hearing
these glad tidings the prisoners were in raptures of delight
and raised a general cry of joy and jubilee. Hereupon Khudadad
and the lady began to loose their hands and feet; and each, as
he was released from his durance, helped to unchain his fellows:
brief, after a moment of time all were delivered from their bonds
and bondage. Then each and every kissed Khudadad’s feet and
gave thanks and prayed for his welfare; and when those whilom
prisoners entered the court-yard whereupon the sun was shining
sheen, Khudadad recognised amongst them his brothers, in quest
of whom he had so long wandered. He was amazed with exceeding
amazement and exclaimed, “Laud be to the Lord, that I have
found you one and all safe and sound: your father is sorely
sad and sorrowful at your absence; and Heaven forfend that this
devil hath devoured any from amongst you.” He then counted
their number, forty-and-nine, and set them apart from the rest; and
all in excess of joy fell upon one another’s necks and ceased not to
embrace their saviour. After this the Prince spread a feast for the
captives, each and every, whom he had delivered; and, when they
had eaten and drunken their full, he restored to them the gold
and silver, the Turkey carpets and pieces of Chinese silk and
brocade and other valuables innumerable which the Abyssinian had
plundered from the caravans, as also their own personal goods
and chattels, directing each man to claim his own; and what
remained he divided equally amongst them. “But,” quoth he,
“by what means can ye convey these bales to your own countries,
and where can ye find beasts of burden in this wild wold?”
Quoth they, “O our Lord, the Abyssinian robbed us of our camels
with their loads and doubtless they are in the stables of the
castle.” Hereupon Khudadad fared forth with them to the stables
and there found tethered and tied not only the camels but also
the forty-nine horses of his brothers the princes, and accordingly
he gave to each one his own animal. There were moreover in the
stables hundreds of Abyssinian slave-boys who, seeing the prisoners
released, were certified that their lord the cannibal was slain and
fled in dismay to the forest and none thought of giving chase to
them. So the merchants loaded their merchandise upon the
camels’ backs and farewelling the Prince set out for their own
countries. Then quoth Khudadad to the lady, “O thou rare in
beauty and chastity, whence earnest thou when the Abyssinian
seized thee and whither now wouldst thou wend? Inform me
thereof that I may restore thee to thy home; haply these Princes,
my brethren, sons of the Sultan of Harran, know thine abode;
and doubtless they will escort thee thither.” The lady turning to
Khudadad presently made answer, “I live far from here and my
country, the land of Egypt, is over distant for travel. But thou,
O valorous Prince, hast delivered mine honour and my life from
the hands of the Abyssinian and hast shown me such favour that
’twould ill become me to conceal from thee my history. I am
the daughter of a mighty king; reigning over the Sa’íd or upper
Nile-land; and when a tyrant foeman seized him and, reaving
him of life as well as of his realm, usurped his throne and seized
his kingdom, I fled away to preserve my existence and mine
honour.” Thereupon Khudadad and his brothers prayed the lady
to recount all that had befallen her and reassured her, saying,
“Henceforth thou shalt live in solace and luxury: neither toil
nor trouble shall betide thee.” When she saw that there was no
help for her but to tell all her tale, she began in the following
words to recount the</p>

<h3 class="c014"><em>HISTORY OF THE PRINCESS OF DARYABAR.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6468" id="noteref-6468" epub:type="noteref">6468</a></h3>

<p class="c017">In an island of the islands standeth a great city called Daryábár,
wherein dwelt a king of exalted degree. But despite his virtue
and his valour he was ever sad and sorrowful having naught of
offspring, and he offered up without surcease prayers on that
behalf. After long years and longsome supplications a half boon
was granted to him; to wit, a daughter (myself) was born. My
father who grieved sore at first presently rejoiced with joy
exceeding at the unfortunate ill-fated birth of me; and, when I
came of age to learn, he bade me be taught to read and write;
and caused me to be instructed in court-ceremonial and royal
duties and the chronicles of the past, to the intent that I might
succeed him as heiress to his throne and his kingship. Now it
happened one day that my sire rode out a-hunting and gave
chase to a wild ass<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6469" id="noteref-6469" epub:type="noteref">6469</a> with such hot pursuit that he found himself
at eventide separated from his suite; so, wearied with the chase,
he dismounted from his steed and seating himself by the side of a
forest-path, he said to himself, “The onager will doubtless seek
cover in this copse.” Suddenly he espied a light shining bright
amidst the trees and, thinking that a hamlet might be hard by, he
was minded to night there and at day-dawn to determine his further
course. Hereupon he arose and walking towards the light he
found that it issued from a lonely hut in the forest; then peering
into the inside he espied an Abyssinian burly of bulk and in semblance
like unto a Satan, seated upon a divan. Before him were
ranged many capacious jars full of wine and over a fire of charcoal
he was roasting a bullock whole and eating the flesh and ever and
anon drinking deep draughts from one of the pitchers. Furthermore
the King sighted in that hut a lady of exquisite beauty and
comeliness sitting in a corner direly distressed: her hands were
fast bound with cords, and at her feet a child of two or three years
of age lay beweeping his mother’s sorry plight.——And as the morn
began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that seeing
the doleful state of these twain, my sire was filled with ruth and
longed to fall upon the ogre sword in hand; however, not being
able to cope with him he restrained his wrath and remained on
stealthy watch. The giant having drained all the pitchers of wine
and devoured half of the barbacued bullock presently addressed
himself to the lady and said, “O loveliest of Princesses how long,
wilt thou prove thee coy and keep aloof from me? Dost thou not
see how desirous I am of winning thy heart and how I am dying for
the love of thee? ’Tis therefore only right that thou also shouldst
return my affection and know me as thine own, when I will become
to thee the kindest of mankind.” “O thou Ghul of the waste,” cried
the lady, “what be this whereof thou pratest? Never; no, never
shalt thou win thy wish of me, however much thou mayest lust
therefor. Torment me or, an thou wilt, destroy me downright, but
for my part I will on no wise yield me to thy lusts.” At these
words the infuriated savage roared aloud, “’Tis enough and more
than enough: thy hate breedeth hatred in me and now I desire
less to have and hold thee than to do thee die.” Then he seized
her with one hand, and drawing his sabre with the other, would
have struck off her head from her body when my father shot at
him a shaft so deftly that it pierced his heart and came out gleaming
at his back and he fell to the ground and found instant
admission into Jahannam. Hereupon my sire entered the hut
and unbinding the lady’s bonds enquired of her who she was and
by what means that ogre had brought her thither. Answered she,
“Not far from this site there liveth on the sea-shore a race of
Saracens, like unto the demons of the desert. Sorely against my
will I was wedded to their Prince and the fulsome villain thou hast
now slain was one of my husband’s chief officers. He fell madly
in love to me and he longed with excessive longing to get me
into his power and to carry me off from my home. Accordingly,
one day of the days when my husband was out of the way and I
was in privacy, he carried me off with this my babe from the palace
to this wild wood wherein is none save He<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6470" id="noteref-6470" epub:type="noteref">6470</a> and where well he wot
that all search and labour would be baffled; then, hour after hour
he designed guilty designs against me, but by the mercy of
Almighty Allah I have ever escaped all carnal soil of that foul
monster. This evening, in despair of my safety, I was rejecting
his brutal advances when he attempted to take my life and in the
attempt he was slain by thy valorous hand. This is then my
story which I have told thee.” My father reassured the Princess,
saying, “O my lady, let thy heart be at ease; at daybreak I will
take thee away from this wilderness and escort thee to Daryabar,
of which city I am the Sultan; and, shouldst thou become fain of
that place, then dwell therein until thy husband shall come in
quest of thee.” Quoth the lady, “O my lord, this plan doth not
displease me.” So with the earliest light next morning my father
took mother and child away from that forest and set forth homewards
when suddenly he fell in with his Sirdars and officers who
had been wandering hither and thither during the livelong night
in search of him. They rejoiced with great joy on seeing the King
and marvelled with exceeding marvel at the sight of a veiled one
with him, admiring much that so lovesome a lady should be found
dwelling in a wold so wild. Thereupon the King related to them
the tale of the ogre and of the Princess and how he had slain the
blackamoor. Presently they set forth on their homeward way;
one of the Emirs seating the dame behind him on his horse’s
crupper while another took charge of the child. They reached the
royal city, where the King ordered a large and splendid mansion to
be built for his guest, the babe also received a suitable education;
and thus the mother passed her days in perfect comfort and
happiness. After the lapse of some months, when no tidings, however
fondly expected, came of her husband, she resigned herself to
marrying my father whom she had captivated by her beauty and
loveliness and amorous liveliness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6471" id="noteref-6471" epub:type="noteref">6471</a> whereupon he wedded her, and
when the marriage-contract was drawn up (as was customary in
those days), they sojourned together in one stead. As time went
on the lad grew up to be a lusty youth of handsome mien; moreover
he became perfect in courtly ceremonial and in every art and
science that befit Princes. The King and all the Ministers and
Emirs highly approved of him, and determined that I should be
married to him, and that he should succeed the sovereign as
heir to throne and kingship. The youth also was well pleased
with such tokens of favour from my father, but chiefly he
rejoiced with exceeding joy to hear talk of his union with his
protector’s only daughter. One day my sire desired to place my
hand in his to the intent that the marriage ceremony should at
once take place, but first he would impose upon my suitor certain
conditions, whereof one was that he should wed none other but
his wife’s daughter, that is, myself. This pledge displeased the
haughty youth, who forthwith refused his consent thereto, deeming
himself by the demand of such condition a despised and contemptible
suitor of villain birth.——And as the morn began to

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that, the lady
continued:—On this wise the wedding was deferred, and this delay
became a matter of sore displeasure to the young man, who thought
in his heart that my father was his foe. Therefore he ever strove
to lure him into his power till one day in a frenzy of rage he slew
him and proclaimed himself King of Daryabar. Moreover the
murtherer would have entered my chamber to kill me also had not
the Wazir, a true and faithful servant of the crown, at the tidings
of his liege lord’s death speedily taken me away, and hidden me in
the house of a friend where he bade me remain concealed. Two
days afterwards, having fitted out a ship, he embarked me therein
with a Kahramánah—an old duenna—and set sail for a country
whose King was of my father’s friends, to the intent that he might
consign me to his charge, and obtain from him the aid of an
army wherewith he might avenge himself upon the ungrateful and
ungracious youth who had proved himself a traitor to the salt.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6472" id="noteref-6472" epub:type="noteref">6472</a>
But a few days after our weighing anchor a furious storm began to
blow making the captain and crew sore confounded and presently
the waves beat upon the vessel with such exceeding violence that
she brake up, and the Wazir and the duenna and all who were
therein (save myself) were drowned in the billows. But I, albeit
well nigh a-swoon, clung to a plank and was shortly after washed
ashore by the send of the sea, for Allah of His mighty power had
preserved me safe and sound from death-doom by the raging of the
ocean, to the end that further troubles might befal me. When I
returned to sense and consciousness, I found myself alive on the
strand and offered up grateful thanks to Almighty Allah; but not
seeing the Wazir or any one of the company I knew that they
had perished in the waters.——And as the morn began to dawn

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princess of Daryabar continued:—Presently, calling to remembrance
the murther of my father I cried aloud with an exceeding
bitter cry and was sore afraid at my lonesome plight, insomuch that
I would fain have cast myself again into the sea, when suddenly the
voice of man and tramp of horse-hooves fell upon my ears. Then
looking about I descried a band of cavaliers in the midst of whom
was a handsome prince: he was mounted upon a steed of purest
Rabite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6473" id="noteref-6473" epub:type="noteref">6473</a> blood and was habited in a gold-embroidered surcoat; a
girdle studded with diamonds girt his loins and on his head was a
crown of gold; in fine it was evident from his garb as from his
aspect that he was a born ruler of mankind. Thereupon, seeing me
all alone on the sea-shore, the knights marvelled with exceeding
marvel; then the Prince detached one of his captains to ascertain
my history and acquaint him therewith; but albeit the officer
plied me with questions I answered him not a word and shed
a flood of tears in the deepest silence. So noting the waifage on
the sand they thought to themselves, “Perchance some vessel hath
been wrecked upon this shore and its planks and timber have been
cast up on the land, and doubtless this lady was in that ship and
hath been floated ashore on some plank.” Whereupon the cavaliers
crowded around me and implored me to relate unto them
what had befallen me; nevertheless I still answered them not a
word. Presently the Prince himself drew near to me and, much
amazed, sent away his suite from about me and addressed me in
these words, “O my lady, fear naught of ill from me nor distress
thyself by needless affright. I would convey thee to my home
and under my mother’s care; wherefore I am curious to know of
thee who thou art. The Queen will assuredly befriend thee and
keep thee in comfort and happiness.” And now understanding
that his heart was drawn towards me, I told him all that had
betided me, and he on hearing the story of my sad destiny became
moved with the deepest emotion and his eyes brimmed with tears.
Then he comforted me and carried me with him and committed
me to the Queen his mother, who also lent kindly ear to my tale of
the past, first and last, and hearing it she also was greatly grieved,
and wearied not day or night in tending me and (as far as in her lay)
striving to make me happy. Seeing, moreover, that her son was
deeply enamoured of me and love-distraught she agreed to my
becoming his wife, while I also consented when I looked upon
his handsome and noble face and figure and to his proved affection
for me and his goodness of heart. Accordingly, in due time the
marriage was celebrated with royal pomp and circumstance. But
what escape is there from Fate? On that very night, the night of
the wedding, a King of Zanzibar who dwelt hard by that island,
and had erewhile practised against the kingdom, seizing his opportunity,
attacked us with a mighty army, and having put many to
death, bethought him to take me and my husband alive. But we
escaped from his hands and fleeing under the murks of night to the
sea-shore found there a fisherman’s boat, which we entered thanking
our stars and launched it and floated far away on the current,
unknowing whither Destiny was directing us. On the third day
we espied a vessel making us, whereat we rejoiced with joy excessive,
deeming her to be some merchantman coming to our
aidance. No sooner had it lain alongside, however, than up there
sprang five or six pirates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6474" id="noteref-6474" epub:type="noteref">6474</a> each brandishing a naked brand in
hand, and boarding us tied our arms behind us and carried us to
their craft. They then tare the veil from my face and forthwith
desired to possess me, each saying to other, “I will enjoy this
wench.” On this wise wrangling and jangling ensued till right
soon it turned to battle and bloodshed, when moment by moment
and one by one the ravishers fell dead until all were slain save a
single pirate, the bravest of the band. Quoth he to me, “Thou
shalt fare with me to Cairo where dwelleth a friend of mine and to
him will I give thee, for erewhile I promised him that on this
voyage I would secure for him a fair woman for handmaid.”
Then seeing my husband, whom the pirates had left in bonds he
exclaimed, “Who may be this hound? Is he to thee a lover or a
friend?” and I made answer “He is my wedded husband.” “’Tis
well,” cried he: “in very sooth it behoveth me to release him
from the bitter pangs of jealousy and the sight of thee enfolded
in another’s fond embrace.” Whereat the ruffian raised aloft the
ill-fated Prince, bound foot and hand, and cast him into the sea,
while I shrieked aloud and implored his mercy, but all in vain.
Seeing the Prince struggling and drowning in the waves I cried out
and screamed and buffetted my face and tare my hair and would
fain have cast myself into the waters but I could not, for he held me
fast and lashed me to the mainmast. Then, pursuing our course
with favouring winds we soon arrived at a small port-village where
he bought camels and boy-slaves and journeyed on towards Cairo;
but when several stages of the road were left behind us, the Abyssinian
who dwelt in this castle suddenly overtook us. From afar
we deemed him to be a lofty tower, and when near us could hardly
believe him to be a human being.——And as the morn began to
dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princess of Daryabar continued:—At once unsheathing his huge
sword the Habashi made for the pirate and ordered him to surrender
himself prisoner, with me and all his slaves, and with pinioned
elbows to accompany him. Hereat the robber with hot courage
and heading his followers rushed fiercely on the Abyssinian, and
for a long time the fight raged thick and fast, till he and his lay
dead upon the field; whereupon the Abyssinian led off the camels
and carried me and the pirate’s corpse to this castle, and devoured
the flesh of his foe at his evening meal. Then turning to me as I
wept with bitter weeping he said, “Banish from thy breast this woe
and this angry mood; and abide in this castle at perfect ease and
in comfort, and solace thyself with my embraces. However, since
thou appearest at this present to be in dire distress, I will excuse
thee for to-night, but without fail I shall require thee of thyself on
the morrow.” He then led me into a separate chamber and locking
fast the gates and doors, fell asleep alone in another place. Arising
early on the next morning he searched the castle round about
unlocked the wicket which he closed again and sallied forth,
according to his custom, in quest of wayfarers. But the caravan
escaped him and anon he returned empty-handed when thou didst
set upon him and slay him. On this wise the Princess of Daryabar
related her history to Prince Khudadad who was moved with
ruth for her: then comforting her he said, “Henceforth fear
naught nor be on any wise dismayed. These princes are the sons of
the King of Harran; and if it please thee, let them lead thee to his
court and stablish thee in comfort and luxury: the King also will
guard thee from all evil. Or, shouldest thou be loath to fare with
them, wilt thou not consent to take for spouse him who hath
rescued thee from so great calamity?” The Princess of Daryabar
consented to wed with him and forthwith the marriage was celebrated
with grand display in the castle and here they found meats
and drinks of sundry sorts, and delicious fruits and fine wines
wherewith the cannibal would regale himself when a-weary of
man’s flesh. So Khudadad made ready dishes of every colour
and feasted his brothers. Next day taking with them such provaunt
as was at hand, all set forth for Harran, and at the close of
each stage they chose a suitable stead for nighting; and, when but
one day’s journey lay before them, the Princes supped that night
off what was left to them of their viaticum and drained all the
wine that remained. But when the drink had mastered their wits,
Khudadad thus addressed his brothers, saying, “Hitherto have I
withheld from you the secret of my birth, which now I must
disclose. Know ye then that I am your brother, for I also am
a son of the King of Harran, whom the Lord of Samaria-land
brought up and bade educate; and lastly, my mother is the
Princess Firuzah.” Then to the Princess of Daryabar, “Thou
didst not recognise my rank and pedigree and, had I discovered
myself erewhile, haply thou hadst been spared the mortification of
being wooed by a man of vulgar blood. But now ease thy mind
for that thy husband is a Prince.” Quoth she, “Albeit thou
discoveredst to me naught until this time, still my heart felt
assured that thou wast of noble birth and the son of some potent
sovereign.” The Princes one and all appeared outwardly well
pleased and offered each and every warm congratulations whilst
the wedding was celebrating; but inwardly they were filled with
envy and sore annoy at such unwelcome issue of events, so much
so that when Khudadad retired with the Princess of Daryabar to
his tent and slept, those ingrates, forgetful of the service rendered
to them by their brother in that he had rescued them when
prisoners in the hands of the man-devouring Abyssinian, remained
deep in thought and seeking a safe place took counsel one with
other to kill him. Quoth the foremost of them, “O my brethren,
our father showed him the liveliest affection when he was to us
naught save a vagrant and unknown, and indeed made him our
ruler and our governor; and now, hearing of his victory won from
the ogre and learning that the stranger is his son, will not our sire
forthwith appoint this bastard his only heir and give him dominion
over us so that we must all be forced to fall at his feet and bear his
yoke? My rede is this that we make an end of him in this very
spot.” Accordingly they stole softly into his tent and dealt him
from every side strokes with their swords, so that they slashed
him in every limb and fondly thought that they had left him dead
on the bed without their awaking the Princess. Next morning
they entered the city of Harran and made their salams to the
King, who despaired of sighting them again, so he rejoiced with
exceeding joy on seeing them restored to him safe and sound and
sane, and asked why they had tarried from him so long. In reply
they carefully concealed from him their being thrown into the
dungeon by the Ghul of Abyssinia and how Khudadad had
rescued them: on the contrary all declared that they had been
delayed whilst a-hunting and a-visiting the adjacent cities and
countries. So the Sultan gave full credence to their account and
held his peace. Such was their case; but as regards Khudadad,
when the Princess of Daryabar awoke in the morning she found
her bridegroom lying drowned in blood gashed and pierced with
a score of wounds.——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad
held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The end of the full Six Hundredth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that, the
Princess, deeming her bridegroom dead, wept at this sight right
sore; and, calling to mind his youth and beauty, his valour and his
many virtues, she washed his face with her tears and exclaimed,
“Well-away and woe is me, O my lover, O Khudadad, do these
eyes look upon thee in sudden and violent death? Are these thy
brothers (the devils!) whom thy courage hath saved, the destroyers
of thee? Nay ’tis I am thy murtheress; I who suffered thee to
ally thy Fate with my hapless destiny, a lot that doometh to
destruction all who befriend me.” Then considering the body
attentively she perceived that breath was slowly coming and
going through his nostrils, and that his limbs were yet warm.
So she made fast the tent-door and ran city-wards to seek a
surgeon, and anon having found a skilful leech, she returned with
him, but lo and behold! Khudadad was missing. She wist not
what had become of him, but thought in her mind that some wild
beast had carried him off; then she wept bitterly and bemoaned
her mishap, so that the surgeon was moved to ruth and with words
of comfort and consolation offered her house and service; and
lastly he bore her to the town and assigned to her a separate
dwelling. He also appointed two slave-girls to wait upon her,
and albeit he knew naught of her condition he was ever in attendance
on her with the honour and homage due to the kings. One
day, she being somewhat less sad of heart, the surgeon, who had
now informed himself of her condition, asked her, saying, “O my
lady, be pleased to acquaint me with thine estate and thy misfortunes,
and as far as in me lieth I will strive to aid and succour
thee.” And she, observing the leech to be shrewd and trustworthy
withal, made known to him her story. Quoth the surgeon,
“An it be thy wish, I would gladly escort thee to thy father-in-law
the King of Harran, who is indeed a wise sovereign and a just; and
he will rejoice to see thee and will take vengeance on the unnatural
Princes, his sons, for the blood of thy husband unjustly shed.”
These words pleased well the Princess; so the surgeon hired two
dromedaries which they mounted and the twain set forth for
the city of Harran. Alighting that same evening at a caravanserai
the leech asked what news had come from town; and the Keeper
answered, “The King of Harran had a son passing valiant and
accomplished who abode with him for some years as a stranger;
but lately he was lost, nor doth any know of him whether he be
dead or alive. The Princess Firuzah his mother hath sent all-wheres
in search of him, yet hath she found nor trace nor tidings
of him. His parents and indeed all the folk, rich and poor,
weep and wail for him and albeit the Sultan hath other forty and
nine sons, none of them can compare with him for doughty deeds
and skilful craft, nor from any one of them deriveth he aught of
comfort or consolation. Full quest and search have been made
but hitherto all hath been in vain.” The surgeon thereupon made
known these words to the Princess of Daryabar, who was minded to
go straightway and acquaint the mother of Khudadad with everything
that had befallen her husband; but the surgeon, after full
reflection, said, “O Princess, shouldst thou fare with this intent,
haply ere thou arrive thither the forty-nine Princes may hear of
thy coming; and they, by some means or other, will assuredly
do thee die, and thy life will be spent to no purpose. Nay, rather
let me go first to Prince Khudadad’s mother: I will tell her all
thy tale and she doubtless will send for thee. Until such time
do thou remain secret in this Serai.” Accordingly the leech rode
on leisurely for the city and on the road he met a lady mounted
upon a she mule<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6475" id="noteref-6475" epub:type="noteref">6475</a> whose housings were of the richest and finest,
while behind her walked confidential servants, followed by a band
of horsemen and foot-soldiers and Habashi slaves; and, as she
rode along, the people formed espalier, standing on either side to
salute her while she passed. The leech also joined the throng and
made his obeisance, after which quoth he to a bystander, which was
a Darwaysh, “Methinks this lady must be a queen?” “’Tis even
so,” quoth the other, “she is the Consort of our Sultan and all
the folk honour and esteem her above her sister-wives for that
in truth she is the mother of Prince Khudadad and of him thou
surely hast heard.” Hereupon the surgeon accompanied the cavalcade;
and, when the lady dismounted at a cathedral-mosque and
gave alms of Ashrafis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6476" id="noteref-6476" epub:type="noteref">6476</a> and gold coins to all around (for the King
had enjoined her that until Khudadad’s return she should deal
charity to the poor with her own hand, and pray for the youth’s
being restored to his home in peace and safety), the mediciner
also mingled with the throng which joined in supplications for
their favourite and whispered to a slave saying, “O my brother,
it behoveth me that I make known without stay or delay to Queen
Firuzah a secret which is with me.” Replied he, “An it be
aught concerning Prince Khudadad ’tis well: the King’s wife
will surely give ear to thee; but an it be other, thou wilt hardly
win a hearing, for that she is distraught by the absence of her son
and careth not for aught beside.” The surgeon, still speaking
low, made reply, “My secret concerneth that which is on her
mind.” “If this be so,” returned the slave, “do thou follow her
train privily till it arrive at the palace gate.” Accordingly, when
the Lady Firuzah reached her royal apartments, the man made
petition to her, saying, “A stranger would fain tell somewhat to
thee in private;” and she deigned give permission and command,
exclaiming, “’Tis well, let him be brought hither.” Hereupon
the slave presented to her the surgeon whom the Queen with
gracious mien bade approach; and he, kissing ground between
her hands, made his petition in these words: “I have a long tale
to tell thy Highness whereat thou shalt greatly marvel.” Then
he described to her Khudadad’s condition, the villainy of his
brothers and his death at their hands and of his corpse having
been carried off by wild beasts. Queen Firuzah hearing of her
son’s murther fell straightway a-swooning to the ground, and the
attendants ran up and, raising her, besprinkled her face with rosewater
until she recovered sense and consciousness. Then she
gave orders to the surgeon, saying, “Hie thee straightway to the
Princess of Daryabar and convey to her greetings and expressions
of sympathy both from myself and from his sire;” and as the
leech departed she called to mind her son and wept with sore
weeping. By chance the Sultan, who was passing by that way,
seeing Firuzah in tears and sobs and breaking out into sore and
bitter lamentation, asked of her the reason thereof.——And as
the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and First Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that when
her husband enquired of Queen Firuzah why and wherefore she
wept and wailed, and moaned and groaned, she told him all she
had heard from the leech, and her husband was filled with hot wrath
against his sons. So he rose up and went straightway to the
audience-chamber, where the townsfolk had gathered together to
petition him and to pray for justice and redress; and they, seeing
his features working with rage, were all sore afraid. Presently
the Sultan seated himself on the throne of his kingship and gave
an order to his Grand Wazir, saying, “O Wazir Hasan, take with
thee a thousand men of the guard which keepeth watch and ward
over the palace and do thou bring hither the forty-and-nine Princes,
my unworthy sons, and cast them into the prison appointed unto
man-slayers and murtherers; and have a heed that none of them
escape.” The Wazir did as he was bidden, and seizing the Princes
one and all cast them into gaol with the murtherers and other
criminals, then reported his action to his liege lord. Hereat the
Sultan dismissed sundry claimants and suppliants, saying, “For
the space of one full-told month henceforth it besitteth me not to
sit in the justice-hall. Depart hence, and, when the thirty days
shall have passed away, do ye return hither again.” After this
rising from the throne he took with him the Wazir Hasan, and
entering the apartment of Queen Firuzah, gave command to the
Minister that he bring in all haste and with royal state and dignity
from the caravanserai, the Princess of Daryabar and the mediciner.
The Wazir straightway took horse accompanied by the Emirs and
soldiers; and, leading a fine white she-mule richly adorned with
jewelled trappings from out of the royal stables, he rode to the
caravanserai wherein abode the Princess of Daryabar. Having
told her all that the King had done, he seated her upon the animal
and, mounting the surgeon upon a steed of Turcoman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6477" id="noteref-6477" epub:type="noteref">6477</a> blood, all
three proceeded with pomp and grandeur to the palace. The
shop-keepers and townsfolk ran out to greet the lady as the calvacade
wound its way through the streets; and, when they heard
say that she was the wife of Prince Khudadad, they rejoiced with
exceeding joy for that they should now receive tidings of his
whereabouts. As soon as the procession reached the palace gates
the Princess of Daryabar saw the Sultan, who had come forth to
greet her, and she alighted from the mule and kissed his feet. The
King then raised her by the hand and conducted her to the
chamber wherein sat Queen Firuzah awaiting her visit, and all
three fell on one another’s necks and wept sore and could on no
wise control their grief. But whenas their sorrow was somewhat
assuaged, the Princess of Daryabar said to the King, “O my lord
the Sultan, I would proffer humble petition that full vengeance
may fall upon those, one and all, by whom my husband hath been
so foully and cruelly murthered.” Replied the King, “O my lady,
rest assured that I will assuredly put to death all those villains in
requital for the blood of Khudadad;” presently adding, “’Tis true
that the dead body of my brave son hath not been found, still it
seemeth but right to me that a tomb be built, a cenotaph whereby
his greatness and goodness may be held in everlasting remembrance.”
Thereupon he summoned the Grand Wazir and bade
that a great Mausoleum of white marble be edified amiddlemost
the city and the Minister straightway appointed workmen and
made choice of a suitable spot in the very centre of the capital. So
there they built a gorgeous cenotaph crowned with a noble dome
under which was sculptured a figure of Khudadad; and, when the
news of its completion reached the King, he appointed a day for
ceremonious mourning and perlections of the Koran. At the appointed
time and term the townsfolk gathered together to see the
funeral procession and the obsequies for the departed; and the
Sultan went in state to the Mausoleum together with all the Wazirs,
the Emirs and Lords of the land, and took seat upon carpets of
black satin purfled with flowers of gold which were dispread over
the marble floor. After a while a bevy of Knights rode up, with
downcast heads and half-closed eyes; and twice circuiting the dome<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6478" id="noteref-6478" epub:type="noteref">6478</a>
they halted the third time in front of the door, and cried out aloud,
“O Prince, O son of our Sultan, could we by the sway of our good
swords and the strength of our gallant arms restore thee to life,
nor heart nor force would fail us in the endeavour; but before the
fiat of Almighty Allah all must bow the neck.” Then the horsemen
rode away to the place whence they came, followed by one
hundred hermits hoar of head and dwellers of the caves who had
passed their lives in solitude and abstinence nor ever held converse
with man or womankind, neither did they appear in Harran
at any time save for the obsequies of the reigning race. In front
came one of these greybeards steadying with one hand a huge and
ponderous tome which he bore upon his head. Presently all the
holy men thrice compassed the Mausoleum, then standing on the
highway the eldest cried with a loud voice, “O Prince, could we by
dint of orisons and devotions bring thee back to life, these hearts
and souls of ours would be devoted to quickening thee, and on
seeing thee arise once again we would wipe thy feet with our own
age-white beards.” And when they also retired came one hundred
maidens of wondrous beauty and loveliness, mounted on white
barbs whose saddles were richly embroidered and set with jewels:
their faces were bare and on their heads they bore golden canisters
filled with precious stones, rubies and diamonds. They also rode
in circuit round the cenotaph and, halting at the door, the youngest
and fairest of them, speaking in the name of her sisterhood, exclaimed,
“O Prince, could our youth and our charms avail thee
aught, we would present ourselves to thee and become thy handmaids;
but alas! thou knowest full well that our beauties are here
all in vain nor can our love now warm thy clay.” Then they also
departed in the deepest grief. As soon as they had disappeared
the Sultan and all with him rose up and walked thrice round the
figure that had been set up under the dome; then standing at its
feet the father said, “O my beloved son, enlighten these eyes
which tears for the stress of separation have thus bedimmed.” He
then wept bitterly and all his Ministers and Courtiers and Grandees
joined in his mourning and lamentations; and, when they had
made an end of the obsequies, the Sultan and his suite returned
palace-wards and the door of the dome was locked.——And as the
morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Sultan commanded congregational prayers in all the mosques for a
full told week and he ceased not to mourn and weep and wail before
the cenotaph of his son for eight days. And as soon as this term
was passed he commanded the Grand Wazir that vengeance be
meted out for the murther of Prince Khudadad, and that the
Princes be brought out from their dungeons and be done to death.
The tidings were bruited about the city, and preparations were
made for executing the assassins and crowds of folk collected to
gaze upon the scaffold, when suddenly came a report that an enemy
whom the King had routed in bygone times was marching upon
the city with a conquering army. Hereat the Sultan was sore
troubled and perplexed and the ministers of state said one to other,
“Alas! had Prince Khudadad been on life he would forthwith
have put to flight the forces of the foe however fierce and fell.”
Natheless the Sovran set out from the city with his suite and host,
and eke he made ready for flight to some other land by way of the
river should the enemy’s force prove victorious. Then the two
powers met in deadly combat; and the invader, surrounding the
King of Harran’s many on every side, would have cut him to
pieces with all his warriors, when behold, an armed force hitherto
unseen rode athwart the plain at a pace so swift and so sure that the
two hostile Kings gazed upon them in uttermost amazement, nor
wist any one whence that host came. But when it drew near, the
horsemen charged home on the enemies and in the twinkling of
an eye put them to flight; then hotly pursuing felled them with
the biting sword and the piercing spear. Seeing this onslaught
the King of Harran marvelled greatly and rendering thanks to
heaven said to those around him, “Learn ye the name of the
Captain of yonder host, who he may be and whence came he.”
But when all the foemen had fallen upon the field save only a few
who escaped hither and thither and the hostile sultan who had been
taken prisoner, the Captain of the friendly forces returned from
pursuit well pleased to greet the King. And, lo and behold! as the
twain drew near one to other the Sultan was certified that the Captain
was none other than his beloved child, Khudadad, whilome lost and
now found. Accordingly, he rejoiced with joy unspeakable that
his enemy had thus been vanquished and that he had again looked
upon his son, Khudadad, who stood before him alive and safe and
sound. “O my sire,” presently exclaimed the Prince, “I am he
whom thou deemest to have been slain; but Allah Almighty hath
kept me on life that I might this day stand thee in good stead
and destroy these thine enemies.” “O my beloved son,” replied
the King, “surely I had despaired and never hoped again to see
thee with these mine eyes.” So father and son dismounted and
fell upon each other’s necks and quoth the Sultan, clasping the
youth’s hand, “Long since have I known of thy valiant deeds, and
how thou didst save thine ill-omened brothers from the hands of
the man-devouring Abyssinian, and of the evil wherewith they
requited thee. Go now to thy mother, of whom naught remaineth,
through bitter tears for thee, save skin and bone: be thou the
first to gladden her heart and give her the good tidings of this
thy victory.” As they rode along, the Prince enquired of the
Sultan, his sire, how he had heard tell of the Habashi and of the
rescue of the Princes from the cannibal’s clutches. “Hath one of my
brothers,” added he, “informed thee of this adventure?” “Not so,
O my son,” replied the King, “not they, but the Princess of
Daryabar told me the miserable tale thereof: she hath dwelt for
many days with me and ’twas she who first and foremost demanded
vengeance for thy blood.” When Khudadad heard that the
Princess his spouse was his father’s guest, he rejoiced with exceeding
joy and cried, “Suffer me first to see my mother;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6479" id="noteref-6479" epub:type="noteref">6479</a> then will I
go to the Princess of Daryabar.” The King of Harran hereat
struck off the head of his chief enemy and exposed it publicly
throughout the streets of his capital, and all the people exulted
mightily not only at the victory but also for the return of
Khudadad safe and sound; and dancing and feasting were in
every household. Presently Queen Firuzah and the Princess of
Daryabar presented themselves before the Sultan and offered
their congratulations to him, then they went to see Khudadad both
hand in hand and the three falling on one another’s necks wept for
very joy.——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that after this
the King and his Queen and daughter-in-law sat long conversing,
and they marvelled much how Khudadad, albeit he was sorely gashed
and pierced with the sword, had escaped alive from that wildest of
wolds, whereupon the Prince at the bidding of his sire told his tale
in these words: “A peasant mounted on a camel chanced to pass
by my pavilion and seeing me sore wounded and weltering in my
blood, set me upon his beast and conveyed me to his house; then,
choosing some roots of desert-herbs he placed them on the hurts so
that they kindly healed, and I speedily recovered strength. After
returning thanks to my benefactor and giving him liberal largesse,
I set out for the city of Harran and on the road I saw the forces of
the foe in countless numbers marching upon thy city. Wherefore
I made the matter known to the folk of the townships and villages
round about and besought their aid; then collecting a large force I
placed myself at the head thereof, and arriving in the nick of time
destroyed the invading hosts.” Hereupon the Sultan gave thanks
to Allah Almighty and said, “Let all the Princes who conspired
against thy life be put to death;” and sent forthright for the
Sworder of his vengeance; but Khudadad made request to his sire
and said, “In good sooth, O my lord the King, they all deserve
the doom thou hast ordained, yet be not these my brethren and
eke thine own flesh and blood? I have freely forgiven them their
offence against me and I humbly pray thy pardon also, that thou
grant them their lives, for that blood ever calleth unto blood.”
The Sultan at length consented and forgave their offence. Then,
summoning all the Ministers, he declared Khudadad his heir and
successor, in presence of the Princes whom he bade bring from
the prison house. Khudadad caused their chains and fetters to
be stricken off and embraced them one by one, showing them the
same fondness and affection as he had shown to them in the
castle of the cannibal Habashi. All the folk on hearing of this
noble conduct of Prince Khudadad raised shouts of applause and
loved him yet more than before. The surgeon who had done such
good service to the Princess of Daryabar received a robe of honour
and much wealth; and on this wise that which began with mishap
had issue in all happiness. When Queen Shahrazad ended this
story she said to Shahryar, “O my lord, thou art doubtless
astonished to find that the Caliph Harún al-Rashid changed his
wrath against Ghánim<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6480" id="noteref-6480" epub:type="noteref">6480</a> and his mother and sister to feelings of
favour and affection, but I am assured that thou wilt be the
more surprised on hearing the story of the curious adventures
of that same Caliph with the blind man, Bábá Abdullah.” Quoth
Dunyazad, as was her way, to her sister Shahrazad, “O sister mine,
what a rare and delectable tale hast thou told and now prithee
favour us with another.” She replied, “It is well nigh dawn but,
if my life be spared, I will tell thee as the morrow morrows a
strange and wonderful history of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6481" id="noteref-6481" epub:type="noteref">6481</a>——And
