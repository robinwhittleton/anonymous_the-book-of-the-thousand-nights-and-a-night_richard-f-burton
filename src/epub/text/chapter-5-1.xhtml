<h2 epub:type="title">The Ebony Horse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2074" id="noteref-2074" epub:type="noteref">2074</a></h2>

<p>There was once in times of yore and ages long gone before, a
great and puissant King, of the Kings of the Persians, Sábúr by
name, who was the richest of all the Kings in store of wealth and
dominion and surpassed each and every in wit and wisdom. He
was generous, open handed and beneficent, and he gave to those
who sought him and repelled not those who resorted to him; and
he comforted the broken-hearted and honourably entreated those
who fled to him for refuge. Moreover, he loved the poor and was
hospitable to strangers and did the oppressed justice upon the
oppressor. He had three daughters, like full moons of shining
light or flower-gardens blooming bright; and a son as he were the
moon; and it was his wont to keep two festivals in the twelvemonth,
those of the Nau-Roz, or New Year, and Mihrgán the Autumnal
Equinox,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2075" id="noteref-2075" epub:type="noteref">2075</a> on which occasions he threw open his palaces and gave
largesse and made proclamation of safety and security and promoted
his chamberlains and viceroys; and the people of his realm
came in to him and saluted him and gave him joy of the holy
day, bringing him gifts and servants and eunuchs. Now he loved
science and geometry, and one festival-day as he sat on his kingly
throne there came in to him three wise men, cunning artificers
and past masters in all manner of craft and inventions, skilled in
making things curious and rare, such as confound the wit; and
versed in the knowledge of occult truths and perfect in mysteries
and subtleties. And they were of three different tongues and
countries, the first a Hindi or Indian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2076" id="noteref-2076" epub:type="noteref">2076</a> the second a Roumi or
Greek and the third a Farsi or Persian. The Indian came
forwards and, prostrating himself before the King, wished him joy
of the festival and laid before him a present befitting his dignity;
that is to say, a man of gold, set with precious gems and jewels
of price and hending in hand a golden trumpet. When Sabur<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2077" id="noteref-2077" epub:type="noteref">2077</a>
saw this, he asked, “O sage, what is the virtue of this figure?”;
and the Indian answered, “O my lord, if this figure be set at
the gate of thy city, it will be a guardian over it; for, if an
enemy enter the place, it will blow this clarion against him
and he will be seized with a palsy and drop down dead.” Much
the King marvelled at this and cried, “By Allah, O sage, an this
thy word be true, I will grant thee thy wish and thy desire.”
Then came forward the Greek and, prostrating himself before the
King, presented him with a basin of silver, in whose midst was
a peacock of gold, surrounded by four-and-twenty chicks of the
same metal. Sabur looked at them and turning to the Greek,
said to him, “O sage, what is the virtue of this peacock?” “O
my lord,” answered he, “as often as an hour of the day or night
passeth, it pecketh one of its young and crieth out and flappeth
its wings, till the four-and-twenty hours are accomplished;
and when the month cometh to an end, it will open its mouth
and thou shalt see the crescent therein.” And the King said,
“An thou speak sooth, I will bring thee to thy wish and thy
desire.” Then came forward the Persian sage and, prostrating
himself before the King, presented him with a horse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2078" id="noteref-2078" epub:type="noteref">2078</a> of the
blackest ebony-wood inlaid with gold and jewels, and ready
harnessed with saddle, bridle and stirrups such as befit Kings;
which when Sabur saw, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and
was confounded at the beauty of its form and the ingenuity of its
fashion. So he asked, “What is the use of this horse of wood, and
what is its virtue and what the secret of its movement?”; and the
Persian answered, “O my lord, the virtue of this horse is that, if
one mount him, it will carry him whither he will and fare with its
rider through the air and cover the space of a year in a single
day.” The King marvelled and was amazed at these three
wonders, following thus hard upon one another on the same day,
and turning to the sage, said to him, “By Allah the Omnipotent,
and our Lord the Beneficent, who created all creatures and feedeth
them with meat and drink, an thy speech be veritable and the
virtue of thy contrivance appear, I will assuredly give thee whatsoever
thou lustest for and will bring thee to thy desire and thy
wish!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2079" id="noteref-2079" epub:type="noteref">2079</a> Then he entertained the sages three days, that he might
make trial of their gifts; after which they brought the figures
before him and each took the creature he had wroughten and
showed him the mystery of its movement. The trumpeter blew the
trump; the peacock pecked its chicks and the Persian sage mounted
the ebony horse, whereupon it soared with him high in air and
descended again. When King Sabur saw all this, he was amazed
and perplexed and felt like to fly for joy and said to the three
sages, “Now I am certified of the truth of your words and it
behoveth me to quit me of my promise. Ask ye, therefore, what
ye will, and I will give you that same.” Now the report of the
King’s daughters had reached the sages, so they answered, “If the
King be content with us and accept of our gifts and allow us to
prefer a request to him, we crave of him that he give us his three
daughters in marriage, that we may be his sons-in-law; for that the
stability of Kings may not be gainsaid.” Quoth the King, “I grant
you that which you wish and you desire,” and bade summon the
Kazi forthright, that he might marry each of the sages to one of
his daughters. Now it fortuned that the Princesses were behind
a curtain, looking on; and when they heard this, the youngest
considered her husband to be and behold, he was an old man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2080" id="noteref-2080" epub:type="noteref">2080</a> an
hundred years of age, with hair frosted, forehead drooping, eyebrows
mangy, ears slitten, beard and mustachios stained and
dyed; eyes red and goggle; cheeks bleached and hollow; flabby
nose like a brinjall, or egg-plant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2081" id="noteref-2081" epub:type="noteref">2081</a>; face like a cobbler’s apron, teeth
overlapping and lips like camel’s kidneys, loose and pendulous; in
brief a terror, a horror, a monster, for he was of the folk of his time
the unsightliest and of his age the fright-fullest; sundry of his
grinders had been knocked out and his eye-teeth were like the
tusks of the Jinni who frighteneth poultry in hen-houses. Now
the girl was the fairest and most graceful of her time, more elegant
than the gazelle however tender, than the gentlest zephyr blander
and brighter than the moon at her full; for amorous fray right
suitable; confounding in graceful sway the waving bough and
outdoing in swimming gait the pacing roe; in fine she was fairer
and sweeter by far than all her sisters. So, when she saw her
suitor, she went to her chamber and strewed dust on her head and
tore her clothes and fell to buffeting her face and weeping and
wailing. Now the Prince, her brother, Kamar al-Akmár, or the
Moon of Moons hight, was then newly returned from a journey
and, hearing her weeping and crying came in to her (for he loved
her with fond affection, more than his other sisters) and asked her,
“What aileth thee? What hath befallen thee? Tell me and
conceal naught from me.” So she smote her breast and answered,
“O my brother and my dear one, I have nothing to hide. If the
palace be straitened upon thy father, I will go out; and if he be
resolved upon a foul thing, I will separate myself from him, though
he consent not to make provision for me; and my Lord will
provide.” Quoth he, “Tell me what meaneth this talk and what
hath straitened thy breast and troubled thy temper.” “O my
brother and my dear one,” answered the Princess, “Know that my
father hath promised me in marriage to a wicked magician who
brought him, as a gift, a horse of black wood, and hath bewitched
him with his craft and his egromancy; but, as for me, I will none
of him, and would, because of him, I had never come into this
world!” Her brother soothed her and solaced her, then fared to
his sire and said, “What be this wizard to whom thou hast given
my youngest sister in marriage, and what is this present which he
hath brought thee, so that thou hast killed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2082" id="noteref-2082" epub:type="noteref">2082</a> my sister with chagrin?
It is not right that this should be.” Now the Persian was standing
by and, when he heard the Prince’s words, he was mortified and
filled with fury and the King said, “O my son, an thou sawest
this horse, thy wit would be confounded and thou wouldst be
amated with amazement.” Then he bade the slaves bring the
horse before him and they did so; and, when the Prince saw it, it
pleased him. So (being an accomplished cavalier) he mounted it
forthright and struck its sides with the shovel-shaped stirrup-irons;
but it stirred not and the King said to the Sage, “Go show him its
movement, that he also may help thee to win thy wish.” Now
the Persian bore the Prince a grudge because he willed not he
should have his sister; so he showed him the pin of ascent on
the right side of the horse and saying to him, “Trill this,” left
him. Thereupon the Prince trilled the pin and lo! the horse
forthwith soared with him high in ether, as it were a bird, and
gave not overflying till it disappeared from men’s espying, whereat
the King was troubled and perplexed about his case and said to
the Persian, “O sage, look how thou mayst make him descend.”
But he replied, “O my lord, I can do nothing, and thou wilt
never see him again till Resurrection-day, for he, of his ignorance
and pride, asked me not of the pin of descent and I forgot
to acquaint him therewith.” When the King heard this, he was
enraged with sore rage; and bade bastinado the sorcerer and clap
him in jail, whilst he himself cast the crown from his head and beat
his face and smote his breast. Moreover, he shut the doors of
his palaces and gave himself up to weeping and keening, he and
his wife and daughters and all the folk of the city; and thus their
joy was turned to annoy and their gladness changed into sore
affliction and sadness. Thus far concerning them; but as regards
the Prince, the horse gave not over soaring with him till he drew
near the sun, whereat he gave himself up for lost and saw death
in the skies, and was confounded at his case, repenting him of
having mounted the horse and saying to himself, “Verily, this was
a device of the Sage to destroy me on account of my youngest
sister; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I am lost without recourse; but I
wonder, did not he who made the ascent-pin make also a descent-pin?”
Now he was a man of wit and knowledge and intelligence;
so he fell to feeling all the parts of the horse, but saw
nothing save a screw, like a cock’s head, on its right shoulder and
the like on the left, when quoth he to himself, “I see no sign save
these things like buttons.” Presently he turned the right-hand
pin, whereupon the horse flew heavenwards with increased speed.
So he left it and looking at the sinister shoulder and finding
another pin, he wound it up and immediately the steed’s upwards
motion slowed and ceased and it began to descend, little by little,
towards the face of the earth, while the rider became yet more
cautious and careful of his life.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince wound up the sinister screw, the steed’s upward motion
slowed and ceased, and it began to descend, little by little,
towards the earth while the rider became yet more cautious and
careful of his life. And when he saw this and knew the uses of
the horse, his heart was filled with joy and gladness and he thanked
Almighty Allah for that He had deigned deliver him from destruction.
Then he began to turn the horse’s head whithersoever
he would, making it rise and fall at pleasure, till he had gotten
complete mastery over its every movement. He ceased not to
descend the whole of that day, for that the steed’s ascending flight
had borne him afar from the earth; and, as he descended, he
diverted himself with viewing the various cities and countries over
which he passed and which he knew not, never having seen them
in his life. Amongst the rest, he descried a city ordered after the
fairest fashion in the midst of a verdant and riant land, rich in
trees and streams, with gazelles pacing daintily over the plains;
whereat he fell a-musing and said to himself, “Would I knew the
name of yon town and in what land it is!” And he took to
circling about it and observing it right and left. By this time, the
day began to decline and the sun drew near to its downing; and
he said in his mind, “Verily I find no goodlier place to night in
than this city; so I will lodge here and early on the morrow I will
return to my kith and kin and my kingdom; and tell my father
and family what hath passed and acquaint him with what mine
eyes have seen.” Then he addressed himself to seeking a place
wherein he might safely bestow himself and his horse and where
none should descry him, and presently behold, he espied a-middle-most
of the city a palace rising high in upper air surrounded by a
great wall with lofty crenelles and battlements, guarded by forty
black slaves, clad in complete mail and armed with spears and
swords, bows and arrows. Quoth he, “This is a goodly place,”
and turned the descent-pin, whereupon the horse sank down
with him like a weary bird, and alighted gently on the terrace-roof
of the palace. So the Prince dismounted and ejaculating
“Alhamdolillah”—praise be to Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2083" id="noteref-2083" epub:type="noteref">2083</a>—he began to go round
about the horse and examine it, saying, “By Allah, he who
fashioned thee with these perfections was a cunning craftsman,
and if the Almighty extend the term of my life and restore me
to my country and kinsfolk in safety and reunite me with my
father, I will assuredly bestow upon him all manner bounties and
benefit him with the utmost beneficence.” By this time night had
overtaken him and he sat on the roof till he was assured that all
in the palace slept; and indeed hunger and thirst were sore upon
him, for that he had not tasted food nor drunk water since he
parted from his sire. So he said within himself, “Surely the like of
this palace will not lack of victual;” and, leaving the horse above,
went down in search of somewhat to eat. Presently, he came to
a staircase and descending it to the bottom, found himself in a
court paved with white marble and alabaster, which shone in the
light of the moon. He marvelled at the place and the goodliness
of its fashion, but sensed no sound of speaker and saw no living
soul and stood in perplexed surprise, looking right and left and
knowing not whither he should wend. Then said he to himself,
“I may not do better than return to where I left my horse and
pass the night by it; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount
and ride away.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
king’s son to himself, “I may not do better than pass the night
by my horse; and as soon as day shall dawn I will mount and
ride away.” However, as he tarried talking to himself, he espied
a light within the palace, and making towards it, found that it
came from a candle that stood before a door of the Harim, at the
head of a sleeping eunuch, as he were one of the Ifrits of Solomon
or a tribesman of the Jinn, longer than lumber and broader than
a bench. He lay before the door, with the pommel of his sword
gleaming in the flame of the candle, and at his head was a bag
of leather<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2084" id="noteref-2084" epub:type="noteref">2084</a> hanging from a column of granite. When the Prince
saw this, he was affrighted and said, “I crave help from Allah the
Supreme! O mine Holy One, even as Thou hast already delivered
me from destruction, so vouchsafe me strength to quit
myself of the adventure of this palace!” So saying, he put out
his hand to the budget and taking it, carried it aside and opened
it and found in it food of the best. He ate his fill and refreshed
himself and drank water, after which he hung up the provision-bag
in its place and drawing the eunuch’s sword from its sheath,
took it, whilst the slave slept on, knowing not whence destiny
should come to him. Then the Prince fared forwards into the
palace and ceased not till he came to a second door, with a curtain
drawn before it; so he raised the curtain and behold, on entering
he saw a couch of the whitest ivory, inlaid with pearls and jacinths
and jewels, and four slave-girls sleeping about it. He went up to
the couch, to see what was thereon, and found a young lady lying
asleep, chemised with her hair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2085" id="noteref-2085" epub:type="noteref">2085</a> as she were the full moon rising<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2086" id="noteref-2086" epub:type="noteref">2086</a>
over the Eastern horizon, with flower-white brow and shining hair-parting
and cheeks like blood-red anemones and dainty moles
thereon. He was amazed at her as she lay in her beauty and
loveliness, her symmetry and grace, and he recked no more
of death. So he went up to her, trembling in every nerve and,
shuddering with pleasure, kissed her on the right cheek; whereupon
she awoke forthright and opened her eyes, and seeing the
Prince standing at her head, said to him, “Who art thou and
whence comest thou?” Quoth he, “I am thy slave and thy
lover.” Asked she, “And who brought thee hither?” and he
answered, “My Lord and my fortune.” Then said Shams
al-Nahár<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2087" id="noteref-2087" epub:type="noteref">2087</a> (for such was her name), “Haply thou art he who
demanded me yesterday of my father in marriage and he rejected
thee, pretending that thou wast foul of favour. By Allah, my sire
lied in his throat when he spoke this thing, for thou art not other
than beautiful.” Now the son of the King of Hind had sought
her in marriage, but her father had rejected him, for that he was
ugly and uncouth, and she thought the Prince was he. So, when
she saw his beauty and grace (for indeed he was like the radiant
moon) the syntheism<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2088" id="noteref-2088" epub:type="noteref">2088</a> of love gat hold of her heart as it were a
flaming fire, and they fell to talk and converse. Suddenly, her
waiting-women awoke and, seeing the Prince with their mistress,
said to her, “Oh my lady, who is this with thee?” Quoth she,
“I know not; I found him sitting by me, when I woke up: haply
‘tis he who seeketh me in marriage of my sire.” Quoth they,
“O my lady, by Allah the All-Father, this is not he who seeketh
thee in marriage, for he is hideous and this man is handsome
and of high degree. Indeed, the other is not fit to be his servant.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2089" id="noteref-2089" epub:type="noteref">2089</a>
Then the handmaidens went out to the eunuch, and finding him
slumbering awoke him, and he started up in alarm. Said they, “How
happeneth it that thou art on guard at the palace and yet men come
in to us, whilst we are asleep?” When the black heard this, he
sprang in haste to his sword, but found it not; and fear took him
and trembling. Then he went in, confounded, to his mistress and
seeing the Prince sitting at talk with her, said to him, “O my lord,
art thou man or Jinni?” Replied the Prince, “Woe to thee, O
unluckiest of slaves: how darest thou even the sons of the royal
Chosroes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2090" id="noteref-2090" epub:type="noteref">2090</a> with one of the unbelieving Satans?” And he was as
a raging lion. Then he took the sword in his hand and said to the
slave, “I am the King’s son-in-law, and he hath married me to his
daughter and bidden me go in to her.” And when the eunuch
heard these words he replied, “O my lord, if thou be indeed of kind
a man as thou avouchest, she is fit for none but for thee, and thou
art worthier of her than any other.” Thereupon the eunuch ran
to the King, shrieking loud and rending his raiment and heaving
dust upon his head; and when the King heard his outcry, he said
to him, “What hath befallen thee?: speak quickly and be brief;
for thou hast fluttered my heart.” Answered the eunuch, “O King,
come to thy daughter’s succour; for a devil of the Jinn, in the likeness
of a King’s son, hath got possession of her; so up and at
him!” When the King heard this, he thought to kill him and said,
“How camest thou to be careless of my daughter and let this
demon come at her?” Then he betook himself to the Princess’s
palace, where he found her slave-women standing to await him and
asked them, “What is come to my daughter?” “O King,”
answered they, “slumber overcame us and, when we awoke, we
found a young man sitting upon her couch in talk with her, as he
were the full moon; never saw we aught fairer of favour than he.
So we questioned him of his case and he declared that thou hadst
given him thy daughter in marriage. More than this we know not,
nor do we know if he be a man or a Jinni; but he is modest and
well bred, and doth nothing unseemly or which leadeth to disgrace.”
Now when the King heard these words, his wrath cooled
and he raised the curtain little by little and looking in, saw sitting
at talk with his daughter a Prince of the goodliest with a face like
the full moon for sheen. At this sight he could not contain himself,
of his jealousy for his daughter’s honour; and, putting aside
the curtain, rushed in upon them drawn sword in hand like a
furious Ghul. Now when the Prince saw him he asked the
Princess, “Is this thy sire?”; and she answered, “Yes.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixtieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince saw the King rushing in upon them, drawn sword in hand,
like a furious Ghul he asked the Princess, “Is this thy sire?”;
and she answered, “Yes.” Whereupon he sprang to his feet and,
seizing his sword, cried out at the King with so terrible a cry that
he was confounded. Then the youth would have fallen on him
with the sword; but the King seeing that the Prince was doughtier
than he, sheathed his scymitar and stood till the young man came
up to him, when he accosted him courteously and said to him, “O
youth, art thou a man or a Jinni?” Quoth the Prince, “Did I not
respect thy right as mine host and thy daughter’s honour, I would
spill thy blood! How darest thou fellow me with devils, me that
am a Prince of the sons of the royal Chosroes who, had they
wished to take thy kingdom, could shake thee like an earthquake
from thy glory and thy dominions and spoil thee of all thy possessions?”
Now when the King heard his words, he was confounded
with awe and bodily fear of him and rejoined, “If thou indeed be
of the sons of the Kings, as thou pretendest, how cometh it that
thou enterest my palace without my permission, and smirchest
mine honour, making thy way to my daughter and feigning that
thou art her husband and claiming that I have given her to thee
to wife, I that have slain Kings and King’s sons, who sought her
of me in marriage? And now who shall save thee from my might
and majesty when, if I cried out to my slaves and servants and
bade them put thee to the vilest of deaths they would slay thee
forthright? Who shall deliver thee out of my hand?” When
the Prince heard this speech of the King he answered, “Verily, I
wonder at thee and at the shortness and denseness of thy wit!
Say me, canst covet for thy daughter a mate comelier than myself,
and hast ever seen a stouter hearted man or one better fitted for
a Sultan or a more glorious in rank and dominion than I?”
Rejoined the King, “Nay, by Allah! but I would have had thee,
O youth, act after the custom of Kings and demand her from me
to wife before witnesses, that I might have married her to thee
publicly; and now, even were I to marry her to thee privily, yet
hast thou dishonoured me in her person.” Rejoined the Prince,
“Thou sayest sooth, O King, but if thou summon thy slaves and
thy soldiers and they fall upon me and slay me, as thou pretendest,
thou wouldst but publish thine own disgrace, and the folk would
be divided between belief in thee and disbelief in thee. Wherefore,
O King, thou wilt do well, meseemeth, to turn from this thought
to that which I shall counsel thee.” Quoth the King, “Let me
hear what thou hast to advise;” and quoth the Prince, “What I
have to propose to thee is this: either do thou meet me in combat
singular, I and thou; and he who slayeth his adversary shall be
held the worthier and having a better title to the kingdom; or
else, let me be this night and, whenas dawns the morn, draw out
against me thy horsemen and footmen and servants; but first tell
me their number.” Said the King, “They are forty thousand
horse, besides my own slaves and their followers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2091" id="noteref-2091" epub:type="noteref">2091</a> who are the like
of them in number.” Thereupon said the Prince, “When the day
shall break, do thou array them against me and say to them”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth
the Prince, “When day shall break, do thou array them against me
and say to them:—This man is a suitor to me for my daughter’s
hand, on condition that he shall do battle single-handed against
you all; for he pretendeth that he will overcome you and put you
to the rout, and indeed that ye cannot prevail against him. After
which, leave me to do battle with them: if they slay me, then is thy
secret the surer guarded and thine honour the better warded; and
if I overcome them and see their backs, then is it the like of me a
King should covet to his son-in-law.” So the King approved of
his opinion and accepted his proposition, despite his awe at the
boldness of his speech and amaze at the pretensions of the Prince
to meet in fight his whole host, such as he had described it to him,
being at heart assured that he would perish in the fray and so he
should be quit of him and freed from the fear of dishonour. Thereupon
he called the eunuch and bade him go to his Wazir without
stay and delay and command him to assemble the whole of the
army and cause them don their arms and armour and mount their
steeds. So the eunuch carried the King’s order to the Minister,
who straightway summoned the Captains of the host and the
Lords of the realm and bade them don their harness of derring-do
and mount horse and sally forth in battle array. Such was their
case; but as regards the King, he sat a long while conversing with
the young Prince, being pleased with his wise speech and good
sense and fine breeding. And when it was daybreak he returned
to his palace and, seating himself on his throne, commanded his
merry men to mount and bade them saddle one of the best of the
royal steeds with handsome selle and housings and trappings and
bring it to the Prince. But the youth said, “O King, I will not
mount horse, till I come in view of the troops and review them.”
“Be it as thou wilt,” replied the King. Then the two repaired to
the parade-ground, where the troops were drawn up, and the young
Prince looked upon them and noted their great number; after
which the King cried out to them, saying, “Ho, all ye men, there
is come to me a youth who seeketh my daughter in marriage; and
in very sooth never have I seen a goodlier than he; no, nor a
stouter of heart nor a doughtier of arm, for he pretendeth that he
can overcome you, single-handed, and force you to flight and that,
were ye an hundred thousand in number, yet for him would ye be
but few. Now when he chargeth down on you, do ye receive him
upon point of pike and sharp of sabre; for, indeed, he hath undertaken
a mighty matter.” Then quoth the King to the Prince,
“Up, O my son, and do thy devoir on them.” Answered he, “O
King, thou dealest not justly and fairly by me: how shall I go
forth against them, seeing that I am afoot and the men be
mounted?” The King retorted, “I bade thee mount, and thou
refusedst; but choose thou which of my horses thou wilt.” Then
he said, “Not one of thy horses pleaseth me, and I will ride none
but that on which I came.” Asked the King, “And where is thy
horse?” “Atop of thy palace.” “In what part of my palace?”
“On the roof.” Now when the King heard these words, he cried,
“Out on thee! this is the first sign thou hast given of madness.
How can the horse be on the roof? But we shall at once see if
thou speak truth or lies.” Then he turned to one of his chief
officers and said to him, “Go to my palace and bring me what
thou findest on the roof.” So all the people marvelled at the
young Prince’s words, saying one to other, “How can a horse
come down the steps from the roof? Verily this is a thing whose
like we never heard.” In the mean time the King’s messenger
repaired to the palace and mounting to the roof, found the horse
standing there and never had he looked on a handsomer; but
when he drew near and examined it, he saw that it was made of
ebony and ivory. Now the officer was accompanied by other high
officers, who also looked on and they laughed to one another,
saying, “Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake?
We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see
the truth of his case.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
high officials looked upon the horse, they laughed one to other
and said, “Was it of the like of this horse that the youth spake?
We cannot deem him other than mad; however, we shall soon see
the truth of his case. Peradventure herein is some mighty matter,
and he is a man of high degree.” Then they lifted up the horse
bodily and, carrying it to the King, set it down before him, and
all the lieges flocked round to look at it, marvelling at the beauty
of its proportions and the richness of its saddle and bridle. The
King also admired it and wondered at it with extreme wonder;
and he asked the Prince, “O youth, is this thy horse?” He
answered, “Yes, O King, this is my horse, and thou shalt soon see
the marvel it showeth.” Rejoined the King, “Then take and
mount it,” and the Prince retorted, “I will not mount till the
troops withdraw afar from it.” So the King bade them retire a
bowshot from the horse; whereupon quoth its owner, “O King,
see thou; I am about to mount my horse and charge upon thy
host and scatter them right and left and split their hearts asunder.”
Said the King, “Do as thou wilt; and spare not their lives, for
they will not spare thine.” Then the Prince mounted, whilst the
troops ranged themselves in ranks before him, and one said to
another, “When the youth cometh between the ranks, we will take
him on the points of our pikes and the sharps of our sabres.”
Quoth another, “By Allah, this is a mere misfortune: how shall
we slay a youth so comely of face and shapely of form?” And a
third continued, “Ye will have hard work to get the better of him;
for the youth had not done this, but for what he knew of his own
prowess and pre-eminence of valour.” Meanwhile, having settled
himself in his saddle, the Prince turned the pin of ascent; whilst
all eyes were strained to see what he would do, whereupon the
horse began to heave and rock and sway to and fro and make the
strangest of movements steed ever made, till its belly was filled
with air and it took flight with its rider and soared high into the
sky. When the King saw this, he cried out to his men, saying,
“Woe to you! catch him, catch him, ere he ‘scape you!” But his
Wazirs and Viceroys said to him, “O King, can a man overtake
the flying bird? This is surely none but some mighty magician
or Mar¡d of the Jinn or devil, and Allah save thee from him. So
praise thou the Almighty for deliverance of thee and of all thy
host from his hand.” Then the King returned to his palace
after seeing the feat of the Prince and, going in to his daughter,
acquainted her with what had befallen them both on the parade-ground.
He found her grievously afflicted for the Prince and
bewailing her separation from him; wherefore she fell sick with
violent sickness and took to her pillow. Now when her father
saw her on this wise, he pressed her to his breast and kissing her
between the eyes, said to her, “O my daughter, praise Allah
Almighty and thank Him for that He hath delivered us from this
crafty enchanter, this villain, this low fellow, this thief who thought
only of seducing thee!” And he repeated to her the story of the
Prince and how he had disappeared in the firmament; and he
abused him and cursed him knowing not how dearly his daughter
loved him. But she paid no heed to his words and did but redouble
in her tears and wails, saying to herself, “By Allah, I will
neither eat meat nor drain drink, till Allah reunite me with him!”
Her father was greatly concerned for her case and mourned much
over her plight; but, for all he could do to soothe her, love-longing
only increased on her.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King
mourned much over his daughter’s plight but, for all he could do
to soothe her, love-longing only increased on her. Thus far concerning
the King and Princess Shams al-Nahár; but as regards
Prince Kamar al-Akmar, when he had risen high in air, he turned
his horse’s head towards his native land, and being alone mused
upon the beauty of the Princess and her loveliness. Now he had
enquired of the King’s people the name of the city and of its King
and his daughter; and men had told him that it was the city of
Sana’á.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2092" id="noteref-2092" epub:type="noteref">2092</a> So he journeyed with all speed, till he drew near his
father’s capital and, making an airy circuit about the city, alighted
on the roof of the King’s palace, where he left his horse, whilst he
descended into the palace and seeing its threshold strewn with
ashes, thought that one of his family was dead. Then he entered,
as of wont, and found his father and mother and sisters clad in
mourning raiment of black, all pale of faces and lean of frames.
When his sire descried him and was assured that it was indeed his
son, he cried out with a great cry and fell down in a fit, but after
a time coming to himself, threw himself upon him and embraced
him, clipping him to his bosom and rejoicing in him with exceeding
joy and extreme gladness. His mother and sisters heard this; so
they came in and seeing the Prince, fell upon him, kissing him and
weeping, and joying with exceeding joyance. Then they questioned
him of his case; so he told them all that had past from first to
last, and his father said to him, “Praised be Allah for thy safety,
O coolth of my eyes and core of my heart!” Then the King bade
hold high festival, and the glad tidings flew through the city. So
they beat drums and cymbals and, doffing the weed of mourning,
they donned the gay garb of gladness and decorated the streets
and markets; whilst the folk vied with one another who should be
the first to give the King joy, and the King proclaimed a general
pardon and opening the prisons, released those who were therein
prisoned. Moreover, he made banquets for the people, with great
abundance of eating and drinking, for seven days and nights and
all creatures were gladsomest; and he took horse with his son
and rode out with him, that the folk might see him and rejoice.
After awhile the Prince asked about the maker of the horse,
saying, “O my father, what hath fortune done with him?”; and
the King answered, “Allah never bless him nor the hour wherein
I set eyes on him! For he was the cause of thy separation from
us, O my son, and he hath lain in gaol since the day of thy disappearance.”
Then the King bade release him from prison and,
sending for him, invested him in a dress of satisfaction and entreated
him with the utmost favour and munificence, save that he would
not give him his daughter to wife; whereat the Sage raged with
sore rage and repented of that which he had done, knowing that
the Prince had secured the secret of the steed and the manner of
its motion. Moreover, the King said to his son, “I reck thou wilt
do well not to go near the horse henceforth and more especially
not to mount it after this day; for thou knowest not its properties,
and belike thou art in error about it.” Now the Prince had told his
father of his adventure with the King of Sana’a and his daughter
and he said, “Had the King intended to kill thee, he had done so;
but thine hour was not yet come.” When the rejoicings were at
an end, the people returned to their places and the King and his
son to the palace, where they sat down and fell to eating and
drinking and making merry. Now the King had a handsome
handmaiden who was skilled in playing the lute; so she took it
and began to sweep the strings and sing thereto before the King
and his son of separation of lovers, and she chanted the following
verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Deem not that absence breeds in me aught of forgetfulness; ✿ What should remember I did you fro’ my remembrance wane?</div>
      <div class="line">Time dies but never dies the fondest love for you we bear; ✿ And in your love I’ll die and in your love I’ll arise again.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2093" id="noteref-2093" epub:type="noteref">2093</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the Prince heard these verses, the fires of longing flamed
up in his heart and pine and passion redoubled upon him. Grief
and regret were sore upon him and his bowels yearned in him for
love of the King’s daughter of Sana’a; so he rose forthright and,
escaping his father’s notice, went forth the palace to the horse
and mounting it, turned the pin of ascent, whereupon birdlike
it flew with him high in air and soared towards the upper regions
of the sky. In early morning his father missed him and, going
up to the pinnacle of the palace, in great concern, saw his son
rising into the firmament; whereat he was sore afflicted and repented
in all penitence that he had not taken the horse and
hidden it; and he said to himself, “By Allah, if but my son
return to me, I will destroy the horse, that my heart may be at
rest concerning my son.” And he fell again to weeping and bewailing
himself——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King that the King
again fell to weeping and bewailing himself for his son. Such was
his case; but as regards the Prince, he ceased not flying on through
air till he came to the city of Sana’a and alighted on the roof as
before. Then he crept down stealthily and, finding the eunuch
asleep, as of wont, raised the curtain and went on little by little, till
he came to the door of the Princess’s alcove<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2094" id="noteref-2094" epub:type="noteref">2094</a>-chamber and stopped
to listen; when lo! he heard her shedding plenteous tears and
reciting verses, whilst her women slept round her. Presently, overhearing
her weeping and wailing quoth they, “O our mistress, why
wilt thou mourn for one who mourneth not for thee?” Quoth she,
“O ye little of wit, is he for whom I mourn of those who forget or
who are forgotten?” And she fell again to wailing and weeping,
till sleep overcame her. Hereat the Prince’s heart melted for her
and his gall-bladder was like to burst, so he entered and, seeing
her lying asleep without covering,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2095" id="noteref-2095" epub:type="noteref">2095</a> touched her with his hand;
whereupon she opened her eyes and espied him standing by her.
Said he, “Why all this crying and mourning?” And when she
knew him, she threw herself upon him, and took him around the
neck and kissed him and answered, “For thy sake and because of
my separation from thee.” Said he, “O my lady, I have been
made desolate by thee all this long time!” But she replied, “‘Tis
thou who hast desolated <em>me</em>; and hadst thou tarried longer, I had
surely died!” Rejoined he, “O my lady, what thinkest thou of
my case with thy father and how he dealt with me? Were it not
for my love of thee, O temptation and seduction of the Three
Worlds, I had certainly slain him and made him a warning to all
beholders; but, even as I love thee, so I love him for thy sake.”
Quoth she, “How couldst thou leave me: can my life be sweet to
me after thee?” Quoth he, “Let what hath happened suffice:
I am now hungry, and thirsty.” So she bade her maidens make
ready meat and drink, and they sat eating and drinking and conversing
till night was well nigh ended; and when day broke he
rose to take leave of her and depart, ere the eunuch should
awake. Shams al-Nahar asked him, “Whither goest thou?”; and
he answered, “To my father’s house, and I plight thee my troth
that I will come to thee once in every week.” But she wept and
said, “I conjure thee, by Allah the Almighty, take me with thee
whereso thou wendest and make me not taste anew the bitter-gourd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2096" id="noteref-2096" epub:type="noteref">2096</a>
of separation from thee.” Quoth he, “Wilt thou indeed go
with me?” and quoth she, “Yes.” “Then,” said he, “arise that
we depart.” So she rose forthright and going to a chest, arrayed
herself in what was richest and dearest to her of her trinkets of
gold and jewels of price, and she fared forth her handmaids
recking naught. So he carried her up to the roof of the palace
and, mounting the ebony horse, took her up behind him and made
her fast to himself, binding her with strong bonds; after which he
turned the shoulder-pin of ascent, and the horse rose with him
high in air. When her slave-women saw this, they shrieked aloud
and told her father and mother, who in hot haste ran to the palace-roof
and looking up, saw the magical horse flying away with the
Prince and Princess. At this the King was troubled with ever-increasing
trouble and cried out, saying, “O King’s son, I conjure
thee, by Allah, have ruth on me and my wife and bereave us not
of our daughter!” The Prince made him no reply; but, thinking
in himself that the maiden repented of leaving father and mother,
asked her, “O ravishment of the age, say me, wilt thou that I
restore thee to thy mother and father?”: whereupon she answered,
“By Allah, O my lord, that is not my desire: my only wish is to
be with thee, wherever thou art; for I am distracted by the love
of thee from all else, even from my father and mother.” Hearing
these words the Prince joyed with great joy, and made the horse
fly and fare softly with them, so as not to disquiet her; nor did
they stay their flight till they came in sight of a green meadow,
wherein was a spring of running water. Here they alighted and
ate and drank; after which the Prince took horse again and set her
behind him, binding her in his fear for her safety; after which they
fared on till they came in sight of his father’s capital. At this,
the Prince was filled with joy and bethought himself to show his
beloved the seat of his dominion and his father’s power and dignity
and give her to know that it was greater than that of her sire.
So he set her down in one of his father’s gardens without the city
where his parent was wont to take his pleasure; and, carrying her
into a domed summer-house prepared there for the King, left the
ebony horse at the door and charged the damsel keep watch over
it, saying, “Sit here, till my messenger come to thee; for I go
now to my father, to make ready a palace for thee and show thee
my royal estate.” She was delighted when she heard these words
and said to him, “Do as thou wilt;”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the maiden
was delighted when she heard these words and said to him, “Do as
thou wilt;” for she thereby understood that she should not enter
the city but with due honour and worship, as became her rank.
Then the Prince left her and betook himself to the palace of the
King his father, who rejoiced in his return and met him and
welcomed him; and the Prince said to him, “Know that I have
brought with me the King’s daughter of whom I told thee; and
have left her without the city in such a garden and come to tell
thee, that thou mayst make ready the procession of estate and go
forth to meet her and show her thy royal dignity and troops and
guards.” Answered the King, “With joy and gladness”; and
straightway bade decorate the town with the goodliest adornment.
Then he took horse and rode out in all magnificence and majesty,
he and his host, high officers and household, with drums and
kettledrums, fifes and clarions and all manner instruments; whilst
the Prince drew forth of his treasuries jewellery and apparel and
what else of the things which Kings hoard and made a rare display
of wealth and splendour: moreover he got ready for the Princess
a canopied litter of brocades, green, red and yellow, wherein
he set Indian and Greek and Abyssinian slave-girls. Then he left
the litter and those who were therein and preceded them to the pavilion
where he had set her down; and searched but found naught,
neither Princess nor horse. When he saw this, he beat his face
and rent his raiment and began to wander round about the garden,
as he had lost his wits; after which he came to his senses and said
to himself, “How could she have come at the secret of this horse,
seeing I told her nothing of it? Maybe the Persian sage who
made the horse hath chanced upon her and stolen her away, in
revenge for my father’s treatment of him.” Then he sought the
guardians of the garden and asked them if they had seen any pass
the precincts; and said, “Hath any one come in here? Tell me
the truth and the whole truth or I will at once strike off your
heads.” They were terrified by his threats; but they answered
with one voice, “We have seen no man enter save the Persian sage,
who came to gather healing herbs.” So the Prince was certified
that it was indeed he that had taken away the maiden——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince heard their answer, he was certified that the Sage had taken
away the maiden and abode confounded and perplexed concerning
his case. And he was abashed before the folk and, turning to his
sire, told him what had happened and said to him, “Take the
troops and march them back to the city. As for me, I will never
return till I have cleared up this affair.” When the King heard
this, he wept and beat his breast and said to him, “O my son, calm
thy choler and master thy chagrin and come home with us and
look what King’s daughter thou wouldst fain have, that I may
marry thee to her.” But the Prince paid no heed to his words and
farewelling him departed, whilst the King returned to the city and
their joy was changed into sore annoy. Now, as Destiny issued her
decree, when the Prince left the Princess in the garden-house and
betook himself to his father’s palace, for the ordering of his affair,
the Persian entered the garden to pluck certain simples and, scenting
the sweet savour of musk and perfumes that exhaled from the
Princess and impregnated the whole place, followed it till he came
to the pavilion and saw standing at the door the horse which he had
made with his own hands. His heart was filled with joy and gladness,
for he had bemourned its loss much since it had gone out of
his hand: so he went up to it and, examining its every part, found it
whole and sound; whereupon he was about to mount and ride away,
when he bethought himself and said, “Needs must I first look
what the Prince hath brought and left here with the horse.” So
he entered the pavilion and, seeing the Princess sitting there, as
she were the sun shining sheen in the sky serene, knew her at the
first glance to be some high-born lady and doubted not but the
Prince had brought her thither on the horse and left her in the
pavilion, whilst he went to the city, to make ready for her entry
in state procession with all splendour. Then he went up to her
and kissed the earth between her hands, whereupon she raised her
eyes to him and, finding him exceedingly foul of face and favour,
asked, “Who art thou?”; and he answered, “O my lady, I am a
messenger sent by the Prince who hath bidden me bring thee to
another pleasance nearer the city; for that my lady the Queen
cannot walk so far and is unwilling, of her joy in thee, that
another should forestall her with thee.” Quoth she, “Where is
the Prince?”; and quoth the Persian, “He is in the city, with his
sire and forthwith he shall come for thee in great state.” Said she,
“O thou! say me, could he find none handsomer to send to me?”;
whereat loud laughed the Sage and said, “Yea verily, he hath not
a Mameluke as ugly as I am; but, O my lady, let not the ill-favour
of my face and the foulness of my form deceive thee.
Hadst thou profited of me as hath the Prince, verily thou wouldst
praise my affair. Indeed, he chose me as his messenger to thee,
because of my uncomeliness and loathsomeness in his jealous
love of thee: else hath he Mamelukes and negro slaves, pages,
eunuchs and attendants out of number, each goodlier than
other.” Whenas she heard this, it commended itself to her
reason and she believed him; so she rose forthright——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Persian sage acquainted the Princess with the case of the King’s
son, she believed him; so she rose forthright; and, putting her
hand in his, said, “O my father, what hast thou brought me to
ride?” He replied, “O my lady, thou shalt ride the horse thou
camest on;” and she, “I cannot ride it by myself.” Whereupon
he smiled and knew that he was her master and said, “I will ride
with thee myself.” So he mounted and, taking her up behind him
bound her to himself with firm bonds, while she knew not what he
would with her. Then he turned the ascent-pin, whereupon the
belly of the horse became full of wind and it swayed to and fro like
a wave of the sea, and rose with them high in air nor slackened
in its flight, till it was out of sight of the city. Now when Shams
al-Nahar saw this, she asked him, “Ho thou! what is become of
that thou toldest me of my Prince, making me believe that he
sent thee to me?” Answered the Persian, “Allah damn the Prince!
he is a mean and skin-flint knave.” She cried, “Woe to thee!
How darest thou disobey thy lord’s commandment?” Whereto the
Persian replied, “He is no lord of mine: knowest thou who I
am?” Rejoined the Princess, “I know nothing of thee save what
thou toldest me;” and retorted he, “What I told thee was a trick
of mine against thee and the King’s son: I have long lamented
the loss of this horse which is under us; for I constructed it and
made myself master of it. But now I have gotten firm hold of it and
of thee too, and I will burn his heart even as he hath burnt mine;
nor shall he ever have the horse again; no, never! So be of good
cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; for I can be of more
use to thee than he; and I am generous as I am wealthy; my
servants and slaves shall obey thee as their mistress; I will robe
thee in finest raiment and thine every wish shall be at thy will.”
When she heard this, she buffeted her face and cried out, saying,
“Ah, well-away! I have not won my beloved and I have lost
my father and mother!” And she wept bitter tears over what
had befallen her, whilst the Sage fared on with her, without
ceasing, till he came to the land of the Greeks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2097" id="noteref-2097" epub:type="noteref">2097</a> and alighted in
a verdant mead, abounding in streams and trees. Now this
meadow lay near a city wherein was a King of high puissance,
and it chanced that he went forth that day to hunt and divert
himself. As he passed by the meadow, he saw the Persian
standing there, with the damsel and the horse by his side; and,
before the Sage was ware, the King’s slaves fell upon him and
carried him and the lady and the horse to their master who,
noting the foulness of the man’s favour and his loathsomeness
and the beauty of the girl and her loveliness, said, “O my lady,
what kin is this oldster to thee?” The Persian made haste to
reply, saying, “She is my wife and the daughter of my father’s
brother.” But the lady at once gave him the lie and said, “O
King, by Allah, I know him not, nor is he my husband; nay, he
is a wicked magician who hath stolen me away by force and
fraud.” Thereupon the King bade bastinado the Persian and
they beat him till he was well-nigh dead; after which the King
commanded to carry him to the city and cast him into jail; and,
taking from him the damsel and the ebony horse (though he
knew not its properties nor the secret of its motion), set the girl
in his serraglio and the horse amongst his hoards. Such was the
case with the Sage and the lady; but as regards Prince Kamar
al-Akmar, he garbed himself in travelling gear and taking what
he needed of money, set out tracking their trail in very sorry
plight; and journeyed from country to country and city to city
seeking the Princess and enquiring after the ebony horse, whilst all
who heard him marvelled at him and deemed his talk extravagant.
Thus he continued doing a long while; but, for all his enquiry and
quest, he could hit on no news of her. At last he came to her
father’s city of Sana’a and there asked for her, but could get no
tidings of her and found her father mourning her loss. So he
turned back and made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to
enquire concerning the twain as he went——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King’s
son made for the land of the Greeks, continuing to enquire concerning
the two as he went along, till, as chance would have it, he
alighted at a certain Khan and saw a company of merchants
sitting at talk. So he sat down near them and heard one say, “O
my friends, I lately witnessed a wonder of wonders.” They asked,
“What was that?” and he answered, “I was visiting such a district
in such a city (naming the city wherein was the Princess),
and I heard its people chatting of a strange thing which had
lately befallen. It was that their King went out one day hunting
and coursing with a company of his courtiers and the lords of his
realm; and, issuing from the city, they came to a green meadow
where they espied an old man standing, with a woman sitting hard
by a horse of ebony. The man was foulest-foul of face and loathly
of form, but the woman was a marvel of beauty and loveliness and
elegance and perfect grace; and as for the wooden horse, it was a
miracle, never saw eyes aught goodlier than it nor more gracious
than its make.” Asked the others, “And what did the King
with them?”; and the merchant answered, “As for the man the
King seized him and questioned him of the damsel and he pretended
that she was his wife and the daughter of his paternal
uncle; but she gave him the lie forthright and declared that he
was a sorcerer and a villain. So the King took her from the old
man and bade beat him and cast him into the trunk-house. As
for the ebony horse, I know not what became of it.” When the
Prince heard these words, he drew near to the merchant and began
questioning him discreetly and courteously touching the name of
the city and of its King; which when he knew, he passed the
night full of joy. And as soon as dawned the day he set out and
travelled sans surcease till he reached that city; but, when he
would have entered, the gatekeepers laid hands on him, that they
might bring him before the King to question him of his condition
and the craft in which he skilled and the cause of his coming
thither—such being the usage and custom of their ruler. Now
it was supper-time when he entered the city, and it was then
impossible to go in to the King or take counsel with him respecting
the stranger. So the guards carried him to the jail, thinking
to lay him by the heels there for the night; but, when the warders
saw his beauty and loveliness, they could not find it in their hearts
to imprison him: they made him sit with them without the walls;
and, when food came to them, he ate with them what sufficed him.
As soon as they had made an end of eating, they turned to the
Prince and said, “What countryman art thou?” “I come from
Fars,” answered he, “the land of the Chosroës.” When they
heard this they laughed and one of them said, “O Chosroan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2098" id="noteref-2098" epub:type="noteref">2098</a> I
have heard the talk of men and their histories and I have looked
into their conditions; but never saw I or heard I a bigger liar
than the Chosroan which is with us in the jail.” Quoth another,
“And never did I see aught fouler than his favour or more hideous
than his visnomy.” Asked the Prince, “What have ye seen of his
lying?”; and they answered, “He pretendeth that he is one of the
wise! Now the King came upon him, as he went a-hunting, and
found with him a most beautiful woman and a horse of the
blackest ebony, never saw I a handsomer. As for the damsel, she
is with the King, who is enamoured of her and would fain marry
her; but she is mad, and were this man a leach as he claimeth to
be, he would have healed her, for the King doth his utmost to
discover a cure for her case and a remedy for her disease, and this
whole year past hath he spent treasures upon physicians and
astrologers, on her account; but none can avail to cure her. As
for the horse, it is in the royal hoard-house, and the ugly man
is here with us in prison; and as soon as night falleth, he weepeth
and bemoaneth himself and will not let us sleep.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
warders had recounted the case of the Persian egromancer they
held in prison and his weeping and wailing, the Prince at once
devised a device whereby he might compass his desire; and presently
the guards of the gate, being minded to sleep, led him into
the jail and locked the door. So he overheard the Persian weeping
and bemoaning himself, in his own tongue, and saying, “Alack, and
alas for my sin, that I sinned against myself and against the King’s
son, in that which I did with the damsel; for I neither left her nor
won my will of her! All this cometh of my lack of sense, in that
I sought for myself that which I deserved not and which befitted
not the like of me; for whoso seeketh what suiteth him not at all,
falleth with the like of my fall.” Now when the King’s son heard
this, he accosted him in Persian, saying, “How long will this weeping
and wailing last? Say me, thinkest thou that hath befallen thee
that which never befel other than thou?” Now when the Persian
heard this, he made friends with him and began to complain to
him of his case and misfortunes. And as soon as the morning
morrowed, the warders took the Prince and carried him before their
King, informing him that he had entered the city on the previous
night, at a time when audience was impossible. Quoth the King
to the Prince, “Whence comest thou and what is thy name and
trade and why hast thou travelled hither?” He replied, “As to
my name I am called in Persian Harjah;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2099" id="noteref-2099" epub:type="noteref">2099</a> as to my country I come
from the land of Fars; and I am of the men of art and especially
of the art of medicine and healing the sick and those whom the
Jinns drive mad. For this I go round about all countries and
cities, to profit by adding knowledge to my knowledge, and whenever
I see a patient I heal him and this is my craft.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2100" id="noteref-2100" epub:type="noteref">2100</a> Now when
the King heard this, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, “O
excellent Sage, thou hast indeed come to us at a time when we
need thee.” Then he acquainted him with the case of the Princess,
adding, “If thou cure her and recover her from her madness, thou
shalt have of me everything thou seekest.” Replied the Prince,
“Allah save and favour the King: describe to me all thou hast
seen of her insanity and tell me how long it is since the access
attacked her; also how thou camest by her and the horse and the
Sage.” So the King told him the whole story, from first to last,
adding, “The Sage is in gaol<a id="t28"></a>.” Quoth the Prince, “O auspicious
King, and what hast thou done with the horse?” Quoth the King,
“O youth, it is with me yet, laid up in one of my treasure-chambers,”
whereupon said the Prince within himself, “The best thing I
can do is first to see the horse and assure myself of its condition.
If it be whole and sound, all will be well and end well; but, if its
motor-works be destroyed, I must find some other way of delivering
my beloved.” Thereupon he turned to the King and said to
him, “O King, I must see the horse in question: haply I may find
in it somewhat that will serve me for the recovery of the damsel.”
“With all my heart,” replied the King, and taking him by the
hand, showed him into the place where the horse was. The Prince
went round about it, examining its condition, and found it whole
and sound, whereat he rejoiced greatly and said to the King,
“Allah save and exalt the King! I would fain go in to the
damsel, that I may see how it is with her; for I hope in Allah to
heal her by my healing hand through means of the horse.” Then
he bade them take care of the horse and the King carried him to
the Princess’s apartment, where her lover found her wringing her
hands and writhing and beating herself against the ground, and
tearing her garments to tatters as was her wont; but there was no
madness of Jinn in her, and she did this but that none might
approach her. When the Prince saw her thus, he said to her, “No
harm shall betide thee, O ravishment of the three worlds;” and
went on to soothe her and speak her fair, till he managed to
whisper, “I am Kamar al-Akmar;” whereupon she cried out with
a loud cry and fell down fainting for excess of joy; but the King
thought this was epilepsy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2101" id="noteref-2101" epub:type="noteref">2101</a> brought on by her fear of him, and by
her suddenly being startled. Then the Prince put his mouth to
her ear and said to her, “O Shams al-Nahar, O seduction of the
universe, have a care for thy life and mine and be patient and
constant; for this our position needeth sufferance and skilful contrivance
to make shift for our delivery from this tyrannical King.
My first move will be now to go out to him and tell him that thou
art possessed of a Jinn and hence thy madness; but that I will
engage to heal thee and drive away the evil spirit, if he will at once
unbind thy bonds. So when he cometh in to thee, do thou speak
him smooth words, that he may think I have cured thee, and all
will be done for us as we desire.” Quoth she, “Hearkening and
obedience;” and he went out to the King in joy and gladness,
and said to him, “O august King, I have, by thy good fortune,
discovered her disease and its remedy, and have cured her for
thee. So now do thou go in to her and speak her softly and treat
her kindly, and promise her what may please her; so shall all thou
desirest of her be accomplished to thee.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Seventieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince feigned himself a leach and went in to the damsel and
made himself known to her and told her how he purposed to
deliver her, she cried “Hearkening and obedience!” He then fared
forth from her and sought the King and said, “Go thou in to her
and speak her softly and promise her what may please her; so
shall all thou desirest of her be accomplished to thee.” Thereupon
the King went in to her and when she saw him, she rose and
kissing the ground before him, bade him welcome and said, “I
admire how thou hast come to visit thy handmaid this day;”
whereat he was ready to fly for joy and bade the waiting-women
and the eunuchs attend her and carry her to the Hammam and
make ready for her dresses and adornment. So they went in to
her and saluted her, and she returned their salams with the goodliest
language and after the pleasantest fashion; whereupon they clad
her in royal apparel and, clasping a collar of jewels about her neck,
carried her to the bath and served her there. Then they brought
her forth, as she were the full moon; and, when she came into
the King’s presence, she saluted him and kissed ground before him;
whereupon he joyed in her with joy exceeding and said to the
Prince, “O Sage, O philosopher, all this is of thy blessing. Allah
increase to us the benefit of thy healing breath!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2102" id="noteref-2102" epub:type="noteref">2102</a> The Prince
replied, “O King, for the completion of her cure it behoveth that
thou go forth, thou and all thy troops and guards, to the place
where thou foundest her, not forgetting the beast of black wood
which was with her; for therein is a devil; and, unless I exorcise
him, he will return to her and afflict her at the head of every
month.” “With love and gladness,” cried the King, “O thou Prince
of all philosophers and most learned of all who see the light of
day.” Then he brought out the ebony horse to the meadow in
question and rode thither with all his troops and the Princess, little
weeting the purpose of the Prince. Now when they came to the
appointed place, the Prince, still habited as a leach, bade them set
the Princess and the steed as far as eye could reach from the King
and his troops, and said to him, “With thy leave, and at thy word,
I will now proceed to the fumigations and conjurations, and here
imprison the adversary of mankind, that he may never more return
to her. After this, I shall mount this wooden horse which seemeth
to be made of ebony, and take the damsel up behind me; whereupon
it will shake and sway to and fro and fare forwards, till it
come to thee, when the affair will be at an end; and after this thou
mayst do with her as thou wilt.” When the King heard his words,
he rejoiced with extreme joy; so the Prince mounted the horse,
and, taking the damsel up behind him, whilst the King and his
troops watched him, bound her fast to him. Then he turned the
ascending-pin and the horse took flight and soared with them
high in air, till they disappeared from every eye. After this the
King abode half the day, expecting their return; but they returned
not. So when he despaired of them, repenting him greatly of that
which he had done and grieving sore for the loss of the damsel, he
went back to the city with his troops. He then sent for the Persian
who was in prison and said to him, “O thou traitor, O thou villain,
why didst thou hide from me the mystery of the ebony horse?
And now a sharper hath come to me and hath carried it off,
together with a slave-girl whose ornaments are worth a mint of
money, and I shall never see anyone or anything of them again!”
So the Persian related to him all his past, first and last, and the
King was seized with a fit of fury which well-nigh ended his life.
He shut himself up in his palace for a while, mourning and
afflicted; but at last his Wazirs came in to him and applied themselves
to comfort him, saying, “Verily, he who took the damsel is
an enchanter, and praised be Allah who hath delivered thee from
his craft and sorcery!” And they ceased not from him, till he
was comforted for her loss. Thus far concerning the King; but as
for the Prince, he continued his career towards his father’s capital
in joy and cheer, and stayed not till he alighted on his own palace,
where he set the lady in safety; after which he went in to his
father and mother and saluted them and acquainted them with her
coming, whereat they were filled with solace and gladness. Then
he spread great banquets for the towns-folk——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King’s
son spread great banquets for the towns-folk and they held high
festival a whole month, at the end of which time he went in to the
Princess and they took their joy of each other with exceeding joy.
But his father brake the ebony horse in pieces and destroyed its
mechanism for flight; moreover the Prince wrote a letter to the
Princess’s father, advising him of all that had befallen her and
informing him how she was now married to him and in all health
and happiness, and sent it by a messenger, together with costly
presents and curious rarities. And when the messenger arrived at
the city which was Sana’a and delivered the letter and the presents
to the King, he read the missive and rejoiced greatly thereat and
accepted the presents, honouring and rewarding the bearer handsomely.
Moreover, he forwarded rich gifts to his son-in-law by
the same messenger, who returned to his master and acquainted
him with what had passed; whereat he was much cheered. And
after this the Prince wrote a letter every year to his father-in-law
and sent him presents till, in course of time, his sire King Sabur
deceased and he reigned in his stead, ruling justly over his lieges
and conducting himself well and righteously towards them, so that
the land submitted to him and his subjects did him loyal service;
and Kamar al-Akmar and his wife Shams al-Nahar abode in the
enjoyment of all satisfaction and solace of life, till there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and Sunderer of societies; the
Plunderer of palaces, the Caterer for cemeteries and the Garnerer
of graves. And now glory be to the Living One who dieth not
