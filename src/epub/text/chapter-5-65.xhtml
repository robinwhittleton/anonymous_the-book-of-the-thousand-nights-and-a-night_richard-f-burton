<p>Al-Hajjaj bin Yusuf al-Sakafi had been long in pursuit of
a certain man of the notables, and when at last he was brought
before him, he said, “O enemy of Allah, He hath delivered thee
over to me;” and cried, “Hale him to prison and lay him by the
heels in heavy fetters and build a closet over him, that he may not
come forth of it nor any go into him.” So they bore him to jail and
summoned the blacksmith with the irons; and every time the
smith gave a stroke with his hammer, the prisoner raised his eyes
to heaven and said, “Is not the whole Creation and the Empire
thereof His?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2553" id="noteref-2553" epub:type="noteref">2553</a> Then the gaolers built the cage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2554" id="noteref-2554" epub:type="noteref">2554</a> over him and
left him therein, lorn and lone, whereupon longing and consternation
entered into him and the tongue of his case recited in
extempore verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Wish of wistful men, for Thee I yearn; ✿ My heart seeks grace of one no heart shall spurn.</div>
      <div class="line">Unhidden from thy sight is this my case; ✿ And for one glance of thee I pine and burn.</div>
      <div class="line">They jailed and tortured me with sorest pains:✿ Alas for lone one can no aid discern’!</div>
      <div class="line">But, albe lone, I find Thy name befriends ✿ And cheers, though sleep to eyes shall ne’er return:</div>
      <div class="line">An thou accept of me, I care for naught; ✿ And only Thou what’s in my heart canst learn!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when night fell dark, the gaoler left his watchmen to guard
him and went to his house; and on the morrow, when he came to
the prison, he found the fetters lying on the ground and the
prisoner gone; whereat he was affrighted and made sure of death.
So he returned to his place and bade his family farewell, after
which he took in his sleeve his shroud and the sweet herbs for his
corpse, and went in to Al-Hajjáj. And as he stood before the
presence, the Governor smelt the perfumes and asked, “What is
that?” when the gaoler answered, “O my lord, it is I who have
brought it.” “And what moved thee to that?” enquired the
Governor; whereupon he told him his case,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
gaoler told his case to Al-Hajjaj, the Governor cried, “Woe to
thee! Didst thou hear him say aught?” Answered the gaoler,
“Yes! whilst the blacksmith was hammering his irons, he ceased
not to look up heavenwards and say:—Is not the whole Creation
and the Empire thereof His?” Rejoined Al-Hajjaj, “Dost thou
not know that He, on whom he called in thy presence, delivered
him in thine absence?” And the tongue of the case recited on
this theme:—</p>
