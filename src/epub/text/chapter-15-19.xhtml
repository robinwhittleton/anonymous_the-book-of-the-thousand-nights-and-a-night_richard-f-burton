			<h2 epub:type="title">The Woman Who Humoured Her Lover at Her Husband’s Expense<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7581" id="noteref-7581" epub:type="noteref">7581</a></h2>

<p>There was a man in Cairo and he had a wife who ever boasted of
her gentle blood and her obedience and her docility and her fear of
the Lord. Now she happened to have in the house a pair of fatted
ganders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7582" id="noteref-7582" epub:type="noteref">7582</a> and she also had a lover whom she kept in the background.
Presently the man came to visit her and seeing beside
her the plump birds felt his appetite sharpened by them, so he said
to her, “O Such-an-one, needs must thou let cook these two geese
with the best of stuffing so that we may make merry over them,
for that my mind is bent upon eating goose-flesh.” Quoth she,
“’Tis right easy; and by thy life, O So-and-so, I will slaughter
them and stuff them and thou shalt take them and carry them
home with thee and eat them, nor shall this pimp my husband
taste of them or even smell them.” “How wilt thou do?” asked
he, and she answered, “I will serve him a sleight shall enter into
his brains and then give them to thee, for none is dear to me as
thyself, O thou light of mine eyes; whereas this pander my mate
shall not touch a bittock thereof.” Upon this agreement the lover
went from her and when her husband returned at sunset-tide she
said to him, “Ho Man, how canst thou ever call thyself a man
when thou never invitest anybody to thy house and no day of the
days thou sayest me:—I have a guest coming to us; even as
another would do; and folk surely will talk of thee and declare
thou art a miser and unknowing the ways of generosity.” “O
Woman,” said he, “this were for me an easy business and
to-morrow morning (Inshallah!) I will buy for thee flesh and rice
and thou shalt let cook for us or dinner or supper, whereto I will
invite one of my intimates.” Quoth she to him, “Nay, O Man;
rather do thou buy for me a pound of mince-meat; then slaughter
the two geese and I will stuff them and fry them, for that nothing
is more savoury to set before guests.” Said he, “Upon my head
and mine eye be it!” and as soon as it was dawn he slaughtered
the geese and went forth and bought a Rotolo of meat which he
minced and took all was required of rice and hot spices and what not
else. These he carried home to his wife and said to her, “Do thou
finish off thy cooking before midday when I will bring my guests,”
and presently he fared forth from her. Then she arose and cleaned
out the geese and stuffed them with minced meat and a portion of
rice and almonds and raisins;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7583" id="noteref-7583" epub:type="noteref">7583</a> and fried them until they were well
cooked; after which she sent for her lover and as soon as he came
she and he made merry together, and she gave him the geese which
he took up and left her.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the woman
gave to her lover the geese which she had fried and he took the
twain and fared away with them. Now when it was noon suddenly
her husband came home accompanied by a friend and knocked at
the door; so she arose and opened to him and admitted them.
Then she asked, “And hast thou brought only one man?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7584" id="noteref-7584" epub:type="noteref">7584</a> hie thee
forth and fetch at least two or better still three.” “’Tis well,” said
he and went off to do her bidding. Then the woman accosted
the guest who came first and cried, “Oh the pity of it! By Allah
thou art lost and the Lá Haul of Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7585" id="noteref-7585" epub:type="noteref">7585</a> is upon thee and doubtless
thou hast no children.” Now when the man heard these words he
exclaimed, “Why, O Woman?” for indeed fear and affright had
sunk deep into his heart. She rejoined, “Verily my husband hath
not brought thee hither save with the intention of cutting off thy
precious stones the honours of thy yard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7586" id="noteref-7586" epub:type="noteref">7586</a> and of gelding thee to a
Castrato; and heigho and alas for thee whether thou die or
whether thou live, and Oh the pity of it for thee!” Now when
the man heard this speech, he arose in haste and hurry and rushed
out by the door when behold, the husband came bringing with him
two of his familiars. So the wife met him at the entrance and
said to him, “O Man, O miserablest of men, O thou disappointed,
O thou dissatisfied,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7587" id="noteref-7587" epub:type="noteref">7587</a> thou hast brought to me a fellow which
was a thief, a ne’er-do-well like unto thyself.” “How so?” asked
he, and she answered, “The man stole the two geese and stole
away.” Thereupon the husband went out and catching sight of the
guest running off shouted to him, “Come back! Come back! even
although thou bring only one with thee and take the other.” Cried
the man in reply, “An thou catch me do thou take thee the two.”
But the house-master meant the two geese whilst the man who was
running away thought only of himself, saying in his mind, “This
one speaketh of my ballocks, meaning that he will take only one
of my stones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7588" id="noteref-7588" epub:type="noteref">7588</a> and leave me the other.” So he ceased not running
and the other followed after him, but being unable to catch him
he returned to his guests and served them with somewhat of bread
and so forth, whilst the woman kept blaming him and knagging
about the matter of the geese which she said had been carried off,
but which had been given by her to her lover. The husband enjoined
her to silence; however she would not hold her peace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7589" id="noteref-7589" epub:type="noteref">7589</a> and
on this wise he was balked of the meal to feed his wife’s friend.
And now (quoth Shahrazad) I will relate to you somewhat of the
wiles of an honest woman, and thereupon she fell to recounting
the adventure of</p>
