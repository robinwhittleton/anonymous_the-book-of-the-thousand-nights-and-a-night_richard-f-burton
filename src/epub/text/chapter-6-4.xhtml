			<h2 epub:type="title">Judar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2908" id="noteref-2908" epub:type="noteref">2908</a> and His Brethren</h2>

<p>There was once a man and a merchant named Omar and he had
for issue three sons, the eldest called Sálim, the youngest Júdar,
and the cadet Salím. He reared them all till they came to man’s
estate, but the youngest he loved more than his brothers, who,
seeing this, waxed jealous of Judar and hated him. Now when
their father, who was a man shotten in years, saw that his two
eldest sons hated their brother, he feared lest after his death
trouble should befal him from them. So he assembled a company
of his kinsfolk, together with divers men of learning and
property-distributors of the Kazi’s court, and bidding bring all his
monies and cloth, said to them, “O folk, divide ye this money and
stuff into four portions according to the law.” They did so, and
he gave one part to each of his sons and kept the fourth himself,
saying, “This was my good and I have divided it among them in
my lifetime; and this that I have kept shall be for my wife, their
mother, wherewithal to provide for her subsistence whenas she
shall be a widow.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
merchant had divided his money and stuff into four portions, he
said, “This share shall be for my wife, their mother, wherewithal
to provide for her subsistence whenas she shall be a widow.” A
little while after this he died, and neither of the two elder brothers
was content with his share,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2909" id="noteref-2909" epub:type="noteref">2909</a> but sought more of Judar, saying, “Our
father’s wealth is in thy hands.” So he appealed to the judges;
and the Moslems who had been present at the partition came and
bore witness of that which they knew, wherefore the judge forbade
them from one another; but Judar and his brothers wasted much
money in bribes to him. After this, the twain left him awhile;
presently, however, they began again to plot against him and he
appealed a second time to the magistrate, who once more decided
in his favour; but all three lost much money which went to the
judges. Nevertheless Sálim and Salím forbore not to seek his
hurt and to carry the case from court to court,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2910" id="noteref-2910" epub:type="noteref">2910</a> he and they losing
till they had given all their good for food to the oppressors and
they became poor, all three. Then the two elder brothers went to
their mother and flouted her and beat her, and seizing her money
drave her away. So she betook herself to her son Judar and told
him how his brothers had dealt with her and fell to cursing the
twain. Said he, “O my mother, do not curse them, for Allah will
requite each of them according to his deed.” But, O mother mine,
see, I am become poor, and so are my brethren, for strife occasioneth
loss ruin-rife, and we have striven amain, and fought, I and
they, before the judges, and it hath profited us naught: nay, we
have wasted all our father left us and are disgraced among the folk
by reason of our testimony one against other. Shall I then contend
with them anew on thine account and shall we appeal to the
judges? This may not be! Rather do thou take up thine abode
with me, and the scone I eat I will share with thee. Do thou pray
for me and Allah will give me the means of thine alimony. Leave
them to receive of the Almighty the recompense of their deed,
and console thyself with the saying of the poet who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If a fool oppress thee bear patiently; ✿ And from Time expect thy revenge to see:</div>
      <div class="line">Shun tyranny; for if mount oppressed ✿ A mount, ‘twould be shattered by tyranny.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And he soothed and comforted her till she consented and took up
her dwelling with him. Then he gat him a net and went a-fishing
every day in the river or the banks about Bulák and old Cairo or
some other place in which there was water; and one day he would
earn ten coppers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2911" id="noteref-2911" epub:type="noteref">2911</a> another twenty and another thirty, which he
spent upon his mother and himself, and they ate well and drank
well. But, as for his brothers, they plied no craft and neither sold
nor bought; misery and ruin and overwhelming calamity entered
their houses and they wasted that which they had taken from their
mother and became of the wretched naked beggars. So at times
they would come to their mother, humbling themselves before
her exceedingly and complaining to her of hunger; and she (a
mother’s heart being pitiful) would give them some mouldy, sour-smelling
bread or, if there were any meat cooked the day before,
she would say to them, “Eat it quick and go ere your brother
come; for ‘twould be grievous to him and he would harden his
heart against me, and ye would disgrace me with him.” So they
would eat in haste and go. One day among days they came in to
their mother, and she set cooked meat and bread before them. As
they were eating, behold, in came their brother Judar, at whose
sight the parent was put to shame and confusion, fearing lest he
should be wroth with her; and she bowed her face earthwards
abashed before her son. But he smiled in their faces, saying,
“Welcome, O my brothers! A blessed day!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2912" id="noteref-2912" epub:type="noteref">2912</a> How comes it
that ye visit me this blessed day?” Then he embraced them both
and entreated them lovingly, saying to them, “I thought not that
ye would have left me desolate by your absence nor that ye would
have forborne to come and visit me and your mother.” Said they,
“By Allah, O our brother, we longed sore for thee and naught
withheld us but abashment because of what befel between us and
thee; but indeed we have repented much. ‘Twas Satan’s doing,
the curse of Allah the Most High be upon him! And now we
have no blessing but thyself and our mother.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Judar
entered his place and saw his brothers, he welcomed them both,
saying, “And I have no blessing but you twain.” And his mother
exclaimed, “Allah whiten thy face, and increase thy prosperity, for
thou art the most generous of us all, O my son!” Then he said
“Welcome to you both! Abide with me; for the Lord is bountiful
and good aboundeth with me.” So he made peace with them,
and they supped and nighted with him; and next morning, after
they had broken their fast, Judar shouldered his net and went out,
trusting in The Opener<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2913" id="noteref-2913" epub:type="noteref">2913</a> whilst the two others also went forth and
were absent till midday, when they returned and their mother set
the noon-meal before them. At nightfall Judar came home, bearing
meat and greens, and they abode on this wise a month’s space,
Judar catching fish and selling it and spending their price on his
mother and his brothers, and these eating and frolicking till, one
day, it chanced he went down to the river-bank and throwing his
net, brought it up empty. He cast it a second time, but again it
came up empty and he said in himself, “No fish in this place!”
So he removed to another and threw the net there, but without
avail. And he ceased not to remove from place to place till nightfall,
but caught not a single sprat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2914" id="noteref-2914" epub:type="noteref">2914</a> and said to himself, “Wonderful!
Hath the fish fled the river or what?” Then he shouldered the
net and made for home, chagrined, concerned, feeling for his mother
and brothers and knowing not how he should feed them that
night. Presently, he came to a baker’s oven and saw the folk
crowding for bread, with silver in their hands, whilst the baker
took no note of them. So he stood there sighing, and the baker
said to him, “Welcome to thee, O Judar! Dost thou want bread?”
But he was silent and the baker continued, “An thou have no
dirhams, take thy sufficiency and thou shalt get credit.” So Judar
said, “Give me ten coppers’ worth of bread and take this net in
pledge.” Rejoined the baker, “Nay, my poor fellow, the net is
thy gate of earning thy livelihood, and if I take it from thee, I
shall close up against thee the door of thy subsistence. Take thee
ten Nusfs’ worth of bread and take these other ten, and to-morrow
bring me fish for the twenty.” “On my head and eyes be it!”
quoth Judar and took the bread and money saying, “To-morrow
the Lord will dispel the trouble of my case and will provide me
the means of acquittance.” Then he bought meat and vegetables
and carried them home to his mother, who cooked them and they
supped and went to bed. Next morning he arose at daybreak
and took the net, and his mother said to him, “Sit down and
break thy fast.” But he said, “Do thou and my brothers breakfast,”
and went down to the river about Bulak where he ceased
not to cast once, twice, thrice; and to shift about all day, without
aught falling to him, till the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when
he shouldered his net and went away sore dejected. His way led
him perforce by the booth of the baker who, when he saw him,
counted out to him the loaves and the money, saying, “Come,
take it and go; an it be not to-day, ‘twill be to-morrow.” Judar
would have excused himself, but the baker said to him, “Go!
There needeth no excuse; an thou had netted aught, it would be
with thee; so seeing thee empty-handed, I knew thou hadst
gotten naught; and if to-morrow thou have no better luck, come
and take bread and be not abashed, for I will give thee credit.”
So Judar took the bread and money and went home. On the
third day also he sallied forth and fished from tank to tank until
the time of afternoon-prayer, but caught nothing; so he went to
the baker and took the bread and silver as usual. On this wise
he did seven days running, till he became disheartened and said
in himself, “To-day I go to the Lake Kárún.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2915" id="noteref-2915" epub:type="noteref">2915</a> So he went thither
and was about to cast his net, when there came up to him unawares
a Maghrabí, a Moor, clad in splendid attire and riding a she-mule
with a pair of gold-embroidered saddle-bags on her back and all
her trappings also orfrayed. The Moor alighted and said to him,
“Peace be upon thee, O Judar, O son of Omar!” “And on thee
likewise be peace, O my lord the pilgrim!” replied the fisherman.
Quoth the Maghrabi, “O Judar, I have need of thee and, given
thou obey me, thou shalt get great good and shalt be my companion
and manage my affairs for me.” Quoth Judar, “O my
lord, tell me what is in thy mind and I will obey thee, without
demur.” Said the Moor, “Repeat the Fatihah, the Opening
Chapter of the Koran.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2916" id="noteref-2916" epub:type="noteref">2916</a> So he recited it with him and the Moor
bringing out a silken cord, said to Judar, “Pinion my elbows
behind me with this cord, as fast as fast can be, and cast me into
the lake; then wait a little while; and, if thou see me put forth
my hands above the water, raising them high ere my body show,
cast thy net over me and drag me out in haste; but if thou see
me come up feet foremost, then know that I am dead; in which
case do thou leave me and take the mule and saddle-bags and
carry them to the merchants’ bazar, where thou wilt find a Jew
by name Shamáyah. Give him the mule and he will give thee an
hundred dinars, which do thou take and go thy ways and keep the
matter secret with all secrecy.” So Judar tied his arms tightly
behind his back and he kept saying, “Tie tighter.” Then said he,
“Push me till I fall into the lake:” so he pushed him in and he
sank. Judar stood waiting some time till, behold, the Moor’s feet
appeared above the water, whereupon he knew that he was dead.
So he left him and drove the mule to the bazar, where seated on a
stool at the door of his storehouse he saw the Jew who spying the
mule, cried, “In very sooth the man hath perished,” adding, “and
naught undid him but covetise.” Then he took the mule from
Judar and gave him an hundred dinars, charging him to keep the
matter secret. So Judar went and bought what bread he needed,
saying to the baker, “Take this gold piece!”; and the man
summed up what was due to him and said, “I still owe thee two
days’ bread”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Judar,
when the baker after summing up what was due to him said, “I
still owe thee two days’ bread,” replied, “Good,” and went on to
the butcher, to whom he gave a gold piece and took meat, saying,
“Keep the rest of the dinar on account.” Then he bought vegetables
and going home, found his brothers importuning their mother
for victual, whilst she cried, “Have patience till your brother come
home, for I have naught.” So he went in to them and said, “Take
and eat;” and they fell on the food like cannibals. Then he gave
his mother the rest of his gold saying, “If my brothers come to
thee, give them wherewithal to buy food and eat in my absence.”
He slept well that night and next morning he took his net and
going down to Lake Karun stood there and was about to cast his
net, when behold, there came up to him a second Maghribi, riding
on a she-mule more handsomely accoutred than he of the day
before and having with him a pair of saddle-bags of which each
pocket contained a casket. “Peace be with thee, O Judar!” said
the Moor: “And with thee be peace, O my lord, the pilgrim!”
replied Judar. Asked the Moor, “Did there come to thee yesterday
a Moor riding on a mule like this of mine?” Hereat Judar
was alarmed and answered, “I saw none,” fearing lest the other
say, “Whither went he?” and if he replied, “He was drowned in
the lake,” that haply he should charge him with having drowned
him; wherefore he could not but deny. Rejoined the Moor,
“Harkye, O unhappy!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2917" id="noteref-2917" epub:type="noteref">2917</a> this was my brother, who is gone before
me.” Judar persisted, “I know naught of him.” Then the Moor
enquired, “Didst thou not bind his arms behind him and throw
him into the lake, and did he not say to thee:—If my hands appear
above the water first, cast thy net over me and drag me out in
haste; but, if my feet show first, know that I am dead and carry
the mule to the Jew Shamayah, who shall give thee an hundred
dinars.” Quoth Judar, “Since thou knowest all this why and
wherefore dost thou question me?”; and quoth the Moor, “I
would have thee do with me as thou didst with my brother.”
Then he gave him a silken cord, saying, “Bind my hands behind
me and throw me in, and if I fare as did my brother, take the
mule to the Jew and he will give thee other hundred dinars.”
Said Judar, “Come on;” so he came and he bound him and
pushed him into the lake, where he sank. Then Judar sat watching
and after awhile, his feet appeared above the water and the
fisher said, “He is dead and damned! Inshallah, may Maghribis
come to me every day, and I will pinion them and push them in
and they shall die; and I will content me with an hundred dinars
for each dead man.” Then he took the mule to the Jew, who
seeing him asked, “The other is dead?” Answered Judar, “May
thy head live!”; and the Jew said, “This is the reward of the
covetous!” Then he took the mule and gave Judar an hundred
dinars, with which he returned to his mother. “O my son,” said
she, “whence hast thou this?” So he told her, and she said, “Go
not again to Lake Karun, indeed I fear for thee from the Moors.”
Said he, “O my mother, I do but cast them in by their own wish,
and what am I to do? This craft bringeth me an hundred dinars
a day and I return speedily; wherefore, by Allah, I will not leave
going to Lake Karun, till the trace of the Magháribah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2918" id="noteref-2918" epub:type="noteref">2918</a> is cut off
and not one of them is left.” So, on the morrow which was the
third day, he went down to the lake and stood there, till there
came up a third Moor, riding on a mule with saddle-bags and still
more richly accoutred than the first two, who said to him, “Peace
be with thee, O Judar, O son of Omar!” And the fisherman
saying in himself, “How comes it that they all know me?”
returned his salute. Asked the Maghribi, “Have any Moors
passed by here?” “Two,” answered Judar. “Whither went
they?” enquired the Moor, and Judar replied, “I pinioned their
hands behind them and cast them into the lake, where they were
drowned, and the same fate is in store for thee.” The Moor
laughed and rejoined, saying, “O unhappy! every life hath its
term appointed.” Then he alighted and gave the fisherman the
silken cord, saying, “Do with me, O Judar, as thou didst with
them.” Said Judar, “Put thy hands behind thy back, that I may
pinion thee, for I am in haste, and time flies.” So he put his
hands behind him and Judar tied him up and cast him in. Then
he waited awhile; presently the Moor thrust both hands forth of
the water and called out to him, saying, “Ho, good fellow, cast
out thy net!” So Judar threw the net over him and drew him
ashore, and lo! in each hand he held a fish as red as coral. Quoth
the Moor, “Bring me the two caskets that are in the saddle-bags.”
So Judar brought them and opened them to him, and he laid in
each casket a fish and shut them up. Then he pressed Judar to
his bosom and kissed him on the right cheek and the left, saying,
“Allah save thee from all stress! By the Almighty, hadst thou
not cast the net over me and pulled me out, I should have kept
hold of these two fishes till I sank and was drowned, for I could
not get ashore of myself.” Quoth Judar, “O my lord the pilgrim,
Allah upon thee, tell me the true history of the two drowned men
and the truth anent these two fishes and the Jew.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Tenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Judar asked the Maghribi, saying, “Prithee tell me first of the
drowned men,” the Maghribi answered:—Know, O Judar, that
these drowned men were my two brothers, by name Abd al-Salám
and Abd al-Ahad. My own name is Abd al-Samad, and the Jew
also is our brother; his name is Abd al-Rahím and he is no Jew,
but a true believer of the Maliki school. Our father, whose name
was Abd al-Wadúd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2919" id="noteref-2919" epub:type="noteref">2919</a> taught us magic and the art of solving
mysteries and bringing hoards to light, and we applied ourselves
thereto, till we compelled the Ifrits and Marids of the Jinn to do
us service. By-and-by, our sire died and left us much wealth, and
we divided amongst us his treasures and talismans, till we came to
the books, when we fell out over a volume called “The Fables
of the Ancients,” whose like is not in the world, nor can its price
be paid of any, nor is its value to be evened with gold and jewels;
for in it are particulars of all the hidden hoards of the earth and
the solution of every secret. Our father was wont to make use of
this book, of which we had some small matter by heart, and each
of us desired to possess it, that he might acquaint himself with
what was therein. Now when we fell out there was in our company
an old man by name Cohen Al-Abtan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2920" id="noteref-2920" epub:type="noteref">2920</a> who had reared our
sire and taught him divination and gramarye, and he said to us,
“Bring me the book.” So we gave it him and he continued:—Ye
are my son’s sons, and it may not be that I should wrong any of
you. So whoso is minded to have the volume, let him address
himself to achieve the treasure of Al-Shamardal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2921" id="noteref-2921" epub:type="noteref">2921</a> and bring me the
celestial planisphere and the Kohl-phial and the seal-ring and the
sword. For the ring hath a Marid that serveth it called Al-Ra’ad
al-Kásif;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2922" id="noteref-2922" epub:type="noteref">2922</a> and whoso hath possession thereof, neither King nor
Sultan may prevail against him; and if he will, he may therewith
make himself master of the earth, in all the length and breadth
thereof. As for the brand, if its bearer draw it and brandish it
against an army, the army will be put to the rout; and if he say the
while, “Slay yonder host,” there will come forth of that sword
lightning and fire<a id="t222"></a>, that will kill the whole many. As for the
planisphere, its possessor hath only to turn its face toward any
country, east or west, with whose sight he hath a mind to solace
himself, and therein he will see that country and its people, as they
were between his hands and he sitting in his place; and if he be
wroth with a city and have a mind to burn it, he hath but to face
the planisphere towards the sun’s disc, saying, “Let such a city be
burnt,” and that city will be consumed with fire. As for the Kohl-phial,
whoso pencilleth his eyes therefrom, he shall espy all the
treasures of the earth. And I make this condition with you which
is that whoso faileth to hit upon the hoards shall forfeit his right;
and that none save he who shall achieve the treasure and bring
me the four precious things which be therein shall have any claim
to take this book. So we all agreed to this condition, and he
continued, “O my sons, know that the treasure of Al-Shamardal
is under the commandment of the sons of the Red King, and your
father told me that he had himself essayed to open the treasure,
but could not; for the sons of the Red King fled from him into
the land of Egypt and took refuge in a lake there, called Lake
Karun, whither he pursued them, but could not prevail over them,
by reason of their stealing into that lake, which was guarded by a
spell.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Eleventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Cohen Al-Abtan had told the youths this much, he continued his
tale as follows, “So your father returned empty-handed and
unable to win to his wish; and after failing he complained to me
of his ill-success, whereupon I drew him an astrological figure
and found that the treasure could be achieved only by means of a
young fisherman of Cairo, hight Judar bin Omar, the place of
foregathering with whom was at Lake Karun, for that he should
be the means of capturing the sons of the Red King and that the
charm would not be dissolved, save if he should bind the hands of
the treasure-seeker behind him and cast him into the lake, there to do
battle with the sons of the Red King. And he whose lot it was to
succeed would lay hands upon them; but, if it were not destined
to him he should perish and his feet appear above water. As
for him who was successful, his hands would show first, whereupon
it behoved that Judar should cast the net over him and draw him
ashore.” Now quoth my brothers Abd al-Salam and Abd al-Ahad,
“We will wend and make trial, although we perish;” and
quoth I, “And I also will go;” but my brother Abd al-Rahím (he
whom thou sawest in the habit of a Jew) said, “I have no mind to
this.” Thereupon we agreed with him that he should repair to
Cairo in the disguise of a Jewish merchant, so that, if one of us
perished in the lake, he might take his mule and saddle-bags and
give the bearer an hundred dinars. The first that came to thee
the sons of the Red King slew, and so did they with my second
brother; but against me they could not prevail and I laid hands on
them. Cried Judar, “And where is thy catch?” Asked the
Moor, “Didst thou not see me shut them in the caskets?” “Those
were fishes,” said Judar. “Nay,” answered the Maghribi, “they
are Ifrits in the guise of fish. But, O Judar,” continued he, “thou
must know that the treasure can be opened only by thy means: so
say, wilt thou do my bidding and go with me to the city Fez and
Mequinez<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2923" id="noteref-2923" epub:type="noteref">2923</a> where we will open the treasure?; and after I will give
thee what thou wilt and thou shalt ever be my brother in the bond
of Allah and return to thy family with a joyful heart.” Said
Judar, “O my lord the pilgrim, I have on my neck a mother and
two brothers,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Judar
said to the Maghribi, “I have on my neck a mother and two
brothers, whose provider I am; and if I go with thee, who shall
give them bread to eat?” Replied the Moor, “This is an idle
excuse! if it be but a matter of expenditure, I will give thee a
thousand ducats for thy mother, wherewith she may provide herself
till thou come back: and indeed thou shalt return before the
end of four months.” So when Judar heard mention of the
thousand dinars, he said, “Here with them, O Pilgrim, and I am
thy man;” and the Moor, pulling out the money, gave it to him,
whereupon he carried it to his mother and told her what had
passed between them, saying, “Take these thousand dinars and
expend of them upon thyself and my brothers, whilst I journey to
Marocco with the Moor, for I shall be absent four months, and
great good will betide me; so bless me, O my mother!” Answered
she, “O my son, thou desolatest me and I fear for thee.”
“O my mother,” rejoined he, “no harm can befal him who is in
Allah’s keeping, and the Maghribi is a man of worth;” and he went
on to praise his condition to her. Quoth she, “Allah incline his
heart to thee! Go with him, O my son; peradventure, he will
give thee somewhat.” So he took leave of his mother and rejoined
the Moor Abd al-Samad, who asked him, “Hast thou consulted
thy mother?” “Yes,” answered Judar; “and she blessed me.”
“Then mount behind me,” said the Maghribi. So Judar mounted
the mule’s crupper and they rode on from noon till the time of
mid-afternoon prayer, when the fisherman was an-hungered; but
seeing no victual with the Moor, said to him, “O my lord the
pilgrim, belike thou hast forgotten to bring us aught to eat by the
way?” Asked the Moor, “Art thou hungry?” and Judar answered,
“Yes.” So Abd al-Samad alighted and made Judar alight
and take down the saddle-bags<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2924" id="noteref-2924" epub:type="noteref">2924</a>; then he said to him, “What wilt
thou have, O my brother?” “Anything.” “Allah upon thee,
tell me what thou hast a mind to.” “Bread and cheese.” “O
my poor fellow! bread and cheese besit thee not; wish for something
good.” “Just now everything is good to me.” “Dost thou
like nice browned chicken?” “Yes!” “Dost thou like rice and
honey?” “Yes!” And the Moor went on to ask him if he liked
this dish and that dish till he had named four-and-twenty kinds of
meats; and Judar thought to himself, “He must be daft! Where
are all these dainties to come from, seeing he hath neither cook
nor kitchen? But I’ll say to him, ‘Tis enough!” So he cried,
“That will do: thou makest me long for all these meats, and I
see nothing.” Quoth the Moor, “Thou art welcome, O Judar!”
and, putting his hand into the saddle-bags, pulled out a golden
dish containing two hot browned chickens. Then he thrust his
hand a second time and drew out a golden dish, full of kabobs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2925" id="noteref-2925" epub:type="noteref">2925</a>;
nor did he stint taking out dishes from saddle-bags, till he had
brought forth the whole of the four-and-twenty kinds he had
named, whilst Judar looked on. Then said the Moor, “Fall to,
poor fellow!”, and Judar said to him, “O my lord, thou carriest in
yonder saddle-bags kitchen and kitcheners!” The Moor laughed
and replied, “These are magical saddle-bags and have a servant,
who would bring us a thousand dishes an hour, if we called for
them,” Quoth Judar, “By Allah, a meat thing in saddle-bags!”
Then they ate their fill and threw away what was left; after which
the Moor replaced the empty dishes in the saddle-bags and putting
in his hand, drew out an ewer. They drank and making the
Wuzu-ablution, prayed the mid-afternoon prayer; after which Abd
al-Samad replaced the ewer and the two caskets in the saddle-bags
and throwing them over the mule’s back, mounted and cried,
“Up with thee and let us be off,” presently adding, “O Judar,
knowest thou how far we have come since we left Cairo?” “Not
I, by Allah,” replied he, and Abd al-Samad, “We have come a
whole month’s journey.” Asked Judar, “And how is that?”; and
the Moor answered, “Know, O Judar, that this mule under us is a
Marid of the Jinn who every day performeth a year’s journey;
but, for thy sake, she hath gone an easier pace.” Then they set
out again and fared on westwards till nightfall, when they halted
and the Maghribi brought out supper from the saddle-bags, and in
like manner, in the morning, he took forth wherewithal to break
their fast. So they rode on four days, journeying till midnight
and then alighting and sleeping until morning, when they fared on
again; and all that Judar had a mind to, he sought of the Moor,
who brought it out of the saddle-bags. On the fifth day, they
arrived at Fez and Mequinez and entered the city, where all who
met the Maghribi saluted him and kissed his hands; and he continued
riding through the streets, till he came to a certain door,
at which he knocked, whereupon it opened and out came a girl
like the moon, to whom said he, “O my daughter, O Rahmah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2926" id="noteref-2926" epub:type="noteref">2926</a>
open us the upper chamber.” “On my head and eyes, O my
papa!” replied she and went in, swaying her hips to and fro with
a graceful and swimming gait like a thirsting gazelle, movements
that ravished Judar’s reason, and he said, “This is none other than
a King’s daughter.” So she opened the upper chamber, and the
Moor, taking the saddle-bags from the mule’s back, said, “Go, and
God bless thee!” when lo! the earth clove asunder and swallowing
the mule, closed up again as before. And Judar said, “O
Protector! praised be Allah, who hath kept us in safety on her
back!” Quoth the Maghribi, “Marvel not, O Judar. I told thee
that the mule was an Ifrit; but come with us into the upper chamber.”
So they went up into it, and Judar was amazed at the profusion
of rich furniture and pendants of gold and silver and jewels
and other rare and precious things which he saw there. As soon
as they were seated, the Moor bade Rahmah bring him a certain
bundle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2927" id="noteref-2927" epub:type="noteref">2927</a> and opening it, drew out a dress worth a thousand dinars,
which he gave to Judar, saying, “Don this dress, O Judar, and
welcome to thee!” So Judar put it on and became a fair ensample
of the Kings of the West. Then the Maghribi laid the
saddle-bags before him, and, putting in his hand, pulled out dish
after dish, till they had before them a tray of forty kinds of meat,
when he said to Judar, “Come near, O my master! eat and excuse
us”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Maghribi having served up in the pavilion a tray of forty kinds
of meat, said to Judar, “Come near, O my master, and excuse us
for that we know not what meats thou desirest; but tell us what
thou hast a mind to, and we will set it before thee without delay.”
Replied Judar, “By Allah, O my lord the pilgrim, I love all kinds
of meat and unlove none; so ask me not of aught, but bring all
that cometh to thy thought, for save eating to do I have nought.”
After this he tarried twenty days with the Moor, who clad him in new
clothes every day, and all this time they ate from the saddle-bags;
for the Maghribi bought neither meat nor bread nor aught else, nor
cooked, but brought everything out of the bags, even to various
sorts of fruit. On the twenty-first day, he said, “O Judar, up
with thee; this is the day appointed for opening the hoard of Al-Shamardal.”
So he rose and they went afoot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2928" id="noteref-2928" epub:type="noteref">2928</a> without the city,
where they found two slaves, each holding a she-mule. The Moor
mounted one beast and Judar the other, and they ceased not riding
till noon, when they came to a stream of running water, on whose
banks Abd al-Samad alighted saying, “Dismount, O Judar!”
Then he signed with his hand to the slaves and said, “To it!”
So they took the mules and going each his own way, were absent
awhile, after which they returned, one bearing a tent, which he
pitched, and the other carpets, which he spread in the tent and
laid mattresses<a id="t227"></a>, pillows and cushions there-around. Then one of
them brought the caskets containing the two fishes; and another
fetched the saddle-bags; whereupon the Maghribi arose and said,
“Come, O Judar!” So Judar followed him into the tent and sat
down beside him; and he brought out dishes of meat from the
saddle-bags and they ate the undurn meal. Then the Moor took
the two caskets and conjured over them both, whereupon there
came from within voices that said, “Adsumus, at thy service, O
diviner of the world! Have mercy upon us!” and called aloud for
aid. But he ceased not to repeat conjurations and they to call for
help, till the two caskets flew in sunder, the fragments flying about,
and there came forth two men, with pinioned hands saying,
“Quarter, O diviner of the world! What wilt thou with us?”
Quoth he, “My will is to burn you both with fire, except ye make
a covenant with me, to open to me the treasure of Al-Shamardal.”
Quoth they, “We promise this to thee, and we will open the treasure
to thee, so thou produce to us Judar bin Omar, the fisherman,
for the hoard may not be opened but by his means, nor can any
enter therein save Judar.” Cried the Maghribi, “Him of whom
ye speak, I have brought, and he is here, listening to you and
looking at you.” Thereupon they covenanted with him to open
the treasure to him, and he released them. Then he brought out
a hollow wand and tablets of red carnelian which he laid on the
rod; and after this he took a chafing-dish and setting charcoal
thereon, blew one breath into it and it kindled forthwith. Presently
he brought incense and said, “O Judar, I am now about to
begin the necessary conjurations and fumigations, and when I
have once begun, I may not speak, or the charm will be naught;
so I will teach thee first what thou must do to win thy wish.”
“Teach me,” quoth Judar. “Know,” quoth the Moor, “that when
I have recited the spell and thrown on the incense, the water will
dry up from the river’s bed and discover to thee a golden door,
the bigness of the city-gate, with two rings of metal thereon;
whereupon do thou go down to the door and knock a light knock
and wait awhile; then knock a second time a knock louder than
the first and wait another while; after which give three knocks in
rapid succession, and thou wilt hear a voice ask:—Who knocketh
at the door of the treasure, unknowing how to solve the secrets?
Do thou answer:—I am Judar the fisherman son of Omar: and
the door will open and there will come forth a figure with a brand
in hand who will say to thee: If thou be that man, stretch forth
thy neck, that I may strike off thy head. Then do thou stretch
forth thy neck and fear not; for, when he lifts his hand and smites
thee with the sword, he will fall down before thee, and in a little
thou wilt see him a body sans soul; and the stroke shall not hurt
thee nor shall any harm befal thee; but, if thou gainsay him, he
will slay thee. When thou hast undone his enchantment by obedience,
enter and go on till thou see another door, at which do
thou knock, and there will come forth to thee a horseman riding
a mare with a lance on his shoulder and say to thee:—What
bringeth thee hither, where none may enter ne man ne Jinni?
And he will shake his lance at thee. Bare thy breast to him
and he will smite thee and fall down forthright and thou shalt
see him a body without a soul; but if thou cross him he will
kill thee. Then go on to the third door, whence there will come
forth to thee a man with a bow and arrows in his hand and take
aim at thee. Bare thy breast to him and he will shoot at thee and
fall down before thee, a body without a soul; but if thou oppose
him, he will kill thee. Then go on to the fourth door”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Maghribi said to Judar, “Go on to the fourth door and knock and it
shall be opened to thee, when there will come forth to thee a lion
huge of bulk which will rush upon thee, opening his mouth and
showing he hath a mind to devour thee. Have no fear of him,
neither flee from him: but when he cometh to thee, give him thy
hand and he will bite at it and fall down straightway, nor shall
aught of hurt betide thee. Then enter the fifth door, where thou
shalt find a black slave, who will say to thee, Who art thou? Say, I
am Judar! and he will answer, If thou be that man, open the sixth
door. Then do thou go up to the door and say, O Isa, tell Musa
to open the door; whereupon the door will fly open and thou
wilt see two dragons, one on the left hand and another on the
right, which will open their mouths and fly at thee, both at once.
Do thou put forth to them both hands and they will bite each a
hand and fall down dead; but an thou resist them, they will slay
thee. Then go on to the seventh door and knock, whereupon there
will come forth to thee thy mother and say:—Welcome, O my
son! Come, that I may greet thee! But do thou reply, Hold off
from me and doff thy dress. And she will make answer:—O
my son, I am thy mother and I have a claim upon thee for
suckling thee and for rearing thee: how then wouldst thou strip
me naked? Then do thou say, Except thou put off thy clothes,
I will kill thee! and look to thy right where thou wilt see a sword
hanging up. Take it and draw it upon her, saying, Strip! whereupon
she will wheedle thee and humble herself to thee; but have
thou no ruth on her nor be beguiled, and as often as she putteth
off aught, say to her, off with the lave; nor do thou cease to
threaten her with death, till she doff all that is upon her and fall
down, whereupon the enchantment will be dissolved and the
charms undone, and thou wilt be safe as to thy life. Then enter
the hall of the treasure, where thou wilt see the gold lying in
heaps; but pay no heed to aught thereof, but look to a closet
at the upper end of the hall, where thou wilt see a curtain
drawn. Draw back the curtain and thou wilt descry the enchanter,
Al-Shamardal, lying upon a couch of gold, with something
at his head round and shining like the moon, which is the
celestial planisphere. He is baldrick’d with the sword<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2929" id="noteref-2929" epub:type="noteref">2929</a>; on his
finger is the ring and about his neck hangs a chain, to which
hangs the Kohl-phial. Bring me the four talismans, and beware
lest thou forget aught of that which I have told thee, or thou wilt
repent and there will be fear for thee.” And he repeated his
directions a second and a third and a fourth time, till Judar said,
“I have them by heart: but who may face all these enchantments
that thou namest and endure against these mighty terrors?”
Replied the Moor, “O Judar, fear not, for they are semblances
without life;” and he went on to hearten him, till he said, “I put
my trust in Allah.” Then Abd al-Samad threw perfumes on the
chafing-dish, and addressed himself to reciting conjurations for a
time when, behold, the water disappeared and uncovered the river-bed
and discovered the door of the treasure, whereupon Judar
went down to the door and knocked. Therewith he heard a voice
saying, “Who knocketh at the door of the treasure, unknowing
how to solve the secrets?” Quoth he, “I am Judar son of Omar;”
whereupon the door opened and there came forth a figure with a
drawn sword, who said to him, “Stretch forth thy neck.” So he
stretched forth his neck and the species smote him and fell down,
lifeless. Then he went on to the second door and did the like, nor
did he cease to do thus, till he had undone the enchantments of the
first six doors and came to the seventh door, whence there issued
forth to him his mother, saying, “I salute thee, O my son!” He
asked, “What art thou?”, and she answered, “O my son, I am thy
mother who bare thee nine months and suckled thee and reared
thee.” Quoth he, “Put off thy clothes.” Quoth she, “Thou art
my son, how wouldst thou strip me naked?” But he said “Strip,
or I will strike off thy head with this sword;” and he stretched
out his hand to the brand and drew it upon her saying, “Except
thou strip, I will slay thee.” Then the strife became long
between them and as often as he redoubled on her his threats, she
put off somewhat of her clothes and he said to her, “Doff the rest,”
with many menaces; while she removed each article slowly and
kept saying, “O my son, thou hast disappointed my fosterage of
thee,” till she had nothing left but her petticoat-trousers. Then
said she, “O my son, is thy heart stone? Wilt thou dishonour me
by discovering my shame? Indeed, this is unlawful, O my son!”
And he answered, “Thou sayest sooth; put not off thy trousers.”
At once, as he uttered these words, she cried out, “He hath made
default; beat him!” Whereupon there fell upon him blows like
rain-drops and the servants of the treasure flocked to him and
dealt him a tunding which he forgot not in all his days; after
which they thrust him forth and threw him down without the
treasure and the hoard-doors closed of themselves, whilst the
waters of the river returned to their bed.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
servants of the treasure beat Judar and cast him out and the hoard-doors
closed of themselves, whilst the river-waters returned to their
bed, Abd al-Samad the Maghribi took Judar up in haste and
repeated conjurations over him, till he came to his senses but still
dazed as with drink, when he asked him, “What hast thou done, O
wretch?” Answered Judar, “O my brother, I undid all the
opposing enchantments, till I came to my mother and there befel
between her and myself a long contention. But I made her doff
her clothes, O my brother, till but her trousers remained upon her
and she said to me, Do not dishonour me; for to discover one’s
shame is forbidden. So I left her her trousers out of pity, and
behold, she cried out and said, He hath made default; beat him!
Whereupon there came out upon me folk, whence I know not, and
tunding me with a belabouring which was a Sister of Death, thrust
me forth; nor do I know what befel me after this.” Quoth the
Moor, “Did I not warn thee not to swerve from my directions?
Verily, thou hast injured me and hast injured thyself: for if thou
hadst made her take off her petticoat-trousers, we had won to our
wish; but now thou must abide with me till this day next year.”
Then he cried out to the two slaves, who struck the tent forthright
and loaded it on the beasts; then they were absent awhile and
presently returned with the two mules; and the twain mounted
and rode back to the city of Fez, where Judar tarried with the
Maghribi, eating well and drinking well and donning a grand dress
every day, till the year was ended and the anniversary day
dawned. Then the Moor said to him, “Come with me, for this
is the appointed day.” And Judar said, “‘Tis well.” So the
Maghribi carried him without the city, where they found the two
slaves with the mules, and rode on till they reached the river.
Here the slaves pitched the tent and furnished it; and the Moor
brought forth the tray of food and they ate the morning meal;
after which Abd al-Samad brought out the wand and the tablets
as before and, kindling the fire in the chafing-dish, made ready the
incense. Then said he, “O Judar, I wish to renew my charge to
thee.” “O my lord the pilgrim,” replied he, “if I have forgotten
the bastinado, I have forgotten the injunctions.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2930" id="noteref-2930" epub:type="noteref">2930</a> Asked the Moor,
“Dost thou indeed remember them?” and he answered, “Yes.”
Quoth the Moor, “Keep thy wits, and think not that the woman
is thy very mother; nay, she is but an enchantment in her semblance,
whose purpose is to find thee defaulting. Thou camest off
alive the first time; but, an thou trip this time, they will slay thee.”
Quoth Judar, “If I slip this time, I deserve to be burnt of them.”
Then Abd al-Samad cast the perfumes into the fire and recited the
conjurations, till the river dried up; whereupon Judar descended
and knocked. The door opened and he entered and undid the
several enchantments, till he came to the seventh door and the
semblance of his mother appeared before him, saying, “Welcome,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2931" id="noteref-2931" epub:type="noteref">2931</a>
O my son!” But he said to her, “How am I thy son, O accursed?
Strip!” And she began to wheedle him and put off garment
after garment, till only her trousers remained; and he said to her,
“Strip, O accursed!” So she put off her trousers and became
a body without a soul. Then he entered the hall of the treasures,
where he saw gold lying in heaps, but paid no heed to it and
passed on to the closet at the upper end, where he saw the
enchanter Al-Shamardal lying on a couch of gold, baldrick’d with
the sword, with the ring on his finger, the Kohl-phial on his
breast and the celestial planisphere hanging over his head. So
he loosed the sword and taking the ring, the Kohl-phial and the
planisphere, went forth, when behold, a band of music sounded
for him and the servants of the treasure cried out, saying, “Mayest
thou be assained with that thou hast gained, O Judar!” Nor did
the music leave sounding, till he came forth of the treasure to the
Maghribi, who gave up his conjurations and fumigations and rose
up and embraced him and saluted him. Then Judar made over
to him the four hoarded talismans, and he took them and cried
out to the slaves, who carried away the tent and brought the
mules. So they mounted and returned to Fez-city, where the
Moor fetched the saddle-bags and brought forth dish after dish
of meat, till the tray was full, and said, “O my brother, O Judar,
eat!” So he ate till he was satisfied, when the Moor emptied
what remained of the meats and other dishes and returned the
empty platters to the saddle-bags. Then quoth he, “O Judar,
thou hast left home and native land on our account and thou
hast accomplished our dearest desire; wherefore thou hast a right
to require a reward of us. Ask, therefore, what thou wilt, it is
Almighty Allah who giveth unto thee by our means.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2932" id="noteref-2932" epub:type="noteref">2932</a> Ask thy
will and be not ashamed, for thou art deserving.” “O my lord,”
quoth Judar, “I ask first of Allah the Most High and then of
thee, that thou give me yonder saddle-bags.” So the Maghribi
called for them and gave them to him, saying, “Take them, for
they are thy due; and, if thou hadst asked of me aught else
instead, I had given it to thee. Eat from them, thou and thy
family; but, my poor fellow, these will not profit thee, save by
way of provaunt, and thou hast wearied thyself with us and we
promised to send thee home rejoicing. So we will join to these
other saddle-bags, full of gold and gems, and forward thee back
to thy native land, where thou shalt become a gentleman and a
merchant and clothe thyself and thy family; nor shalt thou want
ready money for thine expenditure. And know that the manner
of using our gift is on this wise. Put thy hand therein and say:—O
servant of these saddle-bags, I conjure thee by the virtue of the
Mighty Names which have power over thee, bring me such a dish!
And he will bring thee whatsoever thou askest, though thou
shouldst call for a thousand different dishes a day.” So saying,
he filled him a second pair of saddle-bags half with gold and half
with gems and precious stones; and, sending for a slave and a
mule, said to him, “Mount this mule, and the slave shall go before
thee and show thee the way, till thou come to the door of thy
house, where do thou take the two pair of saddle-bags and give
him the mule, that he may bring it back. But admit none into
thy secret; and so we commend thee to Allah!” “May the
Almighty increase thy good!” replied Judar and, laying the two
pairs of saddle-bags on the mule’s back, mounted and set forth.
The slave went on before him and the mule followed him all that
day and night, and on the morrow he entered Cairo by the Gate
of Victory,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2933" id="noteref-2933" epub:type="noteref">2933</a> where he saw his mother seated, saying, “Alms, for
the love of Allah!” At this sight he well-nigh lost his wits and
alighting, threw himself upon her: and when she saw him she
wept. Then he mounted her on the mule and walked by her
stirrup,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2934" id="noteref-2934" epub:type="noteref">2934</a> till they came to the house, where he set her down and,
taking the saddle-bags, left the she-mule to the slave, who led her
away and returned with her to his master, for that both slave and
mule were devils. As for Judar, it was grievous to him that his
mother should beg; so, when they were in the house, he asked
her, “O my mother, are my brothers well?”; and she answered,
“They are both well.” Quoth he, “Why dost thou beg by the
wayside?” Quoth she, “Because I am hungry, O my son,” and
he, “Before I went away, I gave thee an hundred dinars one day,
the like the next and a thousand on the day of my departure.”
“O my son, they cheated me and took the money from me,
saying:—We will buy goods with it. Then they drove me away,
and I fell to begging by the wayside, for stress of hunger.” “O
my mother, no harm shall befal thee, now I am come; so have
no concern, for these saddle-bags are full of gold and gems, and
good aboundeth with me.” “Verily, thou art blessed, O my son!
Allah accept of thee and increase thee of His bounties! Go,
O my son, fetch us some victual, for I slept not last night for
excess of hunger, having gone to bed supperless.” “Welcome to
thee, O my mother! Call for what thou wilt to eat, and I will
set it before thee this moment; for I have no occasion to buy
from the market, nor need I any to cook.” “O my son, I see
naught with thee.” “I have with me in these saddle-bags all
manner of meats.” “O my son, whatever is ready will serve to
stay hunger.” “True, when there is no choice, men are content
with the smallest thing; but where there is plenty, they like to
eat what is good: and I have abundance; so call for what thou
hast a mind to.” “O my son, give me some hot bread and a slice
of cheese.” “O my mother, this befitteth not thy condition.”
“Then give me to eat of that which befitteth my case, for thou
knowest it.” “O my mother,” rejoined he, “what suit thine
estate are browned meat and roast chicken and peppered rice and
it becometh thy rank to eat of sausages and stuffed cucumbers
and stuffed lamb and stuffed ribs of mutton and vermicelli with
broken almonds and nuts and honey and sugar and fritters and
almond cakes.” But she thought he was laughing at her and
making mock of her; so she said to him, “Yauh! Yauh!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2935" id="noteref-2935" epub:type="noteref">2935</a> what
is come to thee? Dost thou dream or art thou daft?” Asked
he, “Why deemest thou that I am mad?” and she answered,
“Because thou namest to me all manner rich dishes. Who can
avail unto their price, and who knoweth how to dress them?”
Quoth he, “By my life! thou shalt eat of all that I have named
to thee, and that at once;” and quoth she, “I see nothing;” and
he, “Bring me the saddle-bags.” So she fetched them and feeling
them, found them empty. However, she laid them before him
and he thrust in his hand and pulled out dish after dish, till he
had set before her all he had named. Whereupon asked she, “O
my son, the saddle-bags are small and moreover they were empty;
yet hast thou taken thereout all these dishes. Where then were
they all?”; and he answered, “O my mother, know that these
saddle-bags, which the Moor gave me, are enchanted and they
have a servant whom, if one desire aught, he hath but to adjure
by the Names which command him, saying, “O servant of these
saddle-bags, bring me such a dish! and he will bring it.”” Quoth
his mother, “And may I put out my hand and ask of him?”
Quoth he, “Do so.” So she stretched out her hand and said,
“O servant of the saddle-bags, by the virtue of the Names which
command thee, bring me stuffed ribs.” Then she thrust in her
hand and found a dish containing delicate stuffed ribs of lamb.
So she took it out, and called for bread and what else she had a
mind to: after which Judar said to her, “O my mother, when thou
hast made an end of eating, empty what is left of the food into
dishes other than these, and restore the empty platters to the
saddle-bags carefully.” So she arose and laid them up in a safe
place. “And look, O mother mine, that thou keep this secret,”
added he; “and whenever thou hast a mind to aught, take it
forth of the saddle-bags and give alms and feed my brothers,
whether I be present or absent.” Then he fell to eating with her
and behold, while they were thus occupied, in came his two
brothers, whom a son of the quarter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2936" id="noteref-2936" epub:type="noteref">2936</a> had apprised of his return,
saying, “Your brother is come back, riding on a she-mule, with a
slave before him, and wearing a dress that hath not its like.” So
they said to each other, “Would to Heaven we had not evilly
entreated our mother! There is no hope but that she will surely
tell him how we did by her, and then, oh our disgrace with him!”
But one of the twain said, “Our mother is soft-hearted, and if she
tell him, our brother is yet tenderer over us than she; and, given
we excuse ourselves to him, he will accept our excuse.” So they
went in to him and he rose to them and saluting them with the
friendliest salutation, bade them sit down and eat. So they ate
till they were satisfied, for they were weak with hunger; after
which Judar said to them, “O my brothers, take what is left and
distribute it to the poor and needy.” “O brother,” replied they,
“let us keep it to sup withal.” But he answered, “When suppertime
cometh, ye shall have more than this.” So they took the
rest of the victual and going out, gave it to every poor man who
passed by them, saying, “Take and eat,” till nothing was left.
Then they brought back the dishes and Judar said to his mother,
“Put them in the saddle-bags.”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Sixteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Judar,
when his brethren had finished their under-meal, said to his
mother, “Put back the platters in the saddle-bags.” And when
it was eventide, he entered the saloon and took forth of the saddle-bags
a table of forty dishes; after which he went up to the upper
room and, sitting down between his brothers, said to his mother,
“Bring the supper.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2937" id="noteref-2937" epub:type="noteref">2937</a> So she went down to the saloon and, finding
there the dishes ready, laid the tray and brought up the forty
dishes, one after other. Then they ate the evening meal, and
when they had done, Judar said to his brothers, “Take and feed
the poor and needy.” So they took what was left and gave alms
thereof, and presently he brought forth to them sweetmeats,
whereof they ate, and what was left he bade them give to the
neighbours. On the morrow, they brake their fast after the same
fashion, and thus they fared ten days, at the end of which time
quoth Sálim to Salím, “How cometh it that our brother setteth
before us a banquet in the morning, a banquet at noon, and a
banquet at sundown, besides sweetmeats late at night, and all that
is left he giveth to the poor? Verily, this is the fashion of Sultans.
Yet we never see him buy aught, and he hath neither kitchener
nor kitchen, nor doth he light a fire. Whence hath he this great
plenty? Hast thou not a mind to discover the cause of all
this?” Quoth Salím, “By Allah, I know not: but knowest thou
any who will tell us the truth of the case?” Quoth Sálim,
“None will tell us save our mother.” So they laid a plot and
repairing to their mother one day, in their brother’s absence, said
to her, “O our mother, we are hungry.” Replied she, “Rejoice,
for ye shall presently be satisfied;” and going into the saloon,
sought of the servant of the saddle-bags hot meats, which she took
out and set before her sons. “O our mother,” cried they, “this
meat is hot; yet hast thou not cooked, neither kindled a fire.”
Quoth she, “It cometh from the saddle-bags;” and quoth they,
“What manner of thing be these saddle-bags?” She answered,
“They are enchanted; and the required is produced by the
charm:” she then told her sons their virtue, enjoining them to
secrecy. Said they, “The secret shall be kept, O our mother,
but teach us the manner of this.” So she taught them the fashion
thereof and they fell to putting their hands into the saddle-bags
and taking forth whatever they had a mind to. But Judar knew
naught of this. Then quoth Sálim privily to Salím, “O my
brother, how long shall we abide with Judar servant-wise and eat
of his alms? Shall we not contrive to get the saddle-bags from
him and make off with them?” “And how shall we make shift
to do this?” “We will sell him to the galleys.” “How shall
we do that?” “We two will go to the Raís, the Chief Captain of
the Sea of Suez and bid him to an entertainment, with two of his
company. What I say to Judar do thou confirm, and at the
end of the night I will show thee what I will do.” So they
agreed upon the sale of their brother and going to the Captain’s
quarters said to him, “O Rais, we have come to thee on an
errand that will please thee.” “Good,” answered he; and they
continued, “We two are brethren, and we have a third brother,
a lewd fellow and good-for-nothing. When our father died, he
left us some money, which we shared amongst us, and he took
his part of the inheritance and wasted it in frowardness and
debauchery, till he was reduced to poverty, when he came upon
us and cited us before the magistrates, avouching that we had
taken his good and that of his father, and we disputed the matter
before the judges and lost the money. Then he waited awhile
and attacked us a second time, until he brought us to beggary;
nor will he desist from us, and we are utterly weary of him;
wherefore we would have thee buy him of us.” Quoth the
Captain, “Can ye cast about with him and bring him to me
here? If so, I will pack him off to sea forthright.” Quoth they
“We cannot manage to bring him here; but be thou our guest
this night and bring with thee two of thy men, not one more; and
when he is asleep, we will aid one another to fall upon him, we
five, and seize and gag him. Then shalt thou carry him forth the
house, under cover of the night, and after do thou with him as
thou wilt.” Rejoined the Captain, “With all my heart! Will ye
sell him for forty dinars?” and they, “Yes, come after nightfall to
such a street, by such a mosque, and thou shalt find one of us
awaiting thee.” And he replied, “Now be off.” Then they
repaired to Judar and waited awhile, after which Sálim went up
to him and kissed his hand. Quoth Judar, “What ails thee, O
my brother?” And he made answer, saying, “Know that I have
a friend, who hath many a time bidden me to his house in thine
absence and hath ever hospitably entreated me, and I owe him a
thousand kindnesses, as my brother here wotteth. I met him to-day
and he invited me to his house, but I said to him:—I cannot
leave my brother Judar. Quoth he, Bring him with thee; and
quoth I:—He will not consent to that; but if ye will be my
guests, thou and thy brothers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2938" id="noteref-2938" epub:type="noteref">2938</a> * * * * * (for his brothers were
sitting with him); and I invited them thinking that they would
refuse. But he accepted my invitation for all of them, saying,
Look for me at the gate of the little mosque,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2939" id="noteref-2939" epub:type="noteref">2939</a> and I will come to
thee, I and my brothers. And now I fear they will come and am
ashamed before thee. So wilt thou hearten my heart and entertain
them this night, for thy good is abundant, O my brother?
Or if thou consent not, give me leave to take them into the neighbours’
houses.” Replied Judar, “Why shouldst thou carry them
into the neighbours’ houses? Is our house then so strait or have
we not wherewith to give them supper? Shame on thee to
consult me! Thou hast but to call for what thou needest and
have rich viands and sweetmeats and to spare. Whenever thou
bringest home folk in my absence, ask thy mother, and she will
set before thee victual more than enough. Go and fetch them;
blessings have descended upon us through such guests.” So
Sálim kissed his hand and going forth, sat at the gate of the
little mosque till after sundown, when the Captain and his men
came up to him, and he carried them to the house. When Judar
saw them he bade them welcome and seated them and made
friends of them, knowing not what the future had in store for
him at their hands. Then he called to his mother for supper,
and she fell to taking dishes out of the saddle-bags, whilst
he said, “Bring such and such meats,” till she had set forty
different dishes before them. They ate their sufficiency and the
tray was taken away, the sailors thinking the while that this liberal
entertainment came from Sálim. When a third part of the night
was past, Judar set sweetmeats before them and Sálim served
them, whilst his two brothers sat with the guests, till they sought
to sleep. Accordingly Judar lay down and the others with him,
who waited till he was asleep, when they fell upon him together
and gagging and pinioning him, before he was awake, carried him
forth of the house,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2940" id="noteref-2940" epub:type="noteref">2940</a> under cover of the night,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Seventeenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they seized
Judar and carrying him forth of the house under cover of the
night, at once packed him off to Suez, where they shackled him
and set him to work as a galley-slave; and he ceased not to serve
thus in silence a whole year.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2941" id="noteref-2941" epub:type="noteref">2941</a> So far concerning Judar; but as
for his brothers, they went in next morning to his mother and said
to her, “O our mother, our brother Judar is not awake.” Said
she, “Do ye wake him.” Asked they, “Where lieth he?” and
she answered, “With the guests.” They rejoined, “Haply he
went away with them whilst we slept, O mother. It would seem
that he had tasted of strangerhood and yearned to get at hidden
hoards; for we heard him at talk with the Moors, and they said to
him, We will take thee with us and open the treasure to thee.”
She enquired, “Hath he then been in company with Moors?;”
and they replied, saying, “Were they not our guests yesternight?”
And she, “Most like he hath gone with them, but
Allah will direct him on the right way; for there is a blessing
upon him and he will surely come back with great good.” But
she wept, for it was grievous to her to be parted from her son.
Then said they to her, “O accursed woman, dost thou love Judar
with all this love, whilst as for us, whether we be absent or present,
thou neither joyest in us nor sorrowest for us? Are we not thy
sons, even as Judar is thy son?” She said, “Ye are indeed my
sons: but ye are reprobates who deserve no favour of me, for since
your father’s death I have never seen any good in you; whilst as
for Judar, I have had abundant good of him and he hath heartened
my heart and entreated me with honour; wherefore it behoveth
me to weep for him, because of his kindness to me and to you.”
When they heard this, they abused her and beat her; after which
they sought for the saddle-bags, till they found the two pairs
and took the enchanted one and all the gold from one pouch
and jewels from the other of the unenchanted, saying, “This was
our father’s good.” Said their mother, “Not so, by Allah!; it
belongeth to your brother Judar, who brought it from the land of
the Magharibah.” Said they, “Thou liest, it was our father’s
property; and we will dispose of it, as we please.” Then they
divided the gold and jewels between them; but a brabble arose
between them concerning the enchanted saddle-bags, Sálim saying,
“I will have them;” and Salím, saying, “I will take them;” and
they came to high words. Then said she, “O my sons, ye have
divided the gold and the jewels, but this may not be divided, nor
can its value be made up in money; and if it be cut in twain, its
spell will be voided; so leave it with me and I will give you to
eat from it at all times and be content to take a morsel with you.
If ye allow me aught to clothe me, ‘twill be of your bounty, and
each of you shall traffic with the folk for himself. Ye are my
sons and I am your mother; wherefore let us abide as we are,
lest your brother come back and we be disgraced.” But they
accepted not her words and passed the night, wrangling with each
other. Now it chanced that a Janissary<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2942" id="noteref-2942" epub:type="noteref">2942</a> of the King’s guards was
a guest in the house adjoining Judar’s and heard them through the
open window. So he looked out and listening, heard all the angry
words that passed between them and saw the division of the spoil.
Next morning he presented himself before the King of Egypt,
whose name was Shams al-Daulah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2943" id="noteref-2943" epub:type="noteref">2943</a> and told him all he had heard,
whereupon he sent for Judar’s brothers and put them to the question,
till they confessed; and he took the two pairs of saddle-bags
from them and clapped them in prison, appointing a sufficient
daily allowance to their mother. Now as regards Judar, he abode
a whole year in service at Suez, till one day, being in a ship bound
on a voyage over the sea, a wind arose against them and cast the
vessel upon a rock projecting from a mountain, where she broke
up and all on board were drowned and none gat ashore save
Judar. As soon as he landed he fared on inland, till he reached
an encampment of Badawi, who questioned him of his case, and
he told them he had been a sailor.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2944" id="noteref-2944" epub:type="noteref">2944</a> Now there was in camp a
merchant, a native of Jiddah, who took pity on him and said to
him, “Wilt thou take service with me, O Egyptian, and I will
clothe thee and carry thee with me to Jiddah?” So Judar took
service with him and companied him to Jiddah, where he showed
him much favour. After awhile, his master the merchant set out
on a pilgrimage to Meccah, taking Judar with him, and when they
reached the city, the Cairene repaired to the Haram temple, to
circumambulate the Ka’abah. As he was making the prescribed
circuits,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2945" id="noteref-2945" epub:type="noteref">2945</a> he suddenly saw his friend Abd al-Samad the Moor doing
the like;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Judar, as he
was making the circuits, suddenly saw his friend Abd al-Samad
also circumambulating; and when the Maghribi caught sight of
him, he saluted him and asked him of his state; whereupon Judar
wept and told him all that had befallen him. So the Moor carried
him to his lodging and entreated him with honour, clothing him in
a dress of which the like was not, and saying to him, “Thou hast
seen the end of thine ills, O Judar.” Then he drew out for him a
geomantic figure, which showed what had befallen Sálim and
Salím and said to Judar, “Such and such things have befallen thy
brothers and they are now in the King of Egypt’s prison; but
thou art right welcome to abide with me and accomplish thine
ordinances of pilgrimage and all shall be well.” Replied Judar,
“O my lord, let me go and take leave of the merchant with whom
I am and after I will come back to thee.” “Dost thou owe
money?” asked the Moor, and he answered, “No.” Said Abd
al-Samad, “Go thou and take leave of him and come back forthright,
for bread hath claims of its own from the ingenuous.” So
Judar returned to the merchant and farewelled him, saying, “I
have fallen in with my brother.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2946" id="noteref-2946" epub:type="noteref">2946</a> “Go bring him here,” said the
merchant, “and we will make him an entertainment.” But Judar
answered, saying, “He hath no need of that; for he is a man of
wealth and hath many servants.” Then the merchant gave Judar
twenty dinars, saying, “Acquit me of responsibility”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2947" id="noteref-2947" epub:type="noteref">2947</a> and he
bade him adieu and went forth from him. Presently, he saw a
poor man, so he gave him the twenty ducats and returned to the
Moor, with whom he abode till they had accomplished the pilgrimage-rites
when Abd al-Samad gave him the seal-ring, that he
had taken from the treasure of Al-Shamardal, saying, “This ring
will win thee thy wish, for it enchanteth and hath a servant, by
name Al-Ra’ad al-Kásif; so whatever thou hast a mind to of the
wants of this world; rub this ring and its servant will appear and
do all thou biddest him.” Then he rubbed the ring before him,
whereupon the Jinni appeared, saying, “Adsum, O my lord! Ask
what thou wilt and it shall be given thee. Hast thou a mind to
people a ruined city or ruin a populous one? to slay a king or to
rout a host?” “O Ra’ad,” said Abd al-Samad, “this is become
thy lord; do thou serve him faithfully.” Then he dismissed him
and said to Judar, “Rub the ring and the servant will appear;
and do thou command him to do whatever thou desirest, for he
will not gainsay thee. Now go to thine own country and take
care of the ring, for by means of it thou wilt baffle thine enemies;
and be not ignorant of its puissance.” “O my lord,” quoth Judar,
“with thy leave, I will set out homewards.” Quoth the Maghribi,
“Summon the Jinni and mount upon his back; and if thou say to
him:—Bring me to my native city this very day, he will not
disobey thy commandment.” So he took leave of Moor Abd al-Samad
and rubbed the ring, whereupon Al-Ra’ad presented himself,
saying, “Adsum; ask and it shall be given to thee.” Said
Judar, “Carry me to Cairo this day;” and he replied, “Thy will
be done;” and, taking him on his back, flew with him from noon
till midnight, when he set him down in the courtyard of his
mother’s house and disappeared. Judar went in to his mother,
who rose weeping, and greeted him fondly, and told him how the
King had beaten his brothers and cast them into gaol<a id="t244"></a> and taken
the two pairs of saddle-bags; which when he heard, it was no
light matter to him and he said to her, “Grieve not for the past;
I will show thee what I can do and bring my brothers hither forthright.”
So he rubbed the ring, whereupon its servant appeared,
saying, “Here am I! Ask and thou shalt have.” Quoth Judar,
“I bid thee bring me my two brothers from the prison of the
King.” So the Jinni sank into the earth and came not up but in
the midst of the gaol where Sálim and Salím lay in piteous plight
and sore sorrow for the plagues of prison,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2948" id="noteref-2948" epub:type="noteref">2948</a> so that they wished for
death, and one of them said to the other, “By Allah, O my brother,
affliction is longsome upon us! How long shall we abide in this
prison? Death would be relief.” As he spoke, behold, the earth
clove in sunder and out came Al-Ra’ad, who took both up and
plunged with them into the earth. They swooned away for excess
of fear, and when they recovered, they found themselves in their
mother’s house and saw Judar seated by her side. Quoth he, “I
salute you, O my brothers! you have cheered me by your presence.”
And they bowed their heads and burst into tears. Then
said he, “Weep not, for it was Satan and covetise that led you to
do thus. How could you sell me? But I comfort myself with the
thought of Joseph, whose brothers did with him even more than
ye did with me, because they cast him into the pit.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Judar
said to his brothers, “How could you do with me thus?” But
repent unto Allah and crave pardon of Him, and He will forgive
you both, for He is the Most Forgiving, the Merciful. As for me,
I pardon you and welcome you: no harm shall befal you. Then
he comforted them and set their hearts at ease and related to them
all he had suffered, till he fell in with Shaykh Abd al-Samad, and
told them also of the seal-ring. They replied, “O our brother,
forgive us this time; and, if we return to our old ways, do with us
as thou wilt.” Quoth he, “No harm shall befal you; but tell me
what the King did with you.” Quoth they, “He beat us and
threatened us with death and took the two pairs of saddle-bags
from us.” “Will he not care?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2949" id="noteref-2949" epub:type="noteref">2949</a> said Judar, and rubbed the ring,
whereupon Al-Ra’ad appeared. When his brothers saw him, they
were affrighted and thought Judar would bid him slay them; so
they fled to their mother, crying, “O our mother, we throw ourselves
on thy generosity; do thou intercede for us, O our mother!”
And she said to them, “O my sons, fear nothing!” Then said
Judar to the servant, “I command thee to bring me all that is in
the King’s treasury of goods and such; let nothing remain and
fetch the two pairs of saddle-bags he took from my brothers.” “I
hear and I obey,” replied Al-Ra’ad; and, disappearing straightway
gathered together all he found in the treasury and returned
with the two pairs of saddle-bags and the deposits therein and laid
them before Judar, saying, “O my lord, I have left nothing in the
treasury.” Judar gave the treasure to his mother bidding her keep
it and laying the enchanted saddle-bags before him, said to the
Jinni, “I command thee to build me this night a lofty palace and
overlay it with liquid gold and furnish it with magnificent furniture:
and let not the day dawn, ere thou be quit of the whole
work.” Replied he, “Thy bidding shall be obeyed;” and sank
into the earth. Then Judar brought forth food and they ate and
took their ease and lay down to sleep. Meanwhile, Al-Ra’ad
summoned his attendant Jinn and bade them build the palace. So
some of them fell to hewing stones and some to building, whilst
others plastered and painted and furnished; nor did the day dawn
ere the ordinance of the palace was complete; whereupon Al-Ra’ad
came to Judar and said to him, “O my lord, the palace is finished
and in best order, an it please thee to come and look on it.” So
Judar went forth with his mother and brothers and saw a palace,
whose like there was not in the whole world; and it confounded all
minds with the goodliness of its ordinance. Judar was delighted
with it while he was passing along the highway and withal it had
cost him nothing. Then he asked his mother, “Say me, wilt thou
take up thine abode in this palace?” and she answered, “I will, O
my son,” and called down blessings upon him. Then he rubbed
the ring and bade the Jinni fetch him forty handsome white handmaids
and forty black damsels and as many Mamelukes and negro
slaves. “Thy will be done,” answered Al-Ra’ad and betaking
himself, with forty of his attendant Genii to Hind and Sind and
Persia, snatched up every beautiful girl and boy they saw, till they
had made up the required number. Moreover, he sent other fourscore,
who fetched comely black girls, and forty others brought
male chattels and carried them all to Judar’s house, which they
filled. Then he showed them to Judar, who was pleased with
them and said, “Bring for each a dress of the finest.” “Ready!”
replied the servant. Then quoth he, “Bring a dress for my mother
and another for myself, and also for my brothers.” So the Jinni
fetched all that was needed and clad the female slaves, saying to
them, “This is your mistress: kiss her hands and cross her not, but
serve her, white and black.” The Mamelukes also dressed themselves
and kissed Judar’s hands; and he and his brothers arrayed
themselves in the robes the Jinni had brought them and Judar
became like unto a King and his brothers as Wazirs. Now his
house was spacious; so he lodged Sálim and his slave-girls in one
part thereof and Salím and his slave-girls in another, whilst he and
his mother took up their abode in the new palace; and each in his
own place was like a Sultan. So far concerning them; but as
regards the King’s Treasurer, thinking to take something from the
treasury, he went in and found it altogether empty, even as saith
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">‘Twas as a hive of bees that greatly thrived; ✿ But, when the bee-swarm fled, ‘twas clean unhived.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2950" id="noteref-2950" epub:type="noteref">2950</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So he gave a great cry and fell down in a fit. When he came to
himself, he left the door open and going in to King Shams
al-Daulah, said to him, “O Commander of the Faithful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2951" id="noteref-2951" epub:type="noteref">2951</a> I have
to inform thee that the treasury hath become empty during the
night.” Quoth the King, “What hast thou done with my monies
which were therein?” Quoth he, “By Allah, I have not done
aught with them nor know I what is come of them! I visited the
place yesterday and saw it full; but to-day when I went in, I found
it clean empty, albeit the doors were locked, the walls were unpierced<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2952" id="noteref-2952" epub:type="noteref">2952</a>
and the bolts<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2953" id="noteref-2953" epub:type="noteref">2953</a> are unbroken; nor hath a thief entered
it.” Asked the King, “Are the two pairs of saddle-bags gone?”
“Yes,” replied the Treasurer; whereupon the King’s reason flew
from his head——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Treasurer informed the King that all in the treasury had been
plundered, including the two pairs of saddle-bags, the King’s
reason flew from his head and he rose to his feet, saying, “Go
thou before me.” Then he followed the Treasurer to the treasury
and he found nothing there, whereat he was wroth with him; and
he said to them, “O soldiers! know that my treasury hath been
plundered during the night, and I know not who did this deed
and dared thus to outrage me, without fear of me.” Said they,
“How so?”; and he replied, “Ask the Treasurer.” So they questioned
him, and he answered, saying, “Yesterday I visited the
treasury and it was full, but this morning when I entered it I
found it empty, though the walls were unpierced and the doors
unbroken.” They all marvelled at this and could make the King
no answer, when in came the Janissary, who had denounced Sálim
and Salím, and said to Shams al-Daulah, “O King of the age, all
this night I have not slept for that which I saw.” And the King
asked, “And what didst thou see?” “Know, O King of the age,”
answered the Kawwás, “that all night long I have been amusing
myself with watching builders at work; and, when it was day, I
saw a palace ready edified, whose like is not in the world. So I
asked about it and was told that Judar had come back with great
wealth and Mamelukes and slaves and that he had freed his two
brothers from prison, and built this palace, wherein he is as a
Sultan.” Quoth the King, “Go, look in the prison.” So they
went thither and not finding Sálim and Salím, returned and told
the King, who said, “It is plain now who be the thief; he who
took Sálim and Salím out of prison it is who hath stolen my
monies.” Quoth the Wazir, “O my lord, and who is he?”; and
quoth the King, “Their brother Judar, and he hath taken the two
pairs of saddle-bags; but, O Wazir, do thou send him an Emir
with fifty men to seal up his goods and lay hands on him and his
brothers and bring them to me, that I may hang them.” And
he was sore enraged and said, “Ho, off with the Emir at once,
and fetch them, that I may put them to death.” But the Wazir
said to him, “Be thou merciful, for Allah is merciful and hasteth
not to punish His servants, whenas they sin against Him. Moreover,
he who can build a palace in a single night, as these say,
none in the world can vie with him; and verily I fear lest the
Emir fall into difficulty for Judar. Have patience, therefore,
whilst I devise for thee some device of getting at the truth of
the case, and so shalt thou win thy wish, O King of the age.”
Quoth the King, “Counsel me how I shall do, O Wazir.” And
the Minister said, “Send him an Emir with an invitation; and I
will make much of him for thee and make a show of love for him
and ask him of his estate; after which we will see. If we find
him stout of heart, we will use sleight with him, and if weak of
will, then do thou seize him and do with him thy desire.” The
King agreed to this and despatched one of his Emirs, Othman
hight, to go and invite Judar and say to him, “The King biddeth
thee to a banquet;” and the King said to him, “Return not,
except with him.” Now this Othman was a fool, proud and
conceited; so he went forth upon his errand, and when he came
to the gate of Judar’s palace, he saw before the door an eunuch
seated upon a chair of gold, who at his approach rose not, but
sat as if none came near, though there were with the Emir fifty
footmen. Now this eunuch was none other than Al-Ra’ad al-Kasif,
the servant of the ring, whom Judar had commanded to
put on the guise of an eunuch and sit at the palace-gate. So
the Emir rode up to him and asked him, “O slave, where is
thy lord?”; whereto he answered, “In the palace;” but he
stirred not from his leaning posture; whereupon the Emir
Othman waxed wroth and said to him, “O pestilent slave, art
thou not ashamed, when I speak to thee, to answer me, sprawling
at thy length, like a gallows-bird?” Replied the eunuch,
“Off and multiply not words.” Hardly had Othman heard
this, when he was filled with rage and drawing his mace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2954" id="noteref-2954" epub:type="noteref">2954</a> would
have smitten the eunuch, knowing not that he was a devil;
but Al-Ra’ad leapt upon him and taking the mace from him,
dealt him four blows with it. Now when the fifty men saw
their lord beaten, it was grievous to them; so they drew their
swords and ran to slay the slave; but he said, “Do ye draw
on us, O dogs?” and rose at them with the mace, and every
one whom he smote, he broke his bones and drowned him in
his blood. So they fell back before him and fled, whilst he
followed them, beating them, till he had driven them far from
the palace-gate; after which he returned and sat down on his
chair at the door, caring for none.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Twenty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the eunuch
having put to flight the Emir Othman, the King’s Officer, and his
men, till they were driven far from Judar’s gate, returned and sat
down on his chair at the door, caring for none. But as for the
Emir and his company, they returned, discomfited and tunded, to
King Shams al-Daulah, and Othman said, “O King of the age,
when I came to the palace gate, I espied an eunuch seated there
in a chair of gold and he was passing proud for, when he saw me
approach, he stretched himself at full length albeit he had been
sitting in his chair and entreated me contumeliously, neither offered
to rise to me. So I began to speak to him and he answered without
stirring, whereat wrath gat hold of me and I drew the mace upon
him, thinking to smite him. But he snatched it from me and beat
me and my men therewith and overthrew us. So we fled from
before him and could not prevail against, him.” At this, the King
was wroth and said, “Let an hundred men go down to him.”
Accordingly, the hundred men went down to attack him; but he
arose and fell upon them with the mace and ceased not smiting
them till he had put them to the rout; when he regained his chair;
upon which they returned to the King and told him what had
passed, saying, “O King of the age, he beat us and we fled for
fear of him.” Then the King sent two hundred men against him,
but these also he put to the rout, and Shams Al-Daulah said to
his Minister, “I charge thee, O Wazir, take five hundred men
and bring this eunuch in haste, and with him his master Judar and
his brothers.” Replied the Wazir, “O King of the age, I need no
soldiers, but will go down to him alone and unarmed.” “Go,”
quoth the King, “and do as thou seest suitable.” So the Wazir
laid down his arms and donning a white habit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2955" id="noteref-2955" epub:type="noteref">2955</a> took a rosary in
his hand and set out afoot alone and unattended. When he came
to Judar’s gate, he saw the slave sitting there; So he went up to
him and seating himself by his side courteously, said to him,
“Peace be with thee!”; whereto he replied, “And on thee be
peace, O mortal! What wilt thou?” When the Wazir heard him
say “O mortal,” he knew him to be of the Jinn and quaked for
fear; then he asked him, “O my lord, tell me, is thy master Judar
here?” Answered the eunuch, “Yes, he is in the palace.” Quoth
the Minister, “O my lord, go thou to him and say to him:—King
Shams Al-Daulah saluteth thee and biddeth thee honour his
dwelling with thy presence and eat of a banquet he hath made for
thee.” Quoth the eunuch, “Tarry thou here, whilst I consult
him.” So the Wazir stood in a respectful attitude, whilst the
Marid went up to the palace and said to Judar, “Know, O my
lord, that the King sent to thee an Emir and fifty men, and I beat
them and drove them away. Then he sent an hundred men and I
beat them also; then two hundred, and these also I put to the
rout. And now he hath sent thee his Wazir unarmed, bidding
thee visit him and eat of his banquet. What sayst thou?” Said
Judar, “Go, bring the Wazir hither.” So the Marid went down
and said to him, “O Wazir, come speak with my lord.” “On my
head be it,” replied he and going in to Judar, found him seated, in
greater state than the King, upon a carpet, whose like the King
could not spread, and was dazed and amazed at the goodliness of
the palace and its decoration and appointments, which made him
seem as he were a beggar in comparison. So he kissed the ground
before Judar and called down blessings on him; and Judar said to
him, “What is thy business, O Wazir?” Replied he, “O my lord,
thy friend King Shams Al-Daulah saluteth thee with the salam
and longeth to look upon thy face; wherefore he hath made thee
an entertainment. So say, wilt thou heal his heart and eat of his
banquet?” Quoth Judar, “If he be indeed my friend, salute him
and bid him come to me.” “On my head be it,” quoth the Minister.
Then Judar bringing out the ring rubbed it and bade the
Jinni fetch him a dress of the best, which he gave to the Wazir,
saying, “Don this dress and go tell the King what I say.” So the
Wazir donned the dress, the like whereof he had never donned,
and returning to the King told him what had passed and praised
the palace and that which was therein, saying, “Judar biddeth
thee to him.” So the King called out, “Up, ye men; mount your
horses and bring me my steed, that we may go to Judar!” Then
he and his suite rode off for the Cairene palace. Meanwhile Judar
summoned the Marid and said to him, “It is my will that thou
bring me some of the Ifrits at thy command in the guise of guards
and station them in the open square before the palace, that the
King may see them and be awed by them; so shall his heart
tremble and he shall know that my power and majesty be greater
than his.” Thereupon Al-Ra’ad brought him two hundred Ifrits
of great stature and strength, in the guise of guards, magnificently
armed and equipped, and when the King came and saw these tall
burly fellows his heart feared them. Then he entered the palace,
and found Judar sitting in such state as nor King nor Sultan could
even. So he saluted him and made his obeisance to him; yet
Judar rose not to him nor did him honour nor said “Be seated,”
but left him standing,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Twenty-second Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
King entered, Judar rose not to him, nor did him honour nor even
said “Be seated!”; but left him standing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2956" id="noteref-2956" epub:type="noteref">2956</a> so that fear entered
into him and he could neither sit nor go away and said to himself,
“If he feared me, he would not leave me thus unheeded; peradventure
he will do me a mischief, because of that which I did with
his brothers.” Then said Judar, “O King of the age, it beseemeth
not the like of thee to wrong the folk and take away their
good.” Replied the King, “O my lord, deign excuse me, for greed
impelled me to this and fate was thereby fulfilled; and, were there
no offending, there would be no forgiving.” And he went on to
excuse himself for the past and pray to him for pardon and indulgence
till he recited amongst other things this poetry:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O thou of generous seed and true nobility, ✿ Reproach me not for that which came from me to thee:</div>
      <div class="line">We pardon thee if thou have wrought us any wrong ✿ And if I wrought the wrong I pray thee pardon me!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And he ceased not to humble himself before him, till he said,
“Allah pardon thee!” and bade him be seated. So he sat down
and Judar invested him with garments of pardon and immunity
and ordered his brothers spread the table. When they had eaten,
he clad the whole of the King’s company in robes of honour and
gave them largesse; after which he bade the King depart. So he
went forth and thereafter came every day to visit Judar and held
not his Divan save in his house: wherefore friendship and familiarity
waxed great between them, and they abode thus awhile,
till one day the King, being alone with his Minister, said to him,
“O Wazir, I fear lest Judar slay me and take the kingdom away
from me.” Replied the Wazir, “O King of the age, as for his
taking the kingdom from thee, have no fear of that, for Judar’s
present estate is greater than that of the King, and to take the
kingdom would be a lowering of his dignity; but, if thou fear that
he kill thee, thou hast a daughter: give her to him to wife and
thou and he will be of one condition.” Quoth the King, “O
Wazir, be thou intermediary between us and him”; and quoth the
Minister, “Do thou invite him to an entertainment and pass the
night with him in one of thy saloons. Then bid thy daughter
don her richest dress and ornaments and pass by the door of the
saloon. When he seeth her, he will assuredly fall in love with
her, and when we know this, I will turn to him and tell him that
she is thy daughter and engage him in converse and lead him on,
so that thou shalt seem to know nothing of the matter, till he ask
her of thee to wife. When thou has married him to the Princess,
thou and he will be as one thing and thou wilt be safe from him;
and if he die, thou wilt inherit all he hath, both great and small.”
Replied the King, “Thou sayst sooth, O my Wazir,” and made
a banquet and invited thereto Judar who came to the Sultan’s
palace and they sat in the saloon in great good cheer till the end
of the day. Now the King had commanded his wife to array the
maiden in her richest raiment and ornaments and carry her by the
door of the saloon. She did as he told her, and when Judar saw
the Princess, who had not her match for beauty and grace, he looked
fixedly at her and said, “Ah!”; and his limbs were loosened; for
love and longing and passion and pine were sore upon him; desire
and transport gat hold upon him and he turned pale. Quoth the
Wazir, “May no harm befal thee, O my lord! Why do I see thee
change colour and in suffering?” Asked Judar, “O Wazir, whose
daughter is this damsel? Verily she hath enthralled me and
ravished my reason.” Replied the Wazir, “She is the daughter
of thy friend the King; and if she please thee, I will speak to him
that he marry thee to her.” Quoth Judar, “Do so, O Wazir, and
as I live, I will bestow on thee what thou wilt and will give the
King whatsoever he shall ask to her dowry; and we will become
friends and kinsfolk.” Quoth the Minister, “It shall go hard but
thy desire be accomplished.” Then he turned to the King and
said in his ear, “O King of the age, thy friend Judar seeketh
alliance with thee and will have me ask of thee for him the hand
of thy daughter, the Princess Asiyah; so disappoint me not, but
accept my intercession, and what dowry soever thou askest he
will give thee.” Said the King, “The dowry I have already
received, and as for the girl, she is his handmaid; I give her to
him to wife and he will do me honour by accepting her.”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Wazir whispered the King, “Judar seeketh alliance with thee by
taking thy daughter to wife,” the other replied, “The dowry I have
already received, and the girl is his handmaid; he will do me honour
by accepting her.” So they spent the rest of that night together
and on the morrow the King held a court, to which he summoned
great and small, together with the Shaykh al-Islam.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2957" id="noteref-2957" epub:type="noteref">2957</a> Then Judar
demanded the Princess in marriage and the King said, “The dowry
I have received.” Thereupon they drew up the marriage-contract
and Judar sent for the saddle-bags containing the jewels and gave
them to the King as settlement upon his daughter. The drums
beat and the pipes sounded and they held high festival, whilst
Judar went in unto the girl. Thenceforward he and the King were
as one flesh and they abode thus for many days, till Shams al-Daulah
died; whereupon the troops proclaimed Judar Sultan,
and he refused; but they importuned him, till he consented
and they made him King in his father-in-law’s stead. Then he
bade build a cathedral-mosque over the late King’s tomb in the
Bundukániyah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2958" id="noteref-2958" epub:type="noteref">2958</a> quarter and endowed it. Now the quarter of
Judar’s house was called Yamániyah; but, when he became Sultan
he built therein a congregational mosque and other buildings,
wherefore the quarter was named after him and was called the
Judariyah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2959" id="noteref-2959" epub:type="noteref">2959</a> quarter. Moreover, he made his brother Sálim his
Wazir of the right and his brother Salím his Wazir of the left
hand; and thus they abode a year and no more; for, at the end
of that time, Sálim said to Salím, “O my brother, how long is
this state to last? Shall we pass our whole lives in slavery to
our brother Judar? We shall never enjoy luck or lordship whilst
he lives,” adding, “so how shall we do to kill him and take the
ring and the saddle-bags?” Replied Salím, “Thou art craftier
than I; do thou device, whereby we may kill him.” “If I effect
this,” asked Sálim, “wilt thou agree that I be Sultan and keep
the ring and that thou be my right-hand Wazir and have the
saddle-bags?” Salím answered, “I consent to this;” and they
agreed to slay Judar their brother for love of the world and of dominion.
So they laid a snare for Judar and said to him, “O our
brother, verily we have a mind to glory in thee and would fain
have thee enter our houses and eat of our entertainment and
solace our hearts.” Replied Judar, “So be it, in whose house
shall the banquet be?” “In mine,” said Sálim “and after thou
hast eaten of my victual, thou shalt be the guest of my brother.”
Said Judar, “‘Tis well,” and went with him to his house, where
he set before him poisoned food, of which when he had eaten, his
flesh rotted from his bones and he died.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2960" id="noteref-2960" epub:type="noteref">2960</a> Then Sálim came up to
him and would have drawn the ring from his finger, but it resisted
him; so he cut off the finger with a knife. Then he rubbed the
ring and the Marid presented himself, saying, “Adsum! Ask what
thou wilt.” Quoth Sálim, “Take my brother Salím and put him
to death and carry forth the two bodies, the poisoned and the
slaughtered, and cast them down before the troops.” So the
Mahrid took Salím and slew him; then, carrying the two corpses
forth, he cast them down before the chief officers of the army,
who were sitting at table in the parlour of the house. When
they saw Judar and Salím slain, they raised their hands from the
food and fear gat hold of them and they said to the Marid, “Who
hath dealt thus with the Sultan and the Wazir?” Replied the
Jinni, “Their brother Sálim.” And behold, Sálim came up to
them and said, “O soldiers, eat and make merry, for Judar is
dead and I have taken to me the seal-ring, whereof the Marid
before you is the servant; and I bade him slay my brother Salím
lest he dispute the kingdom with me, for he was a traitor and I
feared lest he should betray me. So now I am become Sultan
over you; will ye accept of me? If not, I will rub the ring and
bid the Marid slay you all, great and small.”——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Sálim said to the officers, “Will ye accept me as your Sultan,
otherwise I will rub the ring and the Marid shall slay you all, great
and small?”; they replied, “We accept thee to King and Sultan.”
Then he bade bury his brothers and summoned the Divan; and
some of the folk followed the funeral, whilst others forewent him
in state procession to the audience-hall of the palace, where he
sat down on the throne and they did homage to him as King;
after which he said, “It is my will to marry my brother Judar’s
wife.” Quoth they, “Wait till the days of widowhood are accomplished.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2961" id="noteref-2961" epub:type="noteref">2961</a>
Quoth he, “I know not days of widowhood nor
aught else. As my head liveth, I needs must go in unto her this
very night.” So they drew up the marriage-contract and sent to
tell the Princess Asiyah, who replied, “Bid him enter.” Accordingly,
he went in to her and she received him with a show of joy
and welcome; but by and by she gave him poison in water and
made an end of him. Then she took the ring and broke it, that
none might possess it thenceforward, and tore up the saddle-bags;
after which she sent to the Shaykh al-Islam and other
great Officers of state, telling them what had passed and saying
to them, “Choose you out a King to rule over you.” And this is
all that hath come down to us of the Story of Judar and his
Brethren.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2962" id="noteref-2962" epub:type="noteref">2962</a> But I have also heard, O King, a tale called the</p>
