			<h2 epub:type="title">The Loves of Al-Hayfá and Yusuf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7277" id="noteref-7277" epub:type="noteref">7277</a></h2>

<p>I had a familiar in the Northern region who was called ’Abd al-Jawád
and he was one of the greatest of merchants there and
made of money; also he loved voyage and travel, and at whatever
time I visited him and we forgathered, I and he, we exchanged
citations of poetry. Now one day my heart yearned to visit him,
so I repaired to his place and found him there; and as we came
together we both sat down in friendly converse, I and he; and he
said to me:—“O my brother, do thou hear what happened and was
accomplished for me in these times. I travelled to the land of
Al-Yaman and therein met a familiar who, when we sat down to
talk, I and he, said:—O my brother, verily there befel me and
betided me in the land of Al-Hind a case that was strange and an
adventure that was admirable and it ran as follows. There was
erewhile a King of the kings of India and one of her greatest,
who was abundant in money and troops and guards and he was
called Al-Mihrján.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7278" id="noteref-7278" epub:type="noteref">7278</a> This same was a lord of high degree and a
majestic and he had lived for a long while of his age without
having issue male or female. Wherefor he was full of cark and
care wanting one who after him would preserve his memory, so he
said in his mind one night of the nights, “Whenas I die cut off
shall be my name, and effaced shall be my fame nor shall anyone
remember me.” So saying he raised both hands to Heaven and
humbled himself before Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) to
vouchsafe him a child who should outlive him with the view that
man might not lose the memory of him. Now one night as he
was sleeping a-bed dreaming and drowned in slumber behold, he
heard a Voice (without seeing any form) which said to him, “O
Mihrjan the Sage, and O King of the Age, arouse thee this
moment and go to thy wife and lie with her and know her
carnally, for she shall indeed conceive of thee at this very hour
and bear thee a child which, an it be a boy shall become thine
aider in all thine affairs but will, an it prove a girl, cause thy ruin
and thy destruction and the uprooting of thy traces.” When
Al-Mihrjan heard from the Speaker these words and such sayings,
he left his couch without stay or delay in great joy and gladness
and he went to his wife and slept with her and swived her and as
soon as he arose from off her she said, “O King of the Age,
verily I feel that I have become pregnant; and (Inshallah—if
Almighty Allah please!) this shall prove the case.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7279" id="noteref-7279" epub:type="noteref">7279</a> When Al-Mihrjan
heard the words of his wife he was glad and rejoiced at
good news and he caused that night be documented in the archives
of his kingdom. Then, when it was morning he took seat upon
the throne of his kingship and summoned the Astrologers and the
Scribes of characts and Students of the skies and told them what
had been accomplished to him in his night and what words he had
heard from the Voice; whereupon the Sages one and all struck
tables of sand and considered the ascendant. But each and every
of them concealed his thought and hid all he had seen nor would
any return a reply or aught of address would supply; and said
they, “O King of the Age, verily appearances in dreams hit the
mark at times and at times fly wide; for when a man is of a
melancholic humour he seeth in his sleep things which be terrible
and horrible and he waxeth startled thereat: haply this vision
thou hast beheld may be of the imbroglios of dreams so do thou
commit the reins to Him who all overreigns and the best Worker
is He of all that wisheth and willeth He.” Now when Al-Mihrjan
heard these words of the Sages and the Star-gazers he gifted and
largessed them and he freed the captives in prison mewed and he
clothed the widows and the poor and nude. But his heart remained
in sore doubt concerning what he had heard from the Voice and he
was thoughtful over that matter and bewildered and he knew not
what to do; and on such wise sped those days. Now, however,
returneth the tale to the Queen his Consort who, when her months
had gone by, proved truly to be pregnant and her condition showed
itself, so she sent to inform her husband thereof. He was gladdened
and rejoiced in the good news and when the months of gestation
were completed the labour-pains set in and she was delivered of a
girl-child (praise be to Him who had created and had perfected
what He had produced in this creation!), which was winsome of
face and lovesome of form and fair fashioned of limbs, with cheeks
rosaceous and eyne gracious and eyebrows continuous and perfect
in symmetrical proportion. Now after the midwives delivered her
from the womb and cut her navel-string and kohl’d her eyes, they
sent for King Al-Mihrjan and informed him that his Queen had
borne a maid-babe, but when the Eunuchs gave this message, his
breast was narrowed and he was bewildered in his wits, and rising
without stay or delay he went to his wife. Here they brought to
him the new-born when he uncovered her face and, noting her
piquancy and elegancy and beauty and brilliancy and size and
symmetry, his vitals fluttered and he was seized with yearning
sorrow for her fate; and he named her Al-Hayfá<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7280" id="noteref-7280" epub:type="noteref">7280</a> for her
seemlihead. Then he gifted the midwife——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King
Al-Mihrjan largessed a robe of honour to the midwife and gifted
her with a thousand gold pieces and went forth from beside his
daughter. Then they committed her to wetnurses and drynurses
and governesses who reared her with the fairest rearing, and after she
had reached the age of four they brought to her divines who lessoned
her in the art of writing and of making selections<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7281" id="noteref-7281" epub:type="noteref">7281</a> and presently she
approved herself sharp of wits, clever, loquent of tongue, eloquent
of speech, sweet spoken of phrase; and every day she increased
in beauty and loveliness and stature and perfect grace. And when
she reached the age of fourteen she was well read in science and
she had perused the annals of the past and she had mastered
astrology and geomancy and she wrote with caligraphic pen all
the seven handwritings and she was mistress of metres and modes
of poetry and still she grew in grace of speech. Now as her age
reached her fourteenth year her sire the Sultan chose for her a
palace and settled her therein and placed about her slave-girls,
high-bosomed virgins numbering an hundred, and each and every
famous for beauty and loveliness; and presently she selected of
them a score who were all maidenhoods, illustrious for comeliness
and seemliness. These she taught in verse and poetry and in the
strangenesses of history and in striking instruments of mirth and
merriment until they surpassed all the folk of their day; and she
assiduously enjoined upon them the drinking of wine pure and
new and boon-companionship with choice histories and strange
tales and the rare events of the time. Such was the case with
Al-Hayfa; but as regards her father, King Al-Mihrjan, as one night
he was lying abed pondering what he had heard from the Voice,
suddenly there addressed him a sound without a form and said,
“O King of the Age,” whereat he was fully aroused by sore terror
and his vitals fluttered and his wits were bewildered and he was
perplexed as to his affair. So he took refuge with Allah from
Satan the Stoned and repeated somewhat of the Koran and fenced
himself about with certain of the holy names of Allah the
Munificent; then he would have returned to his couch but was
unable, even to place cheek on pillow. Presently sounded the
Voice a second time, saying, “O King of the Age, O Mihrjan,
verily shalt thou die by reason of her;” and forthwith improvised
the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ho thou! Hear, O Mihrjan, what to thee shall be said ✿ Learn the drift of my words in these lines convey’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Thy daughter, Al-Hayfa (the girded round ✿ With good, and with highest of grade array’d)</div>
      <div class="line">Shall bring with right hand to thee ruin-bowl ✿ And reave thee of realm with the sharp-biting blade.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7282" id="noteref-7282" epub:type="noteref">7282</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Al-Mihrjan had heard what the Voice had spoken of
verse and had produced for him of prose, he was wholly aroused
from his sleep and became like one drunken with wine who knew
not what he did and his vitals fluttered and increased his cark
and care and anxious thought. So he removed from that site into
another stead and was stirred up and went awandering about. Then
he set his head upon the pillow but was unable to close his eyelids
and the Voice drew nearer and cried upon him in frightful accents
and said, “O Mihrjan, dost thou not hearken to my words and
understand my verse; to wit, that thy daughter Al-Hayfa shall
bequeath to thee shame and thou shalt perish by cause of her?”
Then the Unseen One recited these couplets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7283" id="noteref-7283" epub:type="noteref">7283</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I see thee, O Mihrjan, careless-vain ✿ Who from hearing the words of the wise dost abstain:</div>
      <div class="line">I see Al-Hayfa, by potent lord ✿ Upraised in her charms and speech sweet of strain,</div>
      <div class="line">Who shall home thee in grave sans a doubt and she ✿ Shall seize thy kingship and reave thy reign.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But when Al-Mihrjan had heard the words of the Voice and what
it had urged upon him of poetry and of prose-addresses, he arose
from his rest in haste and anxiety until Allah caused the morn to
morrow and break in its sheen and it shone, whereupon the King
summoned the Mathematicians and the Interpreters of dreams and
the Commentators on the Koran; and, when they came between
his hands, he related to them his vision, fully and formally, and
they practised their several arts, making all apparent to them; but
they concealed the truth and would not reveal it, saying to him,
“Indeed the consequence of thy vision is auspicious.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night an the
Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,
and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Astrologers
said to King Al-Mihrjan, “Verily the consequence of thy vision is
auspicious;” and on the second night Iblis the Accursed appeared
to him under the bodily form of a handsome man and said, “Ho
thou the King, I am he who terrified thee yesternight in thy
dream, for the reason that thou hast ruined the Monastery of the
Archers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7284" id="noteref-7284" epub:type="noteref">7284</a> wherein I lay homed. However an thou wilt edify it
again I will favour thee with my counsel, ho thou the King!”
Al-Mihrjan replied, “Upon me be its rebuilding an thou wilt
honour me with thy advice, ho thou the Voice!” Hereupon
Iblis fell to lying with him and saying, “Verily I am thine aider
in building thee a palace by the river Al-Kawá’ib,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7285" id="noteref-7285" epub:type="noteref">7285</a> O thou will of
me and desire of me!” (Now the folk heard these words spoken
aloud.) Then Al-Mihrjan arose from his sleep joyful and cheerful
and when morning came he summoned the Mathematicians and
Architects and Masons and bade them rebuild the Monastery of
the Archers; so they obeyed his bidding until they had completed
it in the handsomest fashion and with the best of workmanship.
After that the King ordered they construct for his daughter Al-Hayfa
a palace unsurpassed by any edifice and perfectly builded and
decorated, hard by the river Al-Kawa’ib; moreover that it should be
situate in a wady, a hill-girt plain through which meandered the
stream. So they obeyed his bidding and laid its foundations and
marked with large stones the lines thereof which measured a
parasang of length by a parasang of breadth. Then they showed
their design to the King, who gathering together his army returned
with them to the city. Presently the Architects and Master-masons
fell to building it square of corners and towering in air
over the height of an hundred ells and an ell; and amiddlemost
thereof stood a quadrangular hall with four-fold saloons, one
fronting other, whilst in each was set apart a cabinet for private
converse. At the head of every saloon a latticed window projected
over the garden whereof the description shall follow in its
place; and they paved the ground with vari-coloured marbles and
alabastrine slabs which were dubbed with bezel stones and onyx<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7286" id="noteref-7286" epub:type="noteref">7286</a>
of Al-Yaman. The ceilings were inlaid with choice gems and
lapis lazuli and precious metals: the walls were coated with white
stucco painted over with ceruse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7287" id="noteref-7287" epub:type="noteref">7287</a> and the frieze was covered with
silver and gold and ultramarine and costly minerals. Then they
set up for the latticed windows colonnettes of gold and silver and
noble ores, and the doors of the sitting chamber were made of
chaunders-wood alternating with ebony which they studded with
jewels and arabesque’d with gold and silver. Also they placed in
each sitting-room a pillar of Comorin lign-aloes and the best of
sandal-wood encrusted with gems; and over the speak-room they
threw cupolas supported upon arches and connecting columns and
lighted in the upper part by skylights of chrystal and carnelian
and onyx. And at the head of each saloon was a couch of juniper-wood
whose four legs were of elephants’ ivories studded with
rubies and over each was let down a hanging<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7288" id="noteref-7288" epub:type="noteref">7288</a> of golden weft and
a network of gems, whilst higher than the whole was a latticed
casement adorned with pearls which were threaded upon golden
wire and curtains bearing scented satchels of ambergris. The
furniture of the divans was of raw silk stuffed with ostrich-down
and the cushions were purfled with gold. The floors of all the
saloons were spread with carpets and rugs embroidered with
sendal, and in the heart of the Great Hall amiddlemost the four
saloons rose a marble jet-d’eau, square of shape, whose corners
were cunningly wrought and whose floor and marge were set with
gems of every hue. They also placed upon the edges of that
fountain figures fashioned of gold and silver representing all
manner birds and beasts, each modelled according to his several
tint and peculiar form; their bellies too were hollow and from the
fountain was conducted a conduit which led the water into their
insides and caused it gush from their mouths so that they jetted
one at other like two hosts about to do battle. After this the
same water returned to the middle of the fountain and thence
flowed into the gardens, of which a description will follow in its
place.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7289" id="noteref-7289" epub:type="noteref">7289</a> Also the walls of the Great Hall were variegated with
wondrous pictures in gold and lapis lazuli and precious materials
of every kind, and over the doors of the sitting-places they hung
candelabra of chrystal with chains of gold wherein were set jewels
and jacinths and the costliest stones; after which they inscribed
upon the entrance of the speak-rooms couplets to the following
purport:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Clear and clean is our séance from slanderous foe; ✿ And from envious rival whose aim is blame:</div>
      <div class="line">None hither may come save the cup-boy, and eke ✿ Cup-comrades who never our fame defame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Upon the chandeliers themselves were inscribed these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am raised in reverence high o’er head ✿ For they see that my gift is the boon of light:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m a pleasure to eyesight, so up with you all, ✿ O Seers, and joy ye the joys of my sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And upon the Palace-door was inscribed the following quatrain:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“This Mansion’s adorned          ✿ As delight to man’s eye;</div>
      <div class="line">O’er its door writ is ’Welcome,’ ✿ So safely draw nigh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when they had finished this inscription over the doorway,
they went forth from the entrance which stood at the head of the
Great Hall and proceeded to a square of large space abounding in
trees and enjoyable for rills; and they surrounded it with a
fencing-wall built of rough stone which they stuccoed over and
figured with various paintings. Then they planted this garden
with all manner fruit-bearing trees and fragrant herbs and flowers
and firstlings of every kind and hue and they trained the branches
after a wonderful fashion, leading under their shade leats and
runnels of cool water; and the boughs were cunningly dispread so
as to veil the ground which was planted with grains of divers sorts
and greens and all of vegetation that serveth for the food of man.
Also they provided it with a watering wheel whose well was
revetted with alabaster<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7290" id="noteref-7290" epub:type="noteref">7290</a>——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when

    <div>The Six Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Architects set up in that palace-garden a water-wheel whose well
was revetted with alabaster and whose wood-work and wheel
were of chaunders-wood, whilst its pitchers were of fine porcelain
and its cordage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7291" id="noteref-7291" epub:type="noteref">7291</a> was of raw silk. And when they were free of
this work they edified amongst the scented shrubs and blossoms
a towering dome based upon four-square walls of variegated
marbles and alabasters studded with carbuncles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7292" id="noteref-7292" epub:type="noteref">7292</a> and its ceiling
was supported upon columns of the finest stone with joinery of
lign-aloes and sandal, and they dubbed its cupola with jewels and
precious stones and arabesque’d<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7293" id="noteref-7293" epub:type="noteref">7293</a> it with gold and silver. Then
they made therein four saloons more, each fronting other, and
at the head of one and all was a latticed window impending
over the bloomy shrubs and fragrant herbs; the colonnettes of
those casements were silvern whilst the shutters were of sandal-wood
plated and studded with precious metals; and over the
lintels thereof was an ornamental frieze of gold inscribed with
lines of verse which shall be described in its due place. And
they inlaid that frieze with rubies and jacinths until it made the
cupola resemble the domes of Paradise. Moreover they trained
the flowering shrubs and the perfumed herbs to overrun with
their tendrils the casements in the drum of the dome, and when
they had completed the work and had embellished it with all
adornments they pierced for it an entrance and ranged around
it three ramparts which, built up with large stones, were in
breadth seven cubits. Then they edified for the Palace an
impregnable gateway of Chinese steel whereunto led flights of
alabastrine steps which were continued to the highmost parts, and
lastly they derived the river Al-Kawa’ib till it surrounded the
edifice on every side and encircled it as signet-ring girdeth
finger or wristlet wrist. Now when the Architects and Master-masons
had made an end of building the Palace and its domes
and had finished laying out and planting the parterres, they went
in to King Al-Mihrjan and kissing ground between his hands
informed him thereof; and he, receiving this report, at once took
his daughter, Al-Hayfa, and mounting horse, he and the Lords
of his land rode forth till they reached the river Al-Kawa’ib
which ran at three days’ distance from his capital. When he
arrived there and looked upon the Palace and its elevation in
fortalice-form he was pleased therewith and so were all of his
suite and retinue; whereupon he went up to it and beholding the
ordinance and the ornamentation and the cupolas and the gardens
and the edification and embellishment of the whole, he sent for
the Architects and Master-masons and the artificers whom he
thanked for their work, and he bestowed upon them robes of honour
and gifted and largessed them and assigned to them rations and
pay and allowances. So they kissed ground before him and
went their ways. Then King Al-Mihrjan and his host withdrew
within the Palace, and he bade serve up the trays of viands
and sumptuous food for a banquet, after which he and his abode
three days in eating and drinking and diversion and disport;
and he gave robes of honour to his Wazirs and Emirs and the
Grandees of his kingdom, and in fine issued orders for their
departure. When they went forth from him, he commanded to
summon Al-Hayfa and her women with all their belongings;
and she, having made act of presence and having ascended to
the Palace and considered it with its beauty and artifice and
ornamentation, was pleased and rejoiced therein. The father
abode with her three days, and then farewelling her returned to
his capital; and she on his departure bade her slave-girls distribute
the couches about the saloons placing in each one a seat
of ebony plated with glittering gold, whose legs were of elephant’s
ivory, and over one and all they reared canopies of silk and
brocade adorned with jewels and precious metals and bespread
them with mattresses and cushions and pillows, and over the
floor of the palaces they laid down carpets whereupon was
orfrayed this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Friend hereon seated be blythe and gay ✿ Unless hereto bound and debarred of way.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7294" id="noteref-7294" epub:type="noteref">7294</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then they set upon them settees for seats whereupon were
inscribed these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Seat, be thy beauty increased evermore; ✿ Fair fall thee with happiness choice and meet;</div>
      <div class="line">An I fail in life through my slip and sin, ✿ To-morrow in Heav’n I’ll give thee seat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7295" id="noteref-7295" epub:type="noteref">7295</a> the attendants decorated the whole Palace until it became
like unto one of the Mansions of Heaven, and when the women
had done her bidding Al-Hayfa was much pleased, so she took
one of the slave-girls by the hand and walked with the rest of
them around the Palace considering its artifice and its embellishment,
especially the paintings which covered the walls; and they
rejoiced thereat, marvelling at the cunning decorations and they
were grateful to the Architects who had builded and presented all
these representations. And when Al-Hayfa reached the terrace-roof
of the Palace she descended by its long flight of steps which
led to the river-side, and bidding the door be thrown open she
gazed upon the water which encircled it like ring around finger or
armlet round arm, and admired its breadth and its swiftness of
streaming; and she magnified the work and admired the gateway
of steel for its strength and power of defence and sued for
pardon of Almighty Allah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7296" id="noteref-7296" epub:type="noteref">7296</a>——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would

sued pardon of Allah the Great and took refuge with the Almighty
from Satan the Stoned, after which said she, “There is no diverter
to whatso is doomed by the Lord nor availeth aught of solicitude
against that commanded by the Omnipotent, the All-puissant; and
His power is upon me with His destiny and needs must it come
to pass.” Then she called for a pencase of gold and she wrote for
placing over the gateway of the Palace the following couplets:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7297" id="noteref-7297" epub:type="noteref">7297</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

      <div class="line">For within these gates only women wone, ✿ So of men-folk here thou hast naught to affright.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Al-Hayfa had finished her writing and what she had improvised
of verse and couplets, she bade close the entrance of the
Palace and went up, she and her women, to the higher apartments;
and the while she was drowned in thought and fell to saying,
“Would Heaven I knew an this mighty guard and ward will
defend Al-Mihrjan and would I wot if this fortalice will fend off
Fate and what fain must be.” Then she enjoined her women to
high diet and the drinking of wine and listening to intimate converse
and the hearing of songs and musical instruments and
gladness and gaiety for a while of time; and she felt herself safe
from the shifts of chance and change. Such was her case but now
we will recount (Inshallah!) what further befel her.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7300" id="noteref-7300" epub:type="noteref">7300</a> In the land
of Sind was a King hight Sahl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7301" id="noteref-7301" epub:type="noteref">7301</a> and he was of the Monarchs of
might, endowed with puissance and prepotency and exalted degree,
abounding in troops and guards and overruling all that fair region.
Now Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) had vouchsafed him a son
than whom was none in his age fairer of semblance: beautiful exceedingly
was he, with a face brighter far than the full moon; and he
was of tongue eloquent and of pluck puissant, valorous, formidable.
Also he was mighty fond of wine mere and rare and of drinks in
the morning air and of converse with the fair and he delighted in
mirth and merriment and he was assiduous in his carousing which
he would never forego during the watches of the night or the
wards of the day. Now for the abundance of his comeliness and
the brilliancy of his countenance, whenever he walked abroad in
the capital he would swathe his face with the Lithám,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7302" id="noteref-7302" epub:type="noteref">7302</a> lest wax
madly enamoured of him the woman-kind and all creation, wherefore
he was named the Veiled Yúsuf of Beauty. It chanced one
night as he sat carousing with his boon companions that the wine
prevailed over him and he became sprightly and frolicsome; so
he went forth from the door of his cabinet in a state of drink,
understanding naught and knowing nothing of that he did.
He wandered about the rooms belonging to his father and there
he saw a damsel of the paternal concubines standing at the door of
her bower and his wine so mastered him that he went up to her and
clasped her to his bosom and threw her backwards upon the floor.
She cried aloud to the royal Eunuchs who stood there looking on at
him, not one of them, however, dared arrest him or even draw
near him to free the girl, so he had his will of her and abated her
maidenhead after which he rose up from off her and left her all
bleeding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7303" id="noteref-7303" epub:type="noteref">7303</a> from his assault. Now this slave-girl had been gifted to
his sire and Yusuf left her to recover her condition when he would
have visited her again, but as soon as he had returned to his apartment
(and he not knowing what he had done) the Eunuchs took
the damsel (she bleeding as before) and carried her to King Sahl
who seeing her in such case exclaimed, “What man hath done
this to her?” Said they, “’Tis thy son Yusuf;” and he, when he
heard the words of his slaves, felt that this matter was hard upon
him and sent to fetch the Prince. They hastened to bring him,
but amongst the Mamelukes was one lovingly inclined to the youth
who told him the whole tale and how his father had bade the
body-guards summon him to the presence. And when Yusuf had
heard the words of the Mameluke he arose in haste and baldrick’d
his blade and hending his spear in hand he went down to the
stables and saddled him a steed of the noblest blood and likeliest
strain; then he mounted and, taking with him a score of Mamelukes
his pages, he sallied forth with them through the city gate and
rode on unknowing what was concealed from him in the Secret
Purpose.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive.” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince
Yusuf, son of King Sahl, went forth the city all unknowing
whither he should wend and to what part he should turn, and he
ceased not faring with his merry men for ten full-told days, cutting
across the wold and wild and the valley and the stone-clad hill,
and he was perplext as to his affair. But whilst he was still
journeying he came upon the river Al-Kawa’ib and he drew in
sight of the castle of Al-Hayfa, which stood amiddlemost that
mighty stream with its height and bulk and defensive strength.
Hereupon quoth Yusuf to himself, “By Allah, none founded this
puissant fortalice in such power and prepotency and forcefulness
save for a mighty matter and a cause of much consequence.
Would Heaven I wot to whom this belongeth and who dwelleth
therein!” Then he applied his mind and had recourse to the
knowledge of his companions the Mamelukes and he commanded
all his white slaves alight upon the marge of the river for the
purpose of rest, and when they had reposed he asked them, “Who
amongst you will go down to this stream and will over-swim it
and will visit the lord of the Castle and bring us news of it and
tidings of its ownership and discover for us the man to whom
it belongeth?” But as no one would return him a reply he
repeated his words without any answer and he, when he saw that,
arose forthright and doffed what he had upon him of dress, all
save his shirt only. Then he took his bow and quiver and placing
his clothes with his weapon and arrow-case upon his head he
went down to the river and swam it until he came forth it on the
further side. Here he walked up to the gateway and found an
impregnable entrance all of steel which none might avail to
open, but when he saw the verses thereon inscribed and understood
their significance he gave himself joy and was certified of
entering. Then he took from his quiver a pen case and paper
whereupon he inscribed these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“At your door, O Fountains of weal, I stand ✿ A stranger from home and a-morning bann’d.</div>
      <div class="line">Your grace shall haply forfend my foe ✿ And the hateful band of unfriends disband:</div>
      <div class="line">I have none resort save your gates, the which ✿ With verse like carcanet see I spann’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Ibn Sahl hath ’spied with you safe repair, ✿ So for lonesome stranger approach command!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Yusuf had ended his writing, he folded the paper and
made it fast to a shaft; then he took his bow and arming it drew
the string and aimed the arrow at the upper terrace, where it
dropped within the parapet. Now, by the decree of The Decreer
Al-Hayfa was walking there with her women when the shaft fell
between her feet and the paper became manifest, so she caught
sight of it and took it up and opened it, and having read it
understood its significance. Hereat she rejoiced and congratulated
herself and her cheeks flushed rosy-red, and presently she went
hastily in the direction of the entrance, whilst her women still
looked down from the terrace upon the doorway and saw Yusuf
a-foot before it. They cried out to their lady, “Verily there
standeth below a youth lovely in his youthfulness, with his face
gladdening as the crescent moon of Sha’abán.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7304" id="noteref-7304" epub:type="noteref">7304</a> But when
Al-Hayfa heard the words of the women she was glad and gave
herself joy and sensed an oppression of pleasure, whilst her vitals
palpitated and she perspired in her petticoat trowsers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7305" id="noteref-7305" epub:type="noteref">7305</a> Then
she went down to the gateway which she bade be thrown open,
and seeing Prince Yusuf she smiled in his face and welcomed
him and greeted him. He returned her salam with sweetness of
phrase and softness of words, when said she to him, “Well come
and welcome and good cheer to thee, O thou who dost visit us
and takest refuge in our demesne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7306" id="noteref-7306" epub:type="noteref">7306</a> and in our presence, for that
here thou hast immunity and impunity and civility;” presently
adding, “Enter into this guarded stead and feel thou no fear
from any foe, for thou has wrought thy wish and hast attained
thine aim and hast won thy will, O fair of face and O perfect of
form, O thou whose countenance excelleth the new moon: here
thou hast preserved thy life and art saved from foeman’s strife.”
Thereupon she mounted the staircase and he behind her, while
the slave-girls surrounded the twain, and she conversed with him
and cheered him with fair words and welcomed him once more
till they had entered the Castle saloon, when she took his hand
and seated him at the head of the hall. But as Yusuf looked
upon the portalice and the beauty of its building and the
excellence of its ordinance and the high degree of its decorations
which made it like unto the Palaces of Paradise, and as he beheld
that furniture and those couches, with what was over them of
hangings, and the gems and jewels and precious metals which
abounded there, he magnified the matter in his mind and said to
himself, “This place belongeth to none save to a mighty monarch!”
Then Al-Hayfa bade her women bring a bundle of clothing, and
when they had set it between her hands, she opened it and drew
forth a suit of Daylakian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7307" id="noteref-7307" epub:type="noteref">7307</a> garments and a caftan of Coptick stuff
(fine linen of Misraim purfled with gold), and bestowed them
upon him, and she bound around his head an or-fringed Shásh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7308" id="noteref-7308" epub:type="noteref">7308</a>
with either end gem-adorned. And when he donned the dress
his countenance became brilliant and its light shone afar, and
his cheeks waxed red as rose, and she seeing this felt her wits
bewildered and was like to faint. However, she soon recovered
herself and said, “This is no mortal: verily he is naught but of
the Húrs of Heaven.” Then she bade her women bring food——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was
the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa bade
her women bring the food trays, and when they obeyed her bidding
and placed them between the hands of Yusuf, he considered
them and saw that one was made of Yamání onyx and another of
red carnelian and a third of rock chrystal, and they bore platters
of gold and silver and porcelain and jasper. Upon them were
ranged dishes furnished with the daintiest food which perplexed
the wits, and sweetmeats and sumptuous meats, such as gazelle’s
haunch and venison and fatted mutton and flesh of birds, all the big
and the small, such as pigeon and rock-pigeon, and greens marinated
and viands roasted and fried of every kind and colour and cheeses
and sugared dishes. Then she seated Yusuf beside her and
served him with all manner cates and confections and conjured
him to fall-to and morselled him until he had eaten his sufficiency;
after which they twain sat together in laughter and enjoyment
each conjoined to other and both cast in the mould of beauty
and loveliness and brilliancy and stature and symmetric grace as
though in the likeness of a rattan-palm. All this and Al-Hayfa
rejoiced in Yusuf, but ever and anon she took thought anent her
sire King Al-Mihrjan and his works and she kept saying in her
mind, “Would Heaven I wot will he wed me to this youth so
charming of inner grace; and, if my father be not satisfied therewith,
I will marry my lover in despite of him.” And the while Yusuf
quoth to himself, “Would Heaven I wot how my sire will act in
the business of the concubine whose pucelage I did away, and
would Heaven I knew if he have ridden forth in search of me, or
he have lost sight of me and never asked of me.” On this wise
either of the twain spoke to themselves, and neither of them believed
in safety, all unknowing what was predestined to them by Him
who saith to a thing, “Be” and it becometh. So Al-Hayfa and
Yusuf sat drowned in the depths of thought, withal their joyance
and enjoyment made them clean forget that writ for them by
Fate; and the Prince gazing upon the greater tray saw graven
upon its edge these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“For the gathering of friends and familiars design’d ✿ Between hands of Kings and Wazirs I’m shrin’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Upon me is whatever taste loves and joys ✿ Of flesh and viands all kinds combin’d:</div>
      <div class="line">From me fill thee full of these cates and praise ✿ Thy Lord, the Maker of all mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then the attendants placed bread upon the trays, and the Prince
found writ in moulded letters upon the loaves the couplets that
follow:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And a loaf new-born from the flour of wheat, ✿ White and piping hot from the oven-heat:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth to me my chider, Be wise and say ✿ Soothe my heart and blame not, O friend I greet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Presently the handmaidens piled upon the trays platters of silver
and porcelain (whereof mention hath been made) containing all
that lip and tongue gratify of the meat of muttons in fry and
Katá-grouse and pigeon-poults and quails and things that fly of
every kind and dye which hungry men can long to espy, and
Yusuf saw inscribed upon the china dishes the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Platters of china fair     ✿ That all men’s eyne ensnare,</div>
      <div class="line">None seeth in this our town ✿ China of mould so rare.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he looked upon the silver plate and found it graven with
these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Plate worked in silver of the brightest white ✿ In height of beauty, O thou joy to sight,</div>
      <div class="line">When fully finisht and when perfect made ✿ Becometh chargers peerless in delight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And portrayed upon the porcelain were all that grow and fly of
geese and poultry. Anon a handmaid brought in hand a knife
wherewith to carve the meats, and Yusuf looking at the blade
saw upon it letters gold-inlaid and forming these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am blade of finest grain     ✿ Wherefrom comes naught of bane:</div>
      <div class="line">Fro’ my friends all harm I ward ✿ And thy foes by me be slain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereupon the handmaids ended the ordinance of the table and
set everything in its own stead; after which the Princess took
seat beside the Prince and said to him, “O my lord, hearten our
heart and deign grace to us and honour us by eating with us:
this indeed be a day of joy for my union with thee and for thy
lighting this my lodging with the splendour of thy semblance so
bright and thy beauty so rare and for thine alighting at my home
and thine opportune kindness and thine inner graciousness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7309" id="noteref-7309" epub:type="noteref">7309</a> O thou
unique one of the Age and the Time, and O thou who hast no
peer in our day and our tide.” Now when Yusuf heard the words
of Al-Hayfa he said to her, “Walláhi, O thou who the moons
adornest and who the sun and the daylight shamest, O lady of
brow flower-bright and of stature elegant-slight, O thou who
passest in beauty and comeliness all mortal beings, O thou with
smile like water sweet and mouth-dews like purest spring and of
speech the softest, I wot thou art the lady of goodness and excellence
and generosity and liberality.” Then she again fell to
morselling the Prince until they both had a sufficiency of food,
whereupon she bade them fetch water for washing their hands
after meat. And they brought to Yusuf a basin of glittering gold,
when he rejoiced with exceeding exultation the while he was sunk
in meditation, and at times he gazed upon Al-Hayfa and his wits
were bewildered and his senses seduced him to something he would
do with her for the abundance that was in her of beauty and
loveliness. But his reason forbade to him his passion, and quoth
he in his mind, “To everything its own time,”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to
say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Yusuf said,
“To everything its own time, and soothly sayeth the old saw,
Whoso hurrieth upon a matter ere opportunity consent shall at last
repent.” Now when they brought the basin before him and therein
stood an ewer of chrystal garnished with gold, he looked at it and
saw graven thereupon the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I’m a Basin gold beautifies ✿ For the hands of the great and the wise:</div>
      <div class="line">Abased<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7310" id="noteref-7310" epub:type="noteref">7310</a> for the cleansing of palms, ✿ Washing hands with the water of eyes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereat he considered the ewer and saw inscribed upon it these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O rare the Ewer’s form whereon must dote ✿ Our hearts and pupils of our eyes fain gloat:</div>
      <div class="line">Seems ferly fair to all admiring orbs ✿ You seemly body wi’ the slender throat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he had finished washing his hands and had dried them
with the napkins he pointed at them and spoke these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Groweth my love a-heart and how to hide ✿ When o’er the plains of cheek tear-torrents glide?</div>
      <div class="line">I veil what love these sobs and moans betray ✿ With narrowed heart I spread my patience wide.</div>
      <div class="line">O Farer to the fountain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7311" id="noteref-7311" epub:type="noteref">7311</a> flow these eyes ✿ Nor seek from other source to be supplied:</div>
      <div class="line">Who loveth, veil of Love his force shall reave, ✿ For tears shall tell his secrets unespied:</div>
      <div class="line">I for the love of you ain bye-word grown, ✿ My lords, and driven to the Desert-side;</div>
      <div class="line">While you in heart of me are homed, your home; ✿ And the heart-dweller kens what there may bide.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Prince Yusuf had finished his improvisation and the poetry
which he produced, Princess Al-Hayfa bussed him upon the brow,
and he seeing this waxed dazed of his wits and right judgment
fled him and he fell fainting to the floor for a while of time. And
when he came to himself he pondered how she had entreated him
and his Passion would have persuaded him to do with her somewhat
but Reason forbad and with her force he overcame himself.
After his improvising Al-Hayfa again saluted him on the front and
cried, “Indeed thou hast done well in thy words, O thou with
Crescent’s brow!” Presently she came for the table of wine and
filling a cup drank it off; then she crowned another goblet and
passed it to Yusuf who took it and kissed it while she improvised
some couplets as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thy seduction of lips ne’er can I forbear ✿ Nor deny love-confession for charms so rare:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou aim of my eyes, how my longing stay? ✿ O thou tall of form and long wavy hair?</div>
      <div class="line">Thy rose-hued cheek showeth writ new-writ<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7312" id="noteref-7312" epub:type="noteref">7312</a> ✿ Dimming wine my cups in thei rondure bear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And presently she added:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7313" id="noteref-7313" epub:type="noteref">7313</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I hid his phantom, by the Lord, but showed ✿ My looks the blush his scented cheek had sent:</div>
      <div class="line">How veil the joy his love bestows, when I ✿ To blood-red<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7314" id="noteref-7314" epub:type="noteref">7314</a> tears on cheek give open vent,</div>
      <div class="line">When his uplighted cheek my heart enfires ✿ As though a-morn in flame my heart were pent?</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, ne’er my love for you I’ll change ✿ Though change my body and to change consent.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Al-Hayfa had finished her improvisation and her
poetry, Yusuf drained the goblet and after kissing it returned it to
her; but he was as one a-swoon. Then she took it from him and
he recovered and presently declaimed for her the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“A maiden in your tribe avails my heart with love to fire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7315" id="noteref-7315" epub:type="noteref">7315</a> ✿ And how can I a hidden bear the love my eyes declare?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As soon as Yusuf had finished his improvisation and what of
poetry he had produced, Al-Hayfa took seat by his side and fell
to conversing with him in sweetest words with softest smiles, the
while saying, “Fair welcome to thee, O wonder of beauty and
lovesome in eloquence and Oh charming in riant semblance and
lord of high degree and clear nobility: thou hast indeed illumined
our place with the light of thy flower-like forehead and to our
hearts joyance hast thou given and our cares afar hast thou driven
and eke our breasts hast made broad; and this is a day of festival
to laud, so do thou solace our souls and drain of our wine with us
for thou art the bourne and end and aim of our intent.” Then
Al-Hayfa took a cup of chrystal, and crowning it with clear-strained
wine which had been sealed with musk and saffron, she passed it
to Prince Yusuf. He accepted it from her albeit his hand trembled
from what befel him of her beauty and the sweetness of her poetry
and her perfection; after which he began to improvise these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou who drainest thy morning wine ✿ With friends in a bower sweet blooms enshrine—</div>
      <div class="line">Place unlike all seen by sight of man ✿ In the lands and gardens of best design——,</div>
      <div class="line">Take gladly the liquor that quivers in cup ✿ And elevates man, this clean Maid of the Vine:</div>
      <div class="line">This goblet bright that goes round the room ✿ Nor Chosroës held neither Nu’uman’s line.</div>
      <div class="line">Drink amid sweet flowers and myrtle’s scent ✿ Orange-bloom and Lily and Eglantine,</div>
      <div class="line">And Rose and Apple whose cheek is dight ✿ In days that glow with a fiery shine;</div>
      <div class="line">’Mid the music of strings and musician’s gear ✿ Where harp and pipe with the lute combine;—</div>
      <div class="line">An I fail to find her right soon shall I ✿ Of parting perish foredeemed to die!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Al-Hayfa responded to him in the same rhyme and measure
and spake to him as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou who dealest in written line ✿ Whose nature hiding shall e’er decline;</div>
      <div class="line">And subdued by wine in its mainest might ✿ Like lover drunken by strains divine,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7316" id="noteref-7316" epub:type="noteref">7316</a></div>
      <div class="line">Do thou gaze on our garden of goodly gifts ✿ And all manner blooms that in wreaths entwine;</div>
      <div class="line">See the birdies warble on every bough ✿ Make melodious music the finest fine.</div>
      <div class="line">And each Pippet pipes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7317" id="noteref-7317" epub:type="noteref">7317</a> and each Curlew cries ✿ And Blackbird and Turtle with voice of pine;</div>
      <div class="line">Ring-dove and Culver, and eke Hazár, ✿ And Katá calling on Quail vicine;</div>
      <div class="line">So fill with the mere and the cups make bright ✿ With bestest liquor, that boon benign;—</div>
      <div class="line">This site and sources and scents I espy ✿ With Rizwán’s garden compare defy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Al-Hayfa had ended her improvisation and what she
had spoken to him of poetry, and Yusuf had given ear to the
last couplet, he was dazed and amazed and he shrieked aloud and
waxed distraught for her and for the women that were beside
and about her, and after the cry he fell fainting to the ground.
But in an hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7318" id="noteref-7318" epub:type="noteref">7318</a> he came to, when the evening evened and the
wax candles and the chandeliers were lighted, his desire grew
and his patience flew and he would have risen to his feet and
wandered in his craze but he found no force in his knees. So
he feared for himself and he remained sitting as before.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Yusuf remained
sitting as before, Al-Hayfa asked him saying, “How art thou
hight, O dearling of my heart and fruit of my vitals?” Hereupon
he told her his name and the name of his sire, and related
to her the whole of what had befallen him, first and last, with the
affair of the concubine and his faring forth from his own city and
how he had sighted her Palace and had swum the stream and shot
the shaft that carried the paper, after which he recited to her
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I left my home for a fair young maid ✿ Whose love my night with its light array’d;</div>
      <div class="line">Yet wot I not what her name may be ✿ Thus ignorance mating with union forbade.</div>
      <div class="line">But when of her gifts I was certified ✿ Her gracious form the feat easy made;</div>
      <div class="line">The King of Awe sent my steps to her ✿ And to union with beauty vouchsafed me aid:</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed disgrace ever works me shame ✿ Tho’ long my longing to meet I’m afraid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Al-Hayfa heard his name her great love to him waxed
greater. Then she took the lute upon her lap and caressed it with
her finger-tips when it sighed and sobbed and groaned and moaned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7319" id="noteref-7319" epub:type="noteref">7319</a>
and she fell to singing these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“A thousand welcomes hail thy coming fain, ✿ O Yúsuf, dearling son of Sahl’s strain:</div>
      <div class="line">We read thy letter and we understood ✿ Thy kingly birth from sand that told it plain:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7320" id="noteref-7320" epub:type="noteref">7320</a></div>
      <div class="line">I’m thine, by Allah, I the loveliest maid ✿ Of folk and thou to be my husband deign:</div>
      <div class="line">Bruit of his fair soft cheek my love hath won ✿ And branch and root his beauty grows amain:</div>
      <div class="line">He from the Northern Realms to us draws nigh ✿ For King Mihrján bequeathing ban and bane;</div>
      <div class="line">And I behold him first my Castle seek ✿ As mate impelled by inspiration fain.</div>
      <div class="line">The land upstirs he and the reign he rules ✿ From East to West, the King my father slain;</div>
      <div class="line">But first he flies us for no fault of ours ✿ Upon us wasting senseless words and vain:</div>
      <div class="line">E’en so Creation’s Lord hath deigned decree, ✿ Unique in Heaven—glorified be He!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7321" id="noteref-7321" epub:type="noteref">7321</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Yusuf heard the words of Al-Hayfa he rejoiced with
exceeding joy and she was gladdened in like manner, after which
he gifted her with all that was upon him of gear and in similar
guise she doffed what dress was upon her and presented it to him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7322" id="noteref-7322" epub:type="noteref">7322</a>
Then she bade the slave girls bring her an especial suit and they
fetched her a second bundle and she clothed Yusuf with what was
therein of sumptuous clothes. After this the Prince abode with
Al-Hayfa as an inmate of her palace for a term of ten days in all
the happiness of life, eating and drinking and enjoying conjugal
intercourse.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7323" id="noteref-7323" epub:type="noteref">7323</a> Presently Almighty Allah (be He extolled and
exalted!) decreed that, when all tidings of Yusuf son of Sahl
were lost, his sire sent in search of him Yahyà,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7324" id="noteref-7324" epub:type="noteref">7324</a> his cousin and the
son of his maternal aunt, amongst a troop of twenty knights to
track his trail and be taught his tidings until Allah (be He
glorified and magnified!) guided him to the pages who had been
left upon the river-bank. Here they had tarried for ten days
whilst the sunshine burnt them and hunger was exterminating
them; and when they were asked concerning their lord, they gave
notice that he had swum the stream and had gone up to yonder
Castle and had entered therein. “And we know not (they ended)
whether he be alive or dead.” So the lord Yahya said to them,
“Is there amongst you any will cross the current and bring us
news of him?” but not one of them would consent and they
remained in silence and confusion. So he asked them a second
time and a third time yet none would rise up before him and
hearten him to attempt the dangers of the stream, whereupon he
drew forth his ink case of brass and a sheet of paper and he fell
to writing the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“This day I have witnessed a singular case ✿ Of Yúsuf scion to Sahl’s dear race:</div>
      <div class="line">Since he fared at undurn his sire was grieved ✿ And the Palace remained but an empty place:</div>
      <div class="line">I liken the youth to full moon ’mid stars ✿ Disappearing and darkening Earth’s bright face.</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis my only fear that his heart is harmed, ✿ Brent by Love-fires lacking of mercy and grace:</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, albeit man’s soul thou rule ✿ Among stranger folk thou art but an ace!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Presently he took a reed and grasping it thrust thereinto the
twisted and folded paper, after which he stopped the hole with
wax; then, lashing it to the surface of the shaft, he set it upon the
bow-handle and drew the string and shot the bolt in the direction
of the Castle, whither it flew and fell at the foot of the staircase
beside the main entrance. It so fortuned at that time a slave-girl
came forth to fill her pitcher with water and she found the
arrow and picked it up and carried it to her lady who was sitting
in the speak-room at converse with Yusuf. Hereupon the Prince
hent the reed in hand and broke it and drew forth the paper which
he opened and read and comprehended. Hereupon he wept with
exceeding great weeping until he fell to the floor a-faint and the
Princess took the note from his grasp and perused it, and it was
hard upon her, so she bade them beat the slave-girl who brought
the writ with an hundred blows and they bastinadoed her till
she lost her senses. But when Yusuf recovered, he thought of his
pages and his people and his homestead and his family and he
cried to Al-Hayfa, “Wallahi, I have sinned with a great sin when
I left my suite in the desert; and Satan garred me forget them
and the wine made me mindless of them and banished from my
thought my folk and my home. And now ’tis my desire to fare
and look upon my pages and to forgather with Yahya my cousin,
the son of the King’s sister and greet them and dismiss them to their
homesteads, after which I will return to thee forthright.” Quoth
she, “By Allah, I may not patient myself away from thee a single
hour otherwise shall my spirit depart my body, and I conjure thee
by the Almighty that thou bid me return to them a reply!”
Quoth Prince Yusuf, “What news wilt thou give them? An thou
say that I never came to thee none will believe; for indeed my
pages saw me passing into thy Palace”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince
Yusuf said to the Princess Al-Hayfa, “Indeed my pages saw me
passing into the Palace and have given him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7325" id="noteref-7325" epub:type="noteref">7325</a> tidings to that effect.”
And she responded to him with fairest response and tenderness of
terms and gem-like verse. Then she took her ink-case and paper
and a brazen pen and would have written but he forbade her, saying
by way of deprecation, “This be not the right rede! An thou
return a reply my slaves will take it and will bear it to my native
country and will inform the folk of all our adventure: ’tis better
far that I fare to them myself and greet them and going with them
to my own country satisfy my sire, after which I will return to thee
in hottest haste. And do not thou on this wise, for we fear lest
our affair be made public and this our case be reported to thy royal
father, and it prove hard to him by reason that all such talk in the
case of the Kings is to them mighty grievous. Moreover, when he
shall be acquainted with the truth he will either transport thee to
his presence or he shall place over this Palace guards who may
forbid thee from me and forbid me from thee, and this shall be a
cause of our separation each from other.” But Al-Hayfa shrieked
aloud when she heard these words and wept and wailing said, “O
my lord, prithee take me with thee, me and my handmaids and all
that be in this my Palace.” Said he, “I will not delay from thee
save for the space of my wayfare an I live and Allah Almighty
preserve me.” Hereat she wept with loud weeping and groaned,
and love-longing surged up in her and she fell to repeating the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Rain, O mine eyeballs, gouts of blood beshed ✿ From clouds of eyelids e’en as grass turns red.</div>
      <div class="line">O mighty bane that beatest on my bones ✿ And oh heart-core, that melts with fire long-fed!</div>
      <div class="line">My soul’s own dearling speedeth on his march ✿ Who can be patient when his true love sped?</div>
      <div class="line">Deal kindly with my heart, have ruth, return ✿ Soon to my Castle nor be long misled.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Al-Hayfa had ended her verse, Yusuf wept with sore
weeping and cried, “By Allah, I had intended to return to thee
after I had fared to them and had settled the matter in hand. But
suffer me dismiss those who have come for me and seek reunion with
thee, Inshallah—an it be the will of Allah Almighty.” Then he
farewelled her and doffed what he had of dress, and when Al-Hayfa
asked him, “Wherefore take off these clothes?” he answered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7326" id="noteref-7326" epub:type="noteref">7326</a> “I
will not inform anyone of our news, and indeed this dress mostly
befitteth womenkind.” Then he went forth from her with a grief-bound
heart and she wept and cried, “Help! Help!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7327" id="noteref-7327" epub:type="noteref">7327</a> and all
her women shrieked and shed tears over parting with him. But
as soon as Yusuf passed out of the palace-door he took off the
gown which was upon him and turband’d it around his head
together with his bow and quiver, and he stinted not to stem the
stream until he had reached the further bank where he found and
greeted the lord Yahya and his Mamelukes. They all kissed his
hand, and his cousin enquired of him, “What is the cause of thy
disappearing from these thy men for a space of ten days?” He
replied, “By Allah, O son of my aunt, when I went up to yonder
Palace, I found there a Youth of the sons of the kings, who welcomed
and greeted me as a guest and honoured me with the
highmost honour and favoured me with the fullest favour. But
when I would have taken leave of him, the air smote me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7328" id="noteref-7328" epub:type="noteref">7328</a> and fell
upon my loins and laid me up so that I feared to swim the stream
and the unease that was upon me increased, and such is the reason
of my delaying away from you.” Then he took horse together
with Yahya and the pages, and they all sought their homes and
cut across the wilds and the wastes and the vales and the
stony hills until they drew near to their destination and their city
rose clear before eyes of them. As soon as they reached it the tidings
were told to King Sahl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7329" id="noteref-7329" epub:type="noteref">7329</a> who made ready for faring forth, he and
the lords of his land, to meet and greet his son and heir Yusuf;
and meanwhile he bade decorate the capital with the choicest
decorations and ornaments and adornments. The lieges gave one
another joy of their Prince’s safe return, and clothed their city in
gala-guise, and the father having met the son alighted from his
steed and embraced him and kissed him between the eyes, and
personally conducting him up to the Palace did him due honour
and largessed him; and so great and lasting was their joy that the
day of arrival became high holiday. As soon as night fell, Prince
Yusuf repaired to his own Palace where he was met by his mother
and his women who were as full moons a-rising; and the spouses
numbered three, besides forty concubines. However he turned
away from them and he lay alone that night moaning even as
moaneth the dove for the loss of her mate; and he regarded not
one of those wives and lemans, and he passed the dark hours in
brooding over the loss of his beloved, and in weeping and in the
reciting of poetry,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Yusuf passed
the night weeping and improvising verse, but he let not fall a word
of explanation fearing lest he divulge his secret; and his spouses
supposed that he was wroth with his sire and knew not what there
was in his vitals of exceeding desire to Al-Hayfa. But when
brake the day he was roused and gazing upon the rise of awaking
Dawn he pondered the happy mornings which had passed; so he
wept and complained and moaned like the culver and he fell to
reciting these couplets:——</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“No joy but you in house and home I know ✿ Save bitter heart and tears that ever flow;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor with mine eyes I view aught save yourselves ✿ Whenas in lowe of love-desire I glow:</div>
      <div class="line">My heart enjoys but gust and greed for you, ✿ Mine eyelids own no joy save wake and woe:</div>
      <div class="line">O blaming me for them, avaunt, by God ✿ Nor leave me fancy-free, worst gift of foe!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Yusuf has finished his poetry he fell into a fainting fit
and he quivered as quivereth the fowl with cut throat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7330" id="noteref-7330" epub:type="noteref">7330</a> and he came
not to himself save when the sun had arisen arraying the lowlands
with its rays. Then he waxed wood and sat with eyes at the ground,
a-gazing and not accosting anyone nor answering aught, and lastly
he took to his pillow. These tidings presently reached the King
his father, who accompanied by the Lords of his land came to him
and after greeting him said, “O my son, whom I would ransom
with my life, what contagion hath come upon thee of disease,
and whereof dost thou complain?” Quoth he, “O my father, the
air hath struck me and hath cut my joints,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7331" id="noteref-7331" epub:type="noteref">7331</a> and quoth his father,
“O my son, Almighty Allah vouchsafe ease thee of this thy
disease.” Then the King mounted and went forth from him, and
sent a leach which was a Jew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7332" id="noteref-7332" epub:type="noteref">7332</a> of wits penetrating and sagacious.
The man went in to him, and sitting beside him felt his joints and
asked him of his case; but he held his peace nor would return
aught of reply. So the Israelite knew that he was a lover and in
the depths of love bedrowned; accordingly he left him and told the
King that the Prince had no complaint save that he was a hot
amourist and distraught of vitals. Hereupon his mother came to
Yusuf and said, “O my son, fear Almighty Allah for thy soul, and
have some regard for thy wives and concubines and yield not to
thy passions which will mislead thee from the path of Allah.”
But he deigned not answer her. In this condition he remained
until three days sped, taking no taste of meat or drink, nor finding
pleasure in any stead, nor aught of rest a-bed. Presently he bade
summon a Mameluke of the Mamelukes Hilál hight, and asked
him, “O Hilal, say me wilt thou be my companion in travel?”
whereto the other answered, “Yea, verily, O my lord, to hear is
to obey thee in all thou devisest and desirest.” Hereupon the
Prince bade him saddle a steed of the purest blood, whose name
was “<em>The-Bull-aye-ready-and-for-Battle-day-steady</em>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7333" id="noteref-7333" epub:type="noteref">7333</a> a beast which
was a bye-word amongst the folk. The Prince waited until the
first third of the night had gone by when he mounted the courser
and placed Hilal his Mameluke upon the crupper, and they cut
once more the wilds and the wastes until they sighted hard-by the
river Al-Kawa’ib and the Castle of Al-Hayfa rising from its waters.
Hereupon Yusuf fell to the ground in a swoon, and he when he
recovered said to Hilal, “Do thou ungirth the horse’s saddle and
hide it within the cave amid the rocks;” and the Mameluke did as
he was bidden and returned to him. Herewith Prince Yusuf turband’d
himself with his clothes and those of his man, and backing
the horse bade Hilal hang on by its tail, then the beast breasted
the stream and ceased not swimming with them until it reached
the farther side. There Yusuf dismounted and knocked at the door
when a confidential handmaid established in the good graces of her
mistress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7334" id="noteref-7334" epub:type="noteref">7334</a> came down and threw it open, after which she embraced
him and kissed his hands and his breast and his brow between the
eyes. Then she ran up and informed thereof her lady who with
wits bedazed for excess of joy hurried down to him and threw her
arms round his neck, and he threw his arms round hers, and she
clasped him to her bosom, and he clasped her to his, and he kissed
her and she kissed him, and they exchanged accolades, after which
they both of them fell fainting to the floor until the women who
stood by thought that they had been reaped by Death, and that
their latest hour had been doomed. But when they recovered
from their swoon they complained and wept, each lamenting to
other the pains of parting, and lastly she asked him concerning
Hilal, and he answered, “This is a Mameluke of the number of my
Mamelukes.” So she marvelled how two men had come upon one
horse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7335" id="noteref-7335" epub:type="noteref">7335</a> and quoth she to him, “O Yusuf, thou hast indeed tortured
me with thine absence;” and quoth he to her, “By Allah (and
beside Him God there is none!) my hand never touched or woman
or aught of feminine kind or of she-Jinn or Jinn kind, but in
me desire for thee ever surged up, and wake and in vitals a fiery
ache.” Then the Princess bade her handmaids wend with Hilal in
a body to the garden, and when they obeyed her bidding she arose
and walked forth with Yusuf.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting, and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa
walked forth with Yusuf and led him to the saloon of session where
they passed their day in privacy, he and she, and right joyous was
the joy of them twain. After this the Prince abode with her thirty
full-told days in merriment prime and pleasure and wine. But
when that time had elapsed, she said to him, “O light of my eyes,
do thou arise and go up with me to the highmost post of the
Palace that we may look upon this flow of stream and command
a view of these mounts and mountains and these wilds and valleys
wherein wander the gazelles.” Thereupon the twain fared together
and solaced themselves with the spectacle of the antelopes browsing
on the desert growth, when quoth Al-Hayfa, “Ah, O my lord,
would I had for captive one of these herding roes to keep
beside me in the Palace,” and quoth he, “By the rights of thine
eyes, and the night of their pupils, I indeed will fill the place with
them.” Hereupon he went forth from her in haste, albeit she hung
on to him and forbade him from that, and she invoked upon herself
a mighty strong invocation, yet would he not be stayed, but taking
his horse and saddling it he left his Mameluke Hilal in the Castle
and swam the stream upon his steed, and rode through the wold in
quest of the gazelles. He ceased not chasing them till he had
taken three,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7336" id="noteref-7336" epub:type="noteref">7336</a> which he tied fast and slung upon his courser and rode
back until he had reached the river-bank, and Al-Hayfa sat looking
at him as he pounced upon and snatched up the roes from his
courser’s back like a lion and she wondered with extreme wonderment.
But when he had made sure of his place on the water-side
and purposed returning to the palace, lo and behold! he saw a
batel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7337" id="noteref-7337" epub:type="noteref">7337</a> manned by sundry men coming towards him down-stream
from the direction of his capital. Now Al-Hayfa, who was in her
bower, expected the craft to be sent, bearing rarities and presents,
by her sire King Al-Mihrjan; and Yusuf, when he looked upon
its approach, was certified that it came from her father. So he
delayed going down to the river till he had seen what action might
be taken by the batel, but when the Princess sighted it she made
sure of its coming from her sire, so she bade bring paper for note
and a pen of brass wrought wherewith she wrote in verse and lastly
indited to Yusuf these couplets:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my need, thou hast left me a-field to fare ✿ When come is a craft which our men doth bear:</div>
      <div class="line">I deem she be sent by Al-Mihrján ✿ And it bringeth of provaunt a goodly share:</div>
      <div class="line">So loiter a little, then back to us ✿ And obey my bidding, O Beauty rare.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7338" id="noteref-7338" epub:type="noteref">7338</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she made fast the paper to a shaft and setting it upon a
bow-handle drew the string aiming high in air, and the arrow fell
between the feet of the Prince, who seeing it took it up and read
the writ and comprehended its meaning and full significance.
So he hung back and he turned to wandering amongst the
mountains, but anon he said in himself, “There is no help but
that I discover this matter.” Then he dismounted from his steed
and stabled it in a cave hard-by, and having loosed the antelopes
he propped himself against a rock and fell to gazing upon the
batel, which ceased not floating down until it made fast at the
Palace gate. Hereupon there issued from it a youth, singular of
comeliness, whom Al-Hayfa greeted and embraced, and forthright
led within her Palace. Presently came forth from the batel
the four pages that were therein, and amongst them was a man
hight Mohammed ibn Ibráhím, one of the King’s cup-companions,
whereas the youth she had embraced was her cousin, named
Sahlúb, the son of her maternal aunt. But when Yusuf looked
upon this lover-like reception, his wits were wildered and the
sparks started from his eyes, and he deprecated and waxed
care-full and indeed he was like one Jinn-mad, and he cried,
“Walláhi, I will stay away from them this night and see whatso
they do.” Now Al-Hayfa had left her trusty handmaid at the
Palace gate, saying to her, “Tarry here alone: haply Yusuf shall
return during the dark hours, when do thou open to him the
door.” Then she returned to her guests and bade serve the table
of wine and seated Sahlub and Ibn Ibrahim, and took seat
between them after she had hidden the Mameluke Hilal in a
closet and she had disposed of the pages about the Palace-sides.
Then they fell to drinking wine. Such was the case with these;
but as regards Yusuf, he took patience until the dark hours drew
near, when he swam the stream and he came forth it to the Palace-door,
at which he knocked a light knock. Hereupon the porter-handmaiden
opened to him and he accosted her and questioned
her concerning her lady, and was told that she was sitting with
her cousin and the prime favourite and cup-companion of her
sire. So quoth he to the girl, “Say me, canst thou place me in
some commanding place that I may look upon them?” and she
did accordingly, choosing a site whence he might spy them
without being espied. He gazed at them as one distraught,
while Al-Hayfa engaged them in converse and improvised verse
to them; and this was so distressful to him that at last he asked
the slave-girl, “Say me, hast thou by thee ink-case and paper?”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating,
that Prince Yusuf took from the handmaid the pen case and
paper, and waxing void of sense through jealousy, fell to writing
the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed I deemed you of memory true ✿ And our hearts as one that had once been two;</div>
      <div class="line">But I found to my sorrow you kept no pact: ✿ This much and you fain of unfaith I view.</div>
      <div class="line">Ill eye ne’er looketh on aught but love ✿ Save when the lover is hater too.</div>
      <div class="line">You now to another than us incline ✿ And leave us and homeward path pursue;</div>
      <div class="line">And if such doings you dare gainsay, ✿ I can summon witness convicting you;</div>
      <div class="line">To the Lion, wild dogs from the fount shall drive ✿ And shall drink themselves, is none honour due.</div>
      <div class="line">That I’m not of those who a portion take ✿ In love, O Moslems, I know ye knew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This done, he folded the paper and gave it to the slave-girl
crying, “Say me, dost thou know where be Hilal?” and as she
replied “Yes,” he told her to fetch him. So she went and brought
him, and when he came his lord dismissed the girl on some
pretext; then he opened the Castle-door and turband’d himself
with his gear and that of his Mameluke, and the twain went
down to the river and swam the stream until they reached the
other side. When they stood on terra firma, the Prince found
his horse and saddled and mounted him, taking Hilal upon the
crupper, and rode forth to his own country. Such was the case
with Yusuf; but as regards Al-Hayfa, when she awoke a-morn,
she asked of her lover and her handmaid handed to her the
letter; so she took it and read it and mastered its meaning and
significance, after which she wept with excessive weeping until
she fainted and the blood issued from her eyes. Presently she
came to herself and dismissed Sahlub and his companions; then
she said to Ibn Ibrahim, “Rise thou and depart our presence;
haply some wight may come to us and swim the stream and pass
into the Palace.” But Ibn Ibrahim remained behind while
Sahlub departed with those about him; and when they had left
the company, Al-Hayfa asked, “O Ibn Ibrahim, say me, canst
thou keep my secret and my being fascinate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7339" id="noteref-7339" epub:type="noteref">7339</a> by love?” and he
answered, “Yea, verily, O my lady, how should I not conceal
it for thee, when thou art my mistress and princess and the
daughter of my master, even though I keep it inside mine eyes?”
So she continued, “O Ibn Ibrahim, there came to me a youth
named the Veiled Yusuf of Beauty, son of King Sahl, Sovran
of Sind; and I waxed enamoured of him and he waxed enamoured
of me, and he abode with me two score of days. One day of
the days, quoth I to him:—Come up with me to the Palace-roof
that we may gaze upon the view, when we saw from its height
a herd of gazelles, and I cried:—Ah that I had one of these!
Hereat said he, By Allah, and by the life of thine eyes and by
the blackness of their pupils, I will in very deed fill thy Palace
therewith; and with such words he went forth and saddled his
steed and swam the river to the further side, where he rode down
three roes within sight of me. Then I looked city-ward up stream
and saw a batel cleaving the waters, whereby I knew that my
father had sent me somewhat therein; so I wrote to the Prince
and shot the paper bound to a shaft and bade him hide away
from your faces until ye should have departed. So he concealed
himself within a cave where he tethered his horse, then he sought
tidings of me, and seeing my cousin Sahlub, he was seized by
jealousy. So he lingered till yesternight, when he again swam
the stream and came to the Palace where I had posted Rádih,
the handmaid, bidding her take seat beside the door lest haply
he should enter; and presently she opened to him and he sought
a place commanding a sight of us, and he saw me sitting with
you twain, and both of you were carousing over your wine. Now
this was sore to him; so he wrote to me yonder note, and taking
his Mameluke with him, fared forth to his own folk; and my
desire is that you hie to him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7340" id="noteref-7340" epub:type="noteref">7340</a>——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy
story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to
you on the coming night, an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth Al-Hayfa
to Ibn Ibrahim, “I devise that thou hie to Yusuf with this letter;”
whereto quoth he, “Hearkening is obedience: I will, however,
take this thy writ and wend with it first to my own folk, after
which I will mount my horse and fare to find him.” So she
largessed him with an hundred gold pieces and entrusted to him
the paper which contained the following purport in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“What state of heart be this no ruth can hoard? ✿ And harm a wretch to whom none aid accord,</div>
      <div class="line">But sobs and singulfs, clouds that rain with tears ✿ And seas aye flowing and with gore outpour’d;</div>
      <div class="line">And flames that rage in vitals sickness-burnt ✿ The while in heart-core I enfold them stor’d.</div>
      <div class="line">Yet will I hearten heart with thee, O aim! ✿ O Ravisher, O Moslems’ bane ador’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Ne’er did I look for parting but ’twas doomed ✿ By God Almighty of all the lords the Lord.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Mohammed Ibn Ibrahim took the paper and Al-Hayfa said
to him, “Ho thou! Inform none that thou wast sitting beside me
on that night.” Then he went forth until he drew near his folk
and there he mounted a she-dromedary and pushed her pace until
he arrived at the capital of Sind. He asked for the son of the
King; and when they had directed him thereto he entered and
found the Prince in privacy; so he kissed hands and gave him the
writ which he took and opened and read. But when he had
comprehended its object and purport, he turned and returned it
with stern regards until he had well nigh torn it to tatters. Then
he threw it to Ibn Ibrahim who said to him, “O lord of the Time
and the Tide, ’tis not on this wise that the sons of the Kings cast
away an address without returning aught of reply.” Quoth he,
“There is no response from me,” and quoth Ibn Ibrahim, “O
King of the Age, pity that thou mayest be pitied!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7341" id="noteref-7341" epub:type="noteref">7341</a> Hereupon
the Prince called for pen-case and paper of note and pen of
brass wrought<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7342" id="noteref-7342" epub:type="noteref">7342</a> and wrote in reply to her poetry the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Al-Hayfá with verses a-tip of tongue ✿ Comes suing mercy for love so strong:</div>
      <div class="line">She hath no mercy fro’ me, but still ✿ She pleadeth a plea that our love was long:</div>
      <div class="line">She falsed, turned face, doubted, recked her naught ✿ And her hard false heart wrought me traitor’s wrong:</div>
      <div class="line">Were my heart now changèd her love to woo ✿ She with quick despisal my heart had stung:</div>
      <div class="line">Were my eyne to eye her, she’d pluck them out ✿ With tip of fingers before the throng:</div>
      <div class="line">Soft and tranquil life for her term she seeks ✿ While with hardness and harshness our souls are wrung.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Yusuf folded the paper and handed it to Ibn Ibrahim and
ordered him a robe of honour and an hundred dinars. So he
took them and rode forth until he drew near the Palace of Al-Hayfa,
when he tethered his dromedary and hid her in a cave
whose mouth he walled with stones. Then he went down to the
river and swam it till he reached the other side; and entering
into the presence of Al-Hayfa he drew forth the paper and committed
it to her. But she, after perusing it, wept with sore
weeping and groaned until she swooned away for excess of tears
and for the stress of what had befallen her. Such was the effect
of what she had read in the letter, and she knew not what might
be the issue of all this affair and she was perplext as one drunken
without wine. But when she recovered she called for pen-case and
paper, and she wrote these improvised couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Lord of folk, in our age alone ✿ And O Raper of hearts from the bonny and boon:</div>
      <div class="line">I have sent to thee ’plaining of Love’s hard works ✿ And my plaint had softened the hardest stone:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art silent all of my need in love ✿ And with shafts of contempt left me prone and strown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And after she had ended writing she folded her note and gave it
to Ibn Ibrahim who took it, and cried to his slaves, “Saddle my
she-dromedary,” after which he mounted and fared until he had
made the city of Sind. Then he repaired to Yusuf and after
greetings handed the letter to him, but the Prince after perusing
it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7343" id="noteref-7343" epub:type="noteref">7343</a> threw it in his face, and presently rose and would have left
him. But Ibn Ibrahim followed him and heard him say to his
pages, “Send him back without beating him,” and they did
accordingly, after forbidding him the place. So he again bestrode
his she-camel and ceased not pushing on till he arrived at the
Palace of Al-Hayfa where he presented himself in her presence.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7344" id="noteref-7344" epub:type="noteref">7344</a>
But when he handed to her the writ she found it was that very
same she had sent to the Prince, so she wept and sorrow was sore
upon her and presently she cried, “O Ibn Ibrahim! what’s to
do?” He replied, “When I delivered thy writ to him, he brake
its seal and read it and threw it in my face: then he rose in wrath
from beside me, and as I followed he bade his slaves and pages
drive me away, adding:—I have for her nor answer nor address;
and this was all he did.” When the Princess heard his words,
she felt the matter to be grievous, and she wept unknowing how
she should act, and fainted for awhile, and when she recovered
she said, “O Ibn Ibrahim, what is this affair and on what wise
shall I behave? Do thou advise me in my case; and haply joy
shall come to me from thy hand, for that thou be a Counsellor of
the Kings and their boon-companion.” “O my lady,” he replied,
“do thou not cut off thy tidings from him and haply shall
Almighty Allah change his heart from case to case and peradventure
insistance overcometh hindrance.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7345" id="noteref-7345" epub:type="noteref">7345</a> Quoth she, “Had
he sent me a reply I had been rightly directed as to what
I should write, but now I wot not what to indite, and if
this condition long endure I shall die.” “Address him again,”
answered he, “and I will fare back once more and fain would
I ransom thee with my life, nor will I return without a
reply.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ibn Ibrahim
said to Al-Hayfa, “Do thou write to him and there is no help but
that I return to thee with a reply, albe life depart from me.”
Then she asked for pen-case and paper and thereon indited the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ah would thou knew what I of parting dree ✿ When all my hiddens show for man to see;</div>

      <div class="line">Then, O my lord, an come thou not right soon ✿ The tomb shall home me for the love of thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when she had written her reply, she largessed Ibn Ibrahim
with an hundred dinars, after which he returned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7348" id="noteref-7348" epub:type="noteref">7348</a> to the capital of
Sind, where he found Yusuf issuing forth to hunt; so he handed
to him the letter, and the Prince returning citywards set apart for
him a fair apartment and spent the livelong night asking anent
Al-Hayfa. And when it was morning he called for pen-case and
paper whereupon he wrote these improvised couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“You dealt to us a slender dole our love mote satisfy, ✿ Yet nor my gratitude therefor nor laud of me shalt gain:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m none of those console their hearts by couplets or by verse ✿ For breach of inner faith by one who liefly breaks the chain:</div>
      <div class="line">When so it fortunes she I love a partner gives to me ✿ I wone in single bliss and let my lover love again:</div>
      <div class="line">Take, then, what youth your soul desires; with him forgather, for ✿ I aim not at your inner gifts nor woo your charms I deign:</div>
      <div class="line">You set for me a mighty check of parting and ill-will ✿ In public fashion and a-morn you dealt me bale and bane:</div>
      <div class="line">Such deed is yours and ne’er shall it, by Allah satisfy ✿ A boy, a slave of Allah’s slaves who still to slave is fain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Prince Yusuf robed Ibn Ibrahim in a robe of green; and
giving him an hundred gold pieces, entrusted him with the letter
which he carried to Al-Hayfa and handed it to her. She brake
the seal and read it and considered its contents, whereupon she
wept with sore weeping which ended in her shrieking aloud; and
after she abode perplext as to her affair and for a time she found
no sweetness in meat and drink nor was sleep pleasant to her for
the stress of her love-longing to Yusuf. Also her nature tempted
her to cast herself headlong from the terrace of the Palace; but
Ibn Ibrahim forbade her saying, “Do thou write to him replies,
time after time; haply shall his heart be turned and he will return
unto thee.” So she again called for writing materials and indited
these couplets, which came from the very core of her heart:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou art homed in a heart nothing else shall invade; ✿ Save thy love and thyself naught shall stay in such stead;</div>
      <div class="line">O thou, whose brilliancy lights his brow, ✿ Shaped like sandhill-tree with his locks for shade,</div>
      <div class="line">Forbid Heaven my like to aught else incline ✿ Save you whose beauties none like display’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Art thou no amongst mortals a starless moon ✿ O beauty the dazzle of day hath array’d?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c017">These she committed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7349" id="noteref-7349" epub:type="noteref">7349</a> to Ibn Ibrahim who rode again on his route
and forgathered with Prince Yusuf and gave him the letter, whose
contents were grievous to him; so he took writing materials and
returned a reply in the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Cease then to carry missives others write, ✿ O Son of Ibrahim, shun silly plight:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m healed of longing for your land and I ✿ Those days forget and daysters lost to sight:</div>
      <div class="line">Let then Al-Hayfá learn from me I love ✿ Distance from her and furthest earthly site.</div>
      <div class="line">No good in loving when a rival shows ✿ E’en tho’ ’twere victual shared by other wight;</div>
      <div class="line">These modes and fashions never mind arride ✿ Save him unknowing of his requisite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he entrusted the writ to Ibn Ibrahim, after giving him an
hundred dinars, and he fared forth and ceased not faring till he
had reached the palace of the Princess. Presently he went in and
handed to her the writ, and as soon as she had read it, the contents
seemed to her sore and she wept until her vitals were torn with
sobs. After this she raised her hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7350" id="noteref-7350" epub:type="noteref">7350</a> heavenwards and invoked
Allah and humbled herself before him and said, “My God, O my
Lord, do Thou soften the heart of Yusuf ibn Sahl and turn him
mewards and afflict him with love of me even as thou hast
afflicted me with his love; for Thou to whatso Thou wishest canst
avail, O bestest of Rulers and O forcefullest of Aiders.” Anon
she fell to writing and indited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Love rules my bosom and a-morn doth moan ✿ The Voice, ah Love, who shows strength weakness grown!</div>
      <div class="line">His lashes’ rapier-blade hath rent my heart; ✿ That keen curved brand my me hath overthrown:</div>
      <div class="line">That freshest cheek-rose fills me with desire; ✿ Fair fall who plucketh yonder bloom new-blown!</div>
      <div class="line">Since love befel me for that youth did I ✿ Begin for charms of him my pride to own:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou my hope, I swear by Him did share ✿ Love and decreed thou shouldst in longing wone,</div>
      <div class="line">In so exceeding grief why sight I thee ✿ Jacob made Joseph by the loss of me?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She then handed the letter to Ibn Ibrahim, after giving him an
hundred dinars; and he returned forthright to the city of Sind
and, repairing to Yusuf, gave him the writ which he took and read.
Hereupon the Prince waxed sore sorrowful and said to himself, “By
Allah, indeed Al-Hayfa cleaveth to love.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince Yusuf
said, “By Allah, had Al-Hayfa any save myself she had not sent
me these letters; but the outgoings of the heart conciliate lovers
and correspond each with other.” Then he took writing materials
and after thinking awhile he improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou of stature fair with waist full slight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7351" id="noteref-7351" epub:type="noteref">7351</a> ✿ Surpassing sandhill-branch and reedlet light;</div>
      <div class="line">I deal in words and gems of speech that melt, ✿ By none ’mid all of mortal kind indite;</div>
      <div class="line">From my tribe’s lord, a lion rending foes ✿ Moon of Perfections and ’The Yusuf’ hight:</div>
      <div class="line">Homed in thy home I joyed my joys with maids ✿ High-breasted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7352" id="noteref-7352" epub:type="noteref">7352</a> virgins weakening forceful sprite;</div>
      <div class="line">Your songs and touch of lute ’mid trembling wine ✿ Consoled all sorrows, made all hearts delight,</div>
      <div class="line">Till you to other deignèd union grant ✿ And I your nature learnt and learnt aright,</div>
      <div class="line">Whereat my vitals failed, sore bane befel, ✿ Pine, disappointment, and injurious blight.</div>
      <div class="line">No virtue dwelleth in the fairest forms ✿ But forms the fairest are by goodness dight.</div>
      <div class="line">How many a maiden deckt with crescent brow ✿ Hath nature dealing injury and despite?</div>
      <div class="line">Man hath no merit save in kindly mind ✿ And loquent tongue with light of wits unite.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7353" id="noteref-7353" epub:type="noteref">7353</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Yusuf had ended his poetry he presented an hundred
dinars to Ibn Ibrahim, who took the letter and fell to cutting
through the wilds and the wolds, after which he went in to the
presence of Al-Hayfa and gave her the missive. She wept and
wailed and cried, “O Ibn Ibrahim, this letter is indeed softer than
all forewent it; and as thou hast brought it to me, O Ibn Ibrahim,
I will largesse thee with two honourable robes of golden brocade
and a thousand dinars.” So saying, she called for pen-case and
paper whereupon she indited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my lord, these words do my vitals destroy, ✿ O thou gem of the earth and full moon a-sky!</div>
      <div class="line">How long this recourse to denial and hate ✿ With heart whose hardness no rocks outvie?</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast left my spirit in parting-pangs ✿ And in fires of farness that flame on high:</div>
      <div class="line">How long shall I ’plain of its inner pains? ✿ Haps thy grace shall grant me reunion-joy:</div>
      <div class="line">Then pity my vitals and whatso homed ✿ Thy form within me before I die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c017">She then handed the paper to Ibn Ibrahim who again set out and
sought the Prince and kissed his hand and gave him the letter;
whereupon said he, “O Ibn Ibrahim, come not thou again bringing
me aught of missive—ever or any more after this one.” Quoth Ibn
Ibrahim, “Wherefore, O my lord, shall I not do on such wise?”
and quoth Yusuf, “Suffer her to learn the fates of menkind.”
Said the other, “I conjure thee, by Allah Almighty, ho thou
the King, inasmuch as thou art of the seed of mighty monarchs,
disappoint her not of her question; and Allah upon thee, unless
thou show pity to her heart it haply will melt away with melancholy
and love and madness for thy sake; and all of this is for
the truth of her affection.” Hereupon Yusuf smiled and taking
up his pen wrote these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Stay thy tears; for hindrance and parting hie, ✿ And the endless of Empire aye glorify:</div>
      <div class="line">From my core of heart fly all cark and care ✿ After parting that seemèd all Time defy.</div>
      <div class="line">A Lion am I for the love of him ✿ Whom the slanderer’s part ne’er can satisfy:</div>
      <div class="line">My mind and soul be this day with you ✿ But my heart and thought are at enmity:</div>
      <div class="line">Thought and mind delight in Love’s cruelty ✿ While heart and soul for reunion cry:</div>
      <div class="line">And if mind and thought e’er can overcome ✿ Soul and heart, Re-union thou ne’er shalt ’spy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Yusuf had finished his writing, he gifted Ibrahim with
an hundred dinars and sent him again to Al-Hayfa with the letter,
and she on receiving it shed tears and said, “O Ibn Ibrahim,
seeing that his soul and heart be with us, Allah Almighty availeth
to turn his thoughts and his fancy and the mind of him.” Hereupon
she took writing materials and wrote:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Calm, O my lord, thy vitals’ painful plight, ✿ O thou whose semblance lighteth sooty night:</div>
      <div class="line">O gladding heart, O sweet of union, Oh ✿ Whose charms the tribe in festal hours delight:</div>
      <div class="line">O high in honour passing height of Kings, ✿ O thou with purest blood ’mid Kings bedight,</div>
      <div class="line">Fear’st not the Throne<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7354" id="noteref-7354" epub:type="noteref">7354</a> of God (O hope of me!) ✿ When harming heart whereon all pains alight?</div>
      <div class="line">Then deign thou grant me union, for such wise ✿ Shall rest my heartstrings and dark care wax bright:</div>
      <div class="line">From none, except that Lion o’ men Ali<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7355" id="noteref-7355" epub:type="noteref">7355</a> ✿ Comes pardon proving to mankind his might.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she passed her missive to Ibn Ibrahim giving him an hundred
gold pieces and he pushed his pace till he reached the city of Sind,
where he went in to Yusuf and kissed his hands and feet. The
Prince taking the letter smiled and laughed and said, “O Ibn
Ibrahim, when Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) shall decree
my faring I will fare to them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7356" id="noteref-7356" epub:type="noteref">7356</a> within a short while; but do thou
return and let know that I intend forgathering with them.” Quoth
the other, “Ah! O my lord, do thou indite her a reply, otherwise
she will have no trust in me;” so the Prince fell to penning these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My vitals restless bide for very jealousy ✿ The while my heart must ever show unfriendly gree:</div>
      <div class="line">Yet I obeyed my heart and tore it out for him ✿ Albe man ever holds his heart in amity;</div>
      <div class="line">And I have heard my lover drives me forth from him ✿ But Allah grant my prayer of benedicite.</div>
      <div class="line">In anxious care I came and sought your side this day ✿ Naught shall the youth exalt save generosity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Prince Yusuf passed the letter to Ibn Ibrahim who, after
receiving his hundred dinars, repaired to Al-Hayfa and greeted
her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7357" id="noteref-7357" epub:type="noteref">7357</a> informing her the while that her lover was about to make
act of presence.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ibn Ibrahim
said to Al-Hayfa, “Verily Yusuf purposeth to visit thee after a
little while.” But when the Princess heard his words she would
not believe him albeit her heart palpitated with pleasure; whereupon
Ibn Ibrahim improvised to her as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou world-seducer and full moon bright, ✿ Stay thy speech and with boon of good news requite.</div>
      <div class="line">Love pledged me his word he would see thee and said, ✿ Hie thee home and order the house aright.</div>
      <div class="line">I awoke this morning in cark and care, ✿ In tears distraught and in dire despite;</div>
      <div class="line">For the wrongs and farness thou doom’st me dree ✿ Have forced my forces to fright-full flight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Ibn Ibrahim had ended his verse, Al-Hayfa joyed with
increased and exceeding joy, and in her delight she answered him
according to the rhyme and rhythm of his verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O who spreadest clouds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7358" id="noteref-7358" epub:type="noteref">7358</a> Son of Ibrahim hight; ✿ By the Lord who ruleth in ’Arshhis height,</div>
      <div class="line">By Mohammed the bestest of men and by ✿ Th’ adorers of yore and the Tá-Há’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7359" id="noteref-7359" epub:type="noteref">7359</a> might,</div>
      <div class="line">By Zemzem, Safá and wall Hatím<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7360" id="noteref-7360" epub:type="noteref">7360</a> ✿ And Ka’abah and glories of Ka’abah’s site,</div>
      <div class="line">An this speech be sooth and my dearling come ✿ One thousand, two thousand dinars are thy right;</div>
      <div class="line">And I’ll give thee a courser, O Ibrahim’s son, ✿ Selle, stirrups and bridle with gold bedight;</div>
      <div class="line">Six turbands and robes that shall honour show ✿ With that courser the colour of blackest night.</div>
      <div class="line">So hold me not like the most of mankind, ✿ Who joy the fair ones to twit and flyte.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Al-Hayfa had finished her verses, Ibn Ibrahim brought
out to her the letter of the Prince, and as soon as she read it her
heart was comforted and she waxed glad with exceeding gladness
and she bade them present him with largesse of value great and a
thousand dinars upon a china plate. After this she took him by
the hand and led him into a closet and said, “O Ibn Ibrahim, all
that be in this cabinet is a free gift to thee when thou shalt have
brought to me that lover of mine.” Such was the case with them;
but as regards Prince Yusuf, when Ibn Ibrahim left him, he felt
love-lowe aflaming in his heart, and he summoned his Mameluke
Hilal and said to him, “Go saddle for us the steed known by the
name of The Bull-aye-ready-and-for-Battle-day-steady.” Hereupon
the slave arose and enselled the courser and Yusuf mounted;
and, taking his Mameluke on the crupper, pushed his pace (and he
madly in love with Al-Hayfa), and he ceased not faring till he
reached her Palace. He then swam the stream with his Mameluke
hanging on, as before, to the tail, and knocked at the door which
was opened by a damsel hight Nuzhat al-Zaman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7361" id="noteref-7361" epub:type="noteref">7361</a> and she
on recognising him kissed his hands and hurrying to her lady
informed her of his coming. Al-Hayfa hearing of the arrival fell
fainting to the ground and when she recovered she found Yusuf
standing beside her head; so she arose and embraced him for a
long while, after which she improvised and said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou Pilgrim of Love, after parting far ✿ From us driven by malice of jealous foe!</div>
      <div class="line">My life for the friend in affection comes; ✿ Naught dearer to me than such boon can show;</div>
      <div class="line">Full many a writ have I written thee ✿ Nor union nor grace of return I know.</div>
      <div class="line">In this world I see him with single heart ✿ O my wish! and Allah ne’er part us two.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when she had ended her verses she bade the slave-girls convey
Ibn Ibrahim and Hilal to the gardens, after which she led Yusuf
to the saloon of session and the twain passed the night together
he and she, in joyance and enjoyment, for that night was indeed a
night of delight. But when Allah bade the morn to morrow,
Al-Hayfa arose and cried, “How short it is for a night: Ah that
it had been longer for us! but ’tis for me to say even as said Imr
al-Kays<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7362" id="noteref-7362" epub:type="noteref">7362</a> in sundry of his verses upon a similar theme:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“On me Night waxeth long nor would I shorten Night; ✿ Yet hasteth Morn when I for longer Nights would sue:</div>
      <div class="line">It brings me union till ’My lover’s mine’ I cry ✿ Yet when with him unite disunion comes to view.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when it was the second day, Al-Hayfa took seat in the
assembly of converse.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa repaired to
the saloon of séance, she and Yusuf, and summoned Ibn Ibrahim
and bade the handmaids bring everything that was in the closet.
They obeyed her bidding and fetched her all the contents, amongst
which were ten robes of honour and three coffers of silk and fine
linen and a packet of musk and a parcel of rubies and pearls and
jacinths and corals and similar objects of high price. And she
conferred the whole of this upon Mohammed ibn Ibrahim, the
while improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“We are noblest of lords amongst men of might; ✿ What we give and largesse bring the most delight:</div>
      <div class="line">And when we strive with our hearts and souls ✿ We strive in public nor rue our plight.</div>
      <div class="line">With me the pact no regret shall breed ✿ Save in head of suspecting envying wight.</div>
      <div class="line">I am none who riseth sans bounteous deed; ✿ I am none who giveth with felon sprite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Al-Hayfa had ended her poetry, Prince Yusuf largessed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7363" id="noteref-7363" epub:type="noteref">7363</a>
Ibn Ibrahim and said to him, “Thou shalt have on my part one
thousand dinars and twenty robes of brocade and an hundred
she-camels and eighty horses (whereof the meanest is worth five
hundred gold pieces and each is saddled with a golden selle), and
lastly forty handmaids.” After which he began to improvise
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Good signeth man to sight and all men see ✿ Sahl’s son is lord of liberality:</div>
      <div class="line">Time and the world and mortals one and all ✿ Witness my goodness and for aye agree:</div>
      <div class="line">Who comes for purpose him I gratify ✿ With boons, though ’twere with eyenlight of me:</div>
      <div class="line">I back my neighbour whenas harmèd by ✿ Dolour of debt and foeman’s tyranny:</div>
      <div class="line">Whoso hath moneys lacking liberal mind ✿ Though he snatch Fortune ’mid the vile is he.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Yusuf had finished his verse, Ibn Ibrahim arose and
bussed his hands and feet and cried, “Allah dole to thee all thou
desirest.” The other replied, “When thou shalt return to our
city, do thou go to my quarters and therefrom take thee whatso I
have promised.” Then the Prince and Princess waxed assiduous
in the eating of meat and the drinking of wine; and this continued
for many successive months<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7364" id="noteref-7364" epub:type="noteref">7364</a> until Ibn Ibrahim craved leave to
visit his folk; and, when he received permission, he took with him
that was light in weight and weighty of worth. And as he set
forth, Al-Hayfa said to him, “When thou shalt return to thy
people in safety, do thou salute for me my sire and name to him a
certain stallion which same he shall largesse to thee and likewise
its saddle and bridle.” Hereupon he farewelled them and went
forth and stemmed the stream and withdrawing his she-dromedary
from the cave harnessed her and mounted her and set forth upon
his desert way, and as soon as he reached the capital of Sind he
went to his folk who greeted him kindly. Now when King Al-Mihrjan
heard of Mohammed ibn Ibrahim’s coming he sent to
summon him and as soon as he appeared between his hands he
asked concerning his absence. “O King of the Time and the
Tide,” quoth he, “I have been in Yathrib<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7365" id="noteref-7365" epub:type="noteref">7365</a> city;” and indeed he
was one of the cup-companions of Al-Hayfa’s father and by the
decree of Destiny he had been ever in high favour with the King.
So the twain sat down to drink wine and as Fortune willed it Ibn
Ibrahim bore about him a letter containing poetry, part of the
correspondence between the Prince and Princess, wherein were
written the names of all three. Now when he was at the height
of his joy he wagged his head and shook off his turband and the
paper fell therefrom into Al-Mihrjan’s lap.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7366" id="noteref-7366" epub:type="noteref">7366</a> The King took it and
read it and understood its contents but he kept the case secret
for a while; presently, however, he dismissed his Courtiers and
Equerries who were around him and forthright bade smite
Mohammed ibn Ibrahim with stripes until his sides were torn.
Then quoth he, “Acquaint me concerning this youth who correspondeth
with my daughter, making thee the goer between them
twain, otherwise I will cut off thy head.” Quoth Ibn Ibrahim,
“Ho thou the King; verily this be only poetry which I found in
one of the histories of old.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——“With love and
good will!” It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ibn Ibrahim said to
Al-Mihrjan, “Verily I found this poetry in a tale of the olden
time.” So the King issued orders to smite his neck, when intercession
was made for him by a Courtier hight Tá’il al-Wasf,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7367" id="noteref-7367" epub:type="noteref">7367</a>
whereupon the King commanded him to jail, whither he was taken
forthright. But as Ibn Ibrahim was being locked up, he said to
the gaoler, “Say me, canst thou bring for me a pen-case and paper
and pen?” and the other assented, fetching for him whatso he
wanted. So he wrote to Prince Yusuf the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Yúsuf, master mine, for safety fly; ✿ In sorest danger Ibrahim’s son doth lie:</div>
      <div class="line">When from thy side for house and home he sped ✿ Forthright bade Al-Mihrjan to bring him nigh,</div>
      <div class="line">And ’mid th’ Assembly highest stead assigned ✿ A seat in public with a sleight full sly.</div>
      <div class="line">A writ thou wrotest bore he on his head ✿ Which fell and picked it up the King to ’spy:</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis thus discovered he thy state and raged ✿ With wrath and fain all guidance would defy.</div>
      <div class="line">Then bade he Ibrahim’s son on face be thrown ✿ And painful beating to the bare apply;</div>
      <div class="line">With stripes he welted and he tare his sides ✿ Till force waxed feeble, strength debility.</div>
      <div class="line">So rise and haste thee to thine own and fetch ✿ Thy power, and instant for the tribe-lands hie;</div>
      <div class="line">Meanwhile I’ll busy to seduce his men ✿ Who hear me, O thou princely born and high;</div>
      <div class="line">For of the painful stress he made me bear ✿ The fire of bane I’ve sworn him even I.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Ibn Ibrahim had finished his verse, he said to the gaoler,
“Do thou summon for me the son of my brother hight Manná’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7368" id="noteref-7368" epub:type="noteref">7368</a>
and thou shalt have from me one hundred gold pieces.” The man
did his bidding, and when the youth came the uncle gave him
the letter and bespake him as follows: “O son of my brother,
take thou this paper and fare with it to the Castle of Al-Hayfa
and swim the stream, and go up to the building and enter
therein and commit this missive unto a youth whom thou shalt
see sitting beside the Princess. Then do thou greet him with the
salam from me, and inform him of all that I am in and what I
have seen and what thou hast witnessed, and for this service I will
give thee an hundred gold pieces.” The nephew took the uncle’s
letter and set forth from the first of the night until he drew nigh
the Castle. Such was the case with Ibn Ibrahim and his sending
his nephew Manna’ on a mission to the Princess; but as regards
King Al-Mihrjan, when the morning morrowed and showed its
sheen and shone and the sun uprose with rays a-lowland strown,
he sent to summon Ibn Ibrahim; and, when they set him between
his hands, he adjured him saying, “O thou! by the rights of the
God unique in his rule for Unity; by Him who set up the skies
without prop and stay and dispread the Earths firmly upon the
watery way, unless thou inform me and apprise me rightly and
truly I will order thy head to be struck off this very moment.”
So the cup-companion related to the King the whole affair of
Princess Al-Hayfa and Prince Yusuf, and all that had passed
between the twain; whereupon Al-Mihrjan asked, “And this
Yusuf from what land may he be?” “He is son to the Sovran
of Sind, King Sahl,” quoth the other, and quoth Al-Mihrjan,
“And is he still in the Palace, or hath he gone to his own
country?” “He was therein,” replied Ibn Ibrahim, “but I
know not whether he be yet there, or he be gone thence.” Hereupon
Al-Mihrjan commanded his host at once to mount, and all
took horse and rode forth making for the Castle of Al-Hayfa.
Now, between Manna’ and King Al-Mihrjan was a march of only
a single night, when the youth went up to the Palace of the
Princess, where he knocked at the door and they opened and
admitted him to the presence of Prince Yusuf. There he handed
to him the letter, which the Prince opened and read; then he
suddenly rose up crying upon Hilal, whom when he was fetched
he bade forthwith bring out his steed. Hereat cried Al-Hayfa,
“I ask thee by Allah, O my lord, what may be the news?” and he
answered her, “Verily when Ibn Ibrahim fared from us to his folk
he was summoned on his arrival by thy sire, and he went to
him and informed him of all that hath befallen us, first and last.”
So saying he put the letter into her hands, and she having read it
exclaimed, “O my lord, do thou take me with thee lest haply he
slay me.” Answered the Prince, “O end and aim of mine every
wish, we have naught with us save this one steed who availeth
not to carry three; therefore will thy father overtake us upon the
road and will put us to death one and all. Now the rede that is
right be this, that thou conceal thyself somewhere in the Palace
and charge the slave-girls when thy sire shall come hither, to tell
him that I have carried thee off to mine own country, and for the
rest be thou assured that I will tarry away from thee but a few
days.” So saying Yusuf took his horse with him and Hilal his
page a-crupper and swam the river and made for his own land
pushing his pace, and presently he drew within sight of the capital.
Such was the case of Prince Yusuf, son to King Sahl; but as
regards the matter of King Al-Mihrjan and his host, he ceased not
marching them till such time as he came within sight of the Castle
of his daughter Al-Hayfa; and this was soon after the departure
of Yusuf. And when he had led hither his host, which was like
unto a dashing sea, he dismounted upon the river-bank that all
might free themselves of their fatigue, after which he summoned
Sahlub and bade him swim the stream and walk up to the Castle
and knock at the door. The youth did as he was bidden, and the
handmaids opened to him and greeted him as he asked for Al-Hayfa——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Sahlub
went up to the Palace, he asked of Al-Hayfa, and the slave-girls
told him that a youth had come thither and had taken her away
and had carried her off to his own country. So he returned to
Al-Mihrjan and informed him thereof, when the King took horse
with all his host and pursued Yusuf with uttermost haste and
hurry until there was between the twain less than a day’s march.
But as the Prince drew near his capital on the tenth day he went
in to his sire and told him whatso had befallen him from incept to
conclusion, nor did he hide from him aught; whereupon King
Sahl mustered his many (all who received from him royal solde
and allowances), and bade them take horse with his son Yusuf.
The troops did accordingly and the Prince rode a-van, and after a
little while the two armies met. Now Ibn Ibrahim had made a
compact with five of the nobles who were the chiefest men of King
Al-Mihrjan’s reign and had promised them five hundred thousand
dinars. So when the two hosts were about to engage, an Emir of
the Emirs came forth (and he was one of those whom Ibn Ibrahim
had appointed to watch over Yusuf) and said to the Prince, “O Son
of the King, verily Ibn Ibrahim hath promised five of the nobles
as many hundred thousand dinars of gold the which we may take
and receive from thee.” Replied he, “The like sum shall be
thine from me with all thou canst ask of us.” Presently the Emir
returned from him to Al-Mihrjan and said to him, “Verily I have
asked this youth that he make vain and void the battle between
us twain, but he assented not and sware an oath that he would
never return from affray until the enemies should meet and fight
it out, and that he had with him a mighty host and a conquering
whose van was not known from its rear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7369" id="noteref-7369" epub:type="noteref">7369</a> Now ’tis my rede that
thou strive to take him prisoner<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7370" id="noteref-7370" epub:type="noteref">7370</a> and then do whatso he may
please, especially he being son to thee, King of the mighty Kings
and with him a thousand thousand knights all mailed cap-à-pie
and clothed in steel not one of whom hath any fear of fight.”
King Al-Mihrjan waxed wroth at the Emir’s speech and cried,
“What words be these? Shall the Kings of the Age remain
saying of me that a man hath debauched the daughter of Al-Mihrjan
and hath carried her away perforce despite the nose of
her father? Never shall such thing be spoken of me; no, never!
But do thou know, ho thou the Amir, that an ye have no taste
for fray nor avail for fight and ye have no training save for bibbing
of wine and ease at home, I have sworn and swear by Him who
lighted the lucident fires of the Sun and the Moon, none shall
sally forth to do single combat with this youth save I myself.”
But when so saying he knew not that was hidden from him in the
World of Secrets. Presently he rushed into the field of fight with
reins floating upon his courser’s neck and he renowned it, showing
himself between the foremost files, and he played with the edge of
glaive and spit of spear until men’s wits were bewildered and he
improvised the while and cried out the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ibn Sahl, ho scion of tree abhorr’d! ✿ Rise, meet me in mellay and prove thee lord:</div>
      <div class="line">My daughter hast snatched, O thou foul of deed, ✿ And approachest me fearing the Lion of the horde.</div>
      <div class="line">Hadst come in honour and fairly sued ✿ I had made her thine own with the best accord;</div>
      <div class="line">But this rape hath o’erwhelmed in dishonour foul ✿ Her sire, and all bounds thou hast overscor’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when King Al-Mihrjan finished his verse, Yusuf rushed out
to him, and cried at him with a terrible cry and a terrifying, and
garred his own steed bound upon the battle-plain, where he played
with brand and lance until he cast into oblivion every knight,
reciting in the meantime the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am son to Al-Sahl, O of forbears vile! ✿ Come forth and fight me sans guile or wile;</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast hurt my heart; O of deed misdone, ✿ So thou com’st to contend with this rank and file.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7371" id="noteref-7371" epub:type="noteref">7371</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>King Al-Mihrjan re-echoed his war-cry, but hardly had he ended
when Yusuf drawing near him answered it with a shout which
enquaked his heart and ravished his reason with sore terror, and
repeated in reply these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am not to be titled of forbears vile ✿ O whose ape-like face doth the tribe defile!</div>
      <div class="line">Nay, I’m rending lion amid mankind, ✿ A hero in wilds where the murks beguile.</div>
      <div class="line">Al-Hayfá befitteth me, only me; ✿ Ho thou whom men for an ape<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7372" id="noteref-7372" epub:type="noteref">7372</a> revile.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Yusuf had ended these words, Al-Mihrjan rushed forth and
charged down upon him, and the two drawing nigh each of the
foemen set on the other with a mighty onset and a prodigious.
They fought in duello and lanced out with lance and smote with
sword, and dashed together as they were two ships or two mountains
clashing; and they approached and retired, and the dust-cloud
arose over them and they disappeared from men’s sight. But
hardly had an hour passed by when Yusuf made a final attack
upon his enemy and narrowed his course and barred his way and
pressed him hard; and, hanging upon his flank, smote him with the
scymitar upon the nape of the neck<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7373" id="noteref-7373" epub:type="noteref">7373</a> and caused his head to fall
between his feet, when he slipt from his steed upon the ground,
and he lay stone dead and in his gore drowned. Now as soon as
the folk looked upon Yusuf and what he had dealt to their King
and how he had made his head fly his body and had done him
dead, they turned to take flight. Thereupon Yusuf recognised
Sahlub the cousin of Al-Hayfa, he who had been the cause of
their separation and had roused her wrath against him; so he
drew near to him and smote him with the bright shining blade on
the right flank, and it came forth gleaming between his left ribs;
so he fell to the ground drenched with blood, and he was left
prostrate in the dust. And when Yusuf had slain King Al-Mihrjan
and Sahlub, his nephew, the Grandees of the realm came around
him and greeted him with the salam.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundredth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Grandees of King Al-Mihrjan’s reign saw their Sovran slain, they
flocked to Prince Yusuf and greeted him, marvelling at his beauty
and valour and excellence: then they all agreed to salute him
as their Sultan and they raised him to the rank of King
and sole ruler over them. Presently they led him with them,
and fared seeking the city of Al-Mihrjan until they reached it,
when they adorned the streets on the occasion of his coming.
And King Yusuf having entered his capital took seat on the throne
of his kingship and bade and forbade and deposed and appointed;
and lastly freed Mohammed ibn Ibrahim from gaol, and established
him his Wazir. Hereupon the new Minister displayed to him the
four wives and the hundred concubines of King Al-Mihrjan, also
his negro slaves, male and female, whom he found to number two
hundred and four hundred. Moreover, he showed his riches and
rarities and treasuries wherein were found an hundred boxes full
of silk and fine linen, and parcels of pearls and rubies and jacinths
and jewels and precious minerals and other wealth in abundance.
So he distributed the whole amongst his nobles, and largessed
them with excessive largesses; and his partisans of his subjects
and his guards flocked to him with presents and offerings; and all
the city-folk gave him joy and rejoiced in him. Then he commissioned
Ibn Ibrahim to Al-Hayfa, daughter of King Al-Mihrjan,
saying, “Do thou bring her hither to me, her and her handmaids
and all that be in her palace.” Accordingly he went forth to Al-Hayfa’s
Castle, and ceased not wending till he came to its entrance
where he discovered that King Yusuf had appointed a craft for
the river transport. And when he arrived there and found the
vessel afloat he went in to Al-Hayfa and he greeted her. Then
he related to her what had betided her sire from Yusuf and how
the Prince had slain him after the fashion of what befel; so she
cried, “There is no Majesty and no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great; and this was writ in the Book of Life!”
Then she asked Ibn Ibrahim touching her mother, and he answered
that she was sound and safe in her own home which she had
never left nor did any one go in to her; and, (added he) “she
expecteth thy coming to her.” Then he bade carry down her
impediments and her bondmaids and all the good that was in her
Castle until nothing remained, and embarked them upon the craft;
and presently, mounting her in a litter of sandal-wood plated with
ruddy gold, he set her women in Howdahs;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7374" id="noteref-7374" epub:type="noteref">7374</a> and, taking horse
himself, he rode until they drew near the city. And when they
arrived there he went up to King Yusuf whom he informed of
their coming and was told, “Suffer them to be till night shall set
in.” Hereupon he took patience, and when came the appointed
term Al-Hayfa went up to the Palace. Now as Allah caused
the morn to morrow and to light the world with its shine and
sheen, King Yusuf sent to summon the Kazi and witnesses and
bade them write his writ of marriage with Al-Hayfa and was
wedded to her by Book and traditional Usage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7375" id="noteref-7375" epub:type="noteref">7375</a> After this Al-Hayfa
sent to fetch her mother and bore her to her home and their
joy and enjoyment were great and lasting. Now by the decree
of the Decreer anon it befel that the Caliph Al-Maamun waxed
strait of breast one night of the nights: so he summoned a certain
of his courtiers whose name was Ibrahim the Cup-companion;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7376" id="noteref-7376" epub:type="noteref">7376</a>
but, as they found him not, he bade bring a man hight Al-Khadí’a,
and when he came between his hands quoth he to him “’Tis a
while since I have seen thee here.” Quoth the other, “O Commander
of the Faithful, I have been wayfaring about the land of
Syria.” Continued the Prince of True Believers, “Do thou this
very night broaden the Caliph’s heart with a delectable tale;” and
the other rejoined, “O Viceregent of Allah upon Earth, know
thou an adventure befel me with a youth named the Veiled Yusuf
of Beauty, son to King Sahl, the friendly ruler of Al-Sind, and with
Al-Hayfa the daughter of King Al-Mihrjan, and ’tis a tale whose
like hath never been heard; no, never.” Hereupon he related to
Al-Maamun the history of the two, first and last, adding, “Furthermore,
O Commander of the Faithful, I have learnt that Al-Hayfa
owneth ten handmaidens whose peers are not to be found in thy
Palace, and they are mistresses of all manner instruments of mirth
and merriment and other matters; and amongst things said of
them by their lady when they marvelled at her good fortune,”
“Verily this day I have acquired half a score of slave-girls the like
of which Al-Maamun hath never collected.” But when the
Prince of True Believers heard this he gave ear to the tale anent
them during the livelong night till Allah caused the morn to
morrow. Then he sent for Ibrahim the Cup-companion, and to
him coming into the presence the Viceregent of Allah exclaimed,
“Mount without stay and delay taking with thee one thousand
Mamelukes and make thy way to this youth who is King of Al-Sind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7377" id="noteref-7377" epub:type="noteref">7377</a>
and named ’The Veiled Yusuf of Beauty,’ and bring me his
ten handmaidens. After which do thou ask concerning his case and
anent his subjects, whether he be just or unjust to the lieges, and
if he be righteous I will robe him in honourable robes and if
otherwise do thou bring him to my presence.” Hereupon Ibrahim
took leave of the Caliph and went forth at that very time and tide
intending for Al-Sind, and he ceased not wending till he arrived
there and found Yusuf setting out for the chase. But when the youth
saw the host approaching him——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night, and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that, when Yusuf
beheld Ibrahim the Cup-companion, and those in his company, he
returned to the city and took them with him; yet he knew not
Ibrahim nor did Ibrahim know him. But on entering the capital
he was met by his guards and his soldiers who blessed him and
prayed for him length of days and permanence of rule wherefor
the courtier knew him to be a just King. Yusuf led them to and
lodged them in the House of Hospitality; after which returning
to his own Palace he sent for Ibrahim and assembled for him a
session and received him with the highmost honour that could be,
and rose to him and greeted him and embraced him and accompanied
him to the sitting-saloon where the twain took their places.
Then Yusuf bade summon the ten handmaidens with as many
instruments of music; and, sitting down begirt by them, he
ordered wine be brought. So they set before him flagons and
beakers of chrystal and jewelled cups; and presently pointing to
the first of the slave-girls whose name is not recorded, bade her
recite somewhat of her pleasantest poetry. So she hent the lute
in hand and set it upon her lap and swept it with a light touch
and caressed it with her finger-tips and smote it after eleven
modes; then she returned to the first<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7378" id="noteref-7378" epub:type="noteref">7378</a> and recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My heart for parting ever burns with lowe; ✿ My lids fiery with tear-floods ever flow:</div>
      <div class="line">Ho thou in lover’s loving ferly fair, ✿ Cut is the road for those Love gars to glow.</div>
      <div class="line">How many a youth has felt his vitals torn ✿ By slender forms and glances forceful prow?</div>
      <div class="line">Alas for lover slain by might of Love; ✿ Nor friend avails nor brother true, I trow!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the first handmaiden had finished, Yusuf rejoiced (as did
Ibrahim the Cup-companion) with excessive joy and the King
bade robe her in a sumptuous robe. Hereupon she drained her
cup and passed it to her compeer whose name was Takná, and
this second handmaiden taking beaker in hand placed it afore
her and hending the lute smote on it with many a mode; then,
returning to the first<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7379" id="noteref-7379" epub:type="noteref">7379</a> while the wits of all were bewildered, she
improvised the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Look on the lute that ’minds of Mangonel; ✿ Whose strings are ropes that make each shot to tell:</div>
      <div class="line">And note the pipes that sound with shriek and cry, ✿ The pipes that cast a fearful joyful spell;</div>
      <div class="line">Espy the flagons ranged in serried rank ✿ And crops becrowned with wine that longs to well.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But when Takná had finished her poetry Yusuf and Ibrahim were
gladdened and the King bade largesse her with a sumptuous robe
and a thousand dinars and she tossed off her cup and passed it to
her successor the third handmaiden Mubdi’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7380" id="noteref-7380" epub:type="noteref">7380</a> hight. She accepted
it and setting it before her took the lute and smote it after
manifold fashions and presently she spake these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Love with his painful pine doth rack this frame of me; ✿ Melts heart and maims my vitals cruel agony;</div>
      <div class="line">And rail my tears like cloud that rains the largest drops; ✿ And fails my hand to find what seek I fain to see:</div>
      <div class="line">Thee I conjure, O Yúsuf, by Him made thee King ✿ O Sahl-son, Oh our dearest prop, our dignity,</div>
      <div class="line">This man methinks hath come to part us lovers twain ✿ For in his eyes I see the flame of jealousy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Mubdi’ had sung her song, Ibrahim the Cup-companion
and King Yusuf smiled and rejoiced and anon there befel them
what there befel and the two slipt down aswoon;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King
Yusuf and Ibrahim the Cup-companion hearing the song sung by
Mubdi’, the third handmaiden, both fell to the floor aswoon; and
when they revived after an hour or so, Ibrahim largessed to her
one thousand dinars and a robe purfled with glistening gold.
Then she drained her cup and crowning it again passed it to her
compeer whose name was Nasím<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7381" id="noteref-7381" epub:type="noteref">7381</a> and who took it and set it in
front of her. Then hending in hand the lute she played upon it
with manifold modes and lastly spake these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Blamer, blaming me for draining lonely wine, ✿ Stint carping, I this day to Holy War incline:</div>

      <div class="line">How mention her? By Allah ’tis forbid in writ ✿ To note the meaner charms in Eden-garth divine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the fourth handmaiden had ended her verse, Ibrahim
gifted her with one thousand dinars and presented a sumptuous
robe to her owner, then she drank off her cup and passed it to
her compeer hight Al-Badr<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7382" id="noteref-7382" epub:type="noteref">7382</a> and she sang the following lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“One robbed of heart amid song and wine ✿ And Love that smiteth with babe of eyne:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had finished Ibrahim bade reward her like the rest
with gold and gear and she passed her cup to her compeer whose
name was Radáh.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7384" id="noteref-7384" epub:type="noteref">7384</a> The sixth handmaiden drained it and performed
in four-and-twenty modes after which she sang these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou wine-comrade languor cease to show; ✿ Hand me the morning draught and ne’er foreslow;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Radah ended her verse and her improvising of mysterious
significance, and secret, King Yusuf and Ibrahim the Cup-companion
tore their robes from their bodies until naught remained
upon them save only the bag-breeches about their waists. Then
the twain shrieked aloud and at one moment and they fell fainting
to the floor, unheeding the world and their own selves from the
excess of that was in their heads of wine and hearing of poetry
spoken by the slave-girl. They remained in such condition for a
while of time, after which they recovered though still amazed,
a-drunken. Then they donned other dresses and sat down to
listen as before, when Radah drained her goblet and filled and
passed it to her compeer whose name was Na’ím;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7386" id="noteref-7386" epub:type="noteref">7386</a> and she taking
her lute, improvised the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My poesy-gem showeth clear of shine, ✿ When appears that pearl with cheek coralline:</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis marvel the cloud cannot quench the blaze ✿ That fire in the heart and this water of eyne!</div>
      <div class="line">Then alas for Love who hath made me woe! ✿ Pine that rends and racks limbs and vitals o’ mine:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou Well of Poetry well forth thy gems ✿ O’er our drink when our cups overbrim with wine:</div>

      <div class="line">Oh the charms of wine which enthral the mind, ✿ Clear and clearing sprites by its sprite refined!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the seventh handmaiden had ended her verses, King Yusuf
and Ibrahim rejoiced with exceeding joy and each of them bade
gift her with a thousand gold pieces and quoth the courtier, “By
Allah Almighty, none of the Emirs or of the Wazirs or of the
Kings or of the Caliphs hath attained excellence like unto this
handmaid. Hereupon Na’im passed her goblet to her compeer
and she, whose name was Surúr,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7387" id="noteref-7387" epub:type="noteref">7387</a> tossed it off and taking in hand
her lute, sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“How is’t with heart of me all cares waylay ✿ As drowned in surging, tears of Deluge-day?</div>
      <div class="line">I weep for Time endured not to us twain ✿ As though Time’s honour did not oft betray.</div>
      <div class="line">O my lord Yúsuf, O my ending hope, ✿ By Him who made thee lone on Beauty’s way,</div>
      <div class="line">I dread lest glorious days us twain depart ✿ And youth’s bright world be dimmed to old and grey;</div>
      <div class="line">O Lord! be Parting’s palm for us undyed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7388" id="noteref-7388" epub:type="noteref">7388</a> ✿ Ere death, nor carry this my lord away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the eighth handmaiden had ended her song, the twain
marvelled at her eloquence and were like to rend that was upon
them of raiment——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
goodwill! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King Yusuf and Ibrahim
the Cup-companion were like to rend that was upon them of
raiment and they joyed with extreme joy after hearing what
Surúr had sang to them. Hereupon she passed her cup to her
fellow, hight Zahrat al-Hayy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7389" id="noteref-7389" epub:type="noteref">7389</a> who took it and recited as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O cup-boy, I crave thee cup-comrade to be ✿ And hearten my heart of its malady;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor pass me the bowls for I sorely dread ✿ When drunken all dolours of Love-lowe to dree,</div>
      <div class="line">To be vilely reviled in the sittings of men, ✿ To be frowardly treated where zephyrs play free.</div>
      <div class="line">God-blest is the Lute for her melodies ✿ Which pain me with painfullest penalty,</div>
      <div class="line">With the jewels of speech whose transcendent charms ✿ Like fires of Jahím<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7390" id="noteref-7390" epub:type="noteref">7390</a> burn the vitals of me.</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, show ruth, be compassionate, ✿ For Allah deals pardon compassionately.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Yusuf and Ibrahim, hearing her words, were gladdened with
excessive gladness and cried to the ninth handmaid, “May the
lord be copious to thee like the fruitful years!” Then the Cup-companion
bade gift her with one thousand gold pieces as likewise
did her lord. Hereupon she passed her cup to the tenth
handmaiden known as Muhjat al-Kulúb<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7391" id="noteref-7391" epub:type="noteref">7391</a> who fell to improvising
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Blamer, who canst not my case explain; ✿ Cease, for who blame friends shall of blame complain;</div>
      <div class="line">And whoso unknoweth the workings of Love ✿ Mankind shall reckon him mean and vain:</div>
      <div class="line">Alas for Love, O ye tribe-landers, I ✿ Am weaned that wont nipples of union to drain.</div>
      <div class="line">I have learnt the whole of Love’s governance ✿ Since my baby days amid cradles lain.</div>
      <div class="line">Forbear by Allah to ask of my state ✿ How shall morn one bannèd with debtor bane?</div>
      <div class="line">O thou jewel of speech, O thou Yúsuf, laud ✿ To the Lord who robed thee with charms amain!</div>
      <div class="line">Deign the God of ’Arsh make thy days endure ✿ In wealth and honour sans pause or wane;</div>
      <div class="line">E’en as Ishák’s son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7392" id="noteref-7392" epub:type="noteref">7392</a> every gift conjoined ✿ Amid men, making rulers to serve him fain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Muhjat al-Kulub ended her song, Yusuf gifted her with a
splendid robe and a thousand gold pieces as eke did Ibrahim, and
presently the courtier said to the handmaiden, “Who is Ibrahim
that thou shouldst sing of him in song?” She replied, “Walláhi,
O my lord, he is son of Ishak, amongst the pleasant ones sans peer
and a cup-companion to the Caliphs dear and the pearl concealed
and the boon friend of our lord the Commander of the Faithful
Al-Maamún and his familiar who to him joy and enjoyment
maketh known. Ah! happy the man who can look upon him
and forgather with him and company with him before his death;
and verily by Allah he is the master of the Age and the one Wonder
of the World. Moreover, by the Almighty, O my lord, wert thou
to see this lute fall into his hands, thou wouldst hear it converse in
every language with the tongues of birds and beasts and of the
sons of Adam: and well nigh would the place dance ere he had
improvised a word. And he the horizons can make to joy and
lover with overlove can destroy, nor shall any after his decease
such excellence of speech employ.” All this, and Muhjat al-Kulub
knew not who was sitting beside them as she went on to praise
Ibrahim. Hereupon he took the lute from her hand and smote it
till thou hadst deemed that within the instrument lurked babes of
the Jinns<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7393" id="noteref-7393" epub:type="noteref">7393</a> which were crying and wailing while spake the strings,
and in fine King Yusuf imagined that the palace had upflown
with them between heaven and earth. And the handmaidens sang
to his tunes in sore astonishment; when Ibrahim designed to talk
but King Yusuf cut him short and fell to saying poetry in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“By the rights of our lord who shows ruth in extreme, ✿ And Giver and Guide and boon Prophet we deem,</div>
      <div class="line">And by Ka’abah resplendent and all its site ✿ And by Zemzem, Safá and the wall Hatím,</div>
      <div class="line">Lo! thou ’rt hight Ibrahim, and suppose I say ✿ Thee sooth, my wits thou must surely esteem:</div>
      <div class="line">And thy face shows signalled with clearest eyne ✿ Delivrance followed by Yá and Mím.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7394" id="noteref-7394" epub:type="noteref">7394</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now Ibrahim kept his secret and did not manifest himself to
any, but presently he also improvised and spake in these words
preserving the measure and rhyme:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“By Him who chose Musà, the Speaker,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7395" id="noteref-7395" epub:type="noteref">7395</a> by Him ✿ Who made<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7396" id="noteref-7396" epub:type="noteref">7396</a> Háshimite orphan select and supreme!</div>
      <div class="line">Ibrahim am I not, but I deem this one ✿ The Caliph who sits by Baghdadian stream;</div>
      <div class="line">Of his grace the heir of all eloquent arts ✿ And no partner hath he in all gifts that beseem.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Ibrahim had finished his verses, Yusuf said to him,
“By the virtue of Almighty Allah, an I guess aright and my shot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7397" id="noteref-7397" epub:type="noteref">7397</a>
go not amiss, thou art Ibrahim the musician;” but the courtier
retained his incognito and replied, “O my lord, Ibrahim is my
familiar friend and I am a man of Al-Basrah who hath stolen
from him sundry of his modes and airs for the lute and other
instruments and I have the practice of improvisation.” Now when
Ibrahim was speaking behold, there came one of the Caliph’s
pages and he walked up to the head of the assembly bearing with
him a letter, which he handed to his lord. But Yusuf put forth
his hand and took it, and after reading the superscription he learnt
that his companion was Ibrahim without doubt or mistake, so he
said to him, “By Allah, O my lord, verily thou hast slighted me,
for that thou hast not informed me of thyself.” Quoth the other,
“By Allah, I feared from thee lest I give thee excess of trouble;”
and quoth Yusuf, “Do thou take to thee all these handmaids
whom the Commander of the Faithful hath bid thee receive.”
Ibrahim replied, “Nay, I will not accept from thee the handmaidens
but rather will I fend from thee the Prince of True
Believers;” however, King Yusuf rejoined, “I have gifted them
to the Viceregent of Allah: an thou take them not I will send
them by other than thyself.” Presently King Yusuf set apart for
the Caliph great store of gifts, and when the handmaidens heard
of that they wept with sore weeping. Ibrahim, hearing their
wailing, found it hard to bear, and he also shed tears for the
sobbing and crying of them; and presently he exclaimed, “Allah
upon thee, O Yusuf, leave these ten handmaidens by thee and I
will be thy ward with the Prince of True Believers.” But Yusuf
answered, “Now by the might of Him who stablished the mountains
stable, unless thou bear them away with thee I will despatch
them escorted by another.” Hereupon Ibrahim took them and
farewelled King Yusuf and fared forth and hastened his faring
till the party arrived at Baghdad, the House of Peace, where he
went up into the Palace of the Commander of the Faithful——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the
next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Ibrahim
reached Baghdad and went up to the Palace of the Commander of
the Faithful and stood in the presence he was asked, “What hast
thou brought for us from thy journey, O Ibrahim?” whereto he
answered, “O our lord, I have come to thee with all thou willest
and wishest that of rede be right and of word apposite.” Quoth he,
“And what may that be?” and quoth the other, “The ten
handmaids:” and so saying he set them before the Caliph,
whereupon they kissed ground and did him suit and service and
deprecated for him and greeted him with blessings, and each and
every of them addressed him in tongue most eloquent and with
theme most prevalent. The Prince of True Believers hugely
admired them, marvelling at their deftness of address and their
sweetness of speech which he had never witnessed in any other;
and he was delighted with their beauty and loveliness and their
stature and symmetrical grace, and he wondered with extreme
wonderment how their lord had consented they should be brought
before him. Then cried he, “O Ibrahim, what hath been thy
case with the owner of these damsels, and did he commit them to
thee despite himself in anger and care or with resignation of mind
and broadening of bosom and joy and satisfaction?” “O my
lord,” said Ibrahim, “verily he made them over to me in none
except the best of dispositions, and Allah give him length of life
for a youth! How benign was his countenance and how beautiful,
and how perfect and how liberal were his hands and prompt to
act, and how excellent were his wits and how goodly and gracious
was his society and how yielding was his nature and how great
was his dignity and how just were his dealings with his lieges!
By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, when I went to him
from thee I found him outside his city intending for the hunt and
chase and about to enjoy himself in pleasurable case, but seeing
our coming he met me and salam’d to me and greeted me and
rejoiced in me with extreme joy. All this, and he knew me not
nor did I on my part know him; but he took me with him and
returned to town, and as we entered he was met by the Lords of
the land and the lieges who prayed for him; so I knew that man
to be their King and Captain of commandment, also that he was
equitable to his subjects. Then he made me alight in his House
of Hospitality, and went up into his Palace, after which he sent
to call me and I obeyed his summons, when he set apart for me
an apartment under his own roof and taking me by the hand led
me thereto, where I found everything the best that could be.
Anon he despatched for us wine and wax candles and perfumes
and fruits fresh and dry and whatnot of that which becometh such
assembly; and, when this was done, he bade summon the ten
handmaidens, and they also took their seats in the session, and
they smote their instruments and they sang verse wherein each
one excelled her companion. But one of them insisted in her
song upon the name of me, saying:—None availeth to compose
such lines save Ibrahim the Cup-companion, the son of Ishak. Now
I had denied myself to their lord and acquainted him not with my
name; but when the damsel had finished her verse, I largessed to
her a thousand gold pieces and asked her, Who may be this
Ibrahim whereat thou hast hinted in thy song? Said she, He is
the boon-companion of the Caliph and he is unique among the
pleasant; then she fell to praising me with praise galore than
which naught could be more, unknowing me the while, until I
took the lute from her hand and smote it with a touch unlike
their play. Hereby their lord discovered me and said in his
verse:—Thou art Ibrahim without doubt or mistake; but still I
denied myself replying, I am a man from Al-Basrah and a familiar
of Ibrahim the Master-Musician: And on this wise I answered
him, when behold, there came up to us a page bearing a rescript
from thee. So King Yusuf took it from his hand and read the
address when he made certain that I was Ibrahim, the Cup-companion,
and having learnt my name he blamed me saying:—O
Ibrahim, thou hast denied thyself to me. O my lord, I replied,
’Twas that I feared for thee excess of trouble; after which quoth
he, Verily these ten damsels are a free gift from me to the
Commander of the Faithful. Hearing these words I refused to
receive them and promised on my return to the Caliph that I
would defend their lord from all detraction, but he cried, O
Ibrahim, unless thou take them I will forward them with other
than thyself. And lastly, O Prince of True Believers, he presented
to me fifty slave-girls and as many Mamelukes and an
hundred and fifty negro-serviles and twenty steeds of purest blood,
with their housings and furniture, and four hundred she-camels
and twenty pods of musk.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7398" id="noteref-7398" epub:type="noteref">7398</a>” Then having told his tale, the
Cup-companion fell to commending Yusuf, and the Caliph
inclined ear to him admiring at this man and his generosity
and his openness of hand and the eloquence of his tongue and
the excellence of his manners, until Al-Maamun desired to forgather
with him and work him weal and gift him with liberal
gifts. Presently the Caliph bade summon the ten handmaidens
and the hour was past supper-tide, at which time Ibrahim the
Cup-companion, was seated beside him without other being
present. And as soon as the girls came before him the Caliph
bade them take their seats, and when they obeyed his order the
wine cups went merrily round, and the ten were directed to let
him hear somewhat of their chaunting and playing. So they fell to
smiting their instruments of mirth and merriment and singing
their songs, one after other, and each as she ended her poetry
touched the Caliph with delight until it came to the last of
them, who was hight Muhjat al-Kulúb;——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the last
poetical piece recited by the ten damsels to the Commander of
the Faithful was by Muhjat al-Kulub; and he upon hearing it
rose at once to his feet and shrieked and fell aswoon for an hour
of time. And when he recovered he cried, “By Allah, O Muhjat
al-Kulub and Oh of eyne the coolth, do thou repeat to me what
thou hast said.” Hereupon she touched her instrument with
another touch accompanying the repetition of her poetry in a
style wholly unlike the first, and she repeated her song in the
mode and form Nahawand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7399" id="noteref-7399" epub:type="noteref">7399</a> But when the Caliph heard her, his
wits were wildered, and he rent that was upon him of raiment,
and he fell fainting to the floor until Ibrahim the Cup-companion
and the ten handmaidens deemed him dead. But as he revived
after an hour of time he said to the handmaiden, “O Muhjat al-Kulub,
ask and it shall be granted to thee.” “I pray,” quoth
she, “first of Allah and then of the Commander of the Faithful
that he restore us, all the ten, unto our lord;” and he granted
her request after he had gifted them all and largessed them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7400" id="noteref-7400" epub:type="noteref">7400</a> He
also wrote to their owner, King Yusuf, a royal Rescript appointing
him Sultan over all the kingdoms that were in and about the
land of Al-Sind; and moreover that whenas the Caliph might
be absent from his good city of Baghdad, Yusuf should take his
place in bidding and forbidding and ordering and governing.
This ended, he despatched the ten slave-girls with a body of his
Chamberlains after giving them wealth galore and of presents and
rarities great store; and they fared forth from him and ceased not
faring till they reached the city of Al-Sind. Now when the ten
handmaidens drew nigh thereto they sent to inform King Yusuf of
their coming, and he commissioned his Wazir Mohammed bin Ibrahim
to meet and receive them, and he caused them enter the Palace,
wondering the while that his ten bondswomen had not found favour
with the Prince of True Believers. So he summoned them to
his presence and asked them thereanent, and they answered by
relating all that had befallen them; and presently Muhjat al-Kulub
presented to him the royal Rescript, and when he read it he
increased in joy and delight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7401" id="noteref-7401" epub:type="noteref">7401</a> Now<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7402" id="noteref-7402" epub:type="noteref">7402</a> when supper was over the
Prince of True Believers said to Ibn Ahyam, “Needs must thou
relate unto us a story which shall solace us;” and said the other,
“O Commander of the Faithful, I have heard a tale touching one
of the Kings.” “What is that?” asked the Caliph, whereupon
Ibn Ahyam fell to relating the adventures of</p>
