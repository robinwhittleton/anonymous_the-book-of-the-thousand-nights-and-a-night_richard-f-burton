  <h2 class="c006">THE TRANSLATOR’S FOREWORD.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010">This volume has been entitled “THE NEW ARABIAN
NIGHTS,” a name now hackneyed because applied to its
contents as far back as 1819 in Henry Weber’s “Tales of
the East,” (Edinburgh, Ballantyne).</p>

<p class="c000">The original MS. was brought to France by Al-Káhin Diyúnisiús
Sháwísh, a Syrian priest of the Congregation of St. Basil,
whose name has been Frenchified to Don Dennis (or Denys)
Chavis. He was a student at the European College of Al-Kadís
Ithanásiús (St. Athanasius) in Rúmiyah the Grand (Constantinople)
and was summoned by the Minister of State, Baron de Breteuil,
to Paris, where he presently became “Teacher of the Arabic
Tongue at the College of the Sultán, King of Fransá in Bárís
(Paris) the Great.” He undertook (probably to supply the loss of
Galland’s ivth MS. volume) a continuation of The Nights (proper),
and wrote with his own hand the last two leaves of the third tome,
which ends with three instead of four couplets: thus he completed
Kamar al-Zamán (Night cclxxxi.–cccxxix.) and the following
tales:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The History of the Sleeper and the Waker (Nights cccxxx.–ccclxxix.).</div>
      <div class="line">The History of Warlock and the Cook (ccclxxx.–cd.).</div>
      <div class="line">The History of the Prisoner in the Bímáristán or Madhouse (cd.–cdxxvii.).</div>
      <div class="line">The History of Ghánim the Thrall o’ Love (cdxxviii.–cdlxxiv.).</div>
      <div class="line">The History of Zayn al-Asnám and the King of the Jánn (cdlxxv.–cdxci.).</div>
      <div class="line">The History of Alaeddin (cdxcii.–dlxix.), and</div>
      <div class="line">The History of Ten Wazirs (dlxx.).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The copy breaks off at folio 320, r<sup>o</sup> in the middle of Night dcxxxi.,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_ii">ii</span>and the date (given at the end of Night cdxxvii., folio 139) is
Shubát (February), A.D. 1787. This is the MS. numbered
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Supplément Arabe</span></cite>, No. 1716.</p>

<p class="c000">In Paris, Dom Chavis forgathered with M. Cazotte, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span>
of the category “light,” an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénieux écrivain</span></i>, distinguished for
“gaiety, delicacy, wit and Attic elegance,” and favorably known
for (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>) his poem “Olivier,” his “Diable Amoureux,”
“The Lord Impromptu,” and a travesty of The Nights called
“The Thousand and One Fopperies.” The two agreed to
collaborate, the Syrian translating the Arabic into French,
and the Parisian metamorphosing the manner and matter to
“the style and taste of the day”; that is to say, working up
an exaggerated imitation, a caricature, of Galland. The work
appeared, according to Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the British Museum, who
kindly sent me these notes, in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Cabinet | des Fées, | ou | Collection

<p class="c000">Of these thirty-four only five (MS. iv., vi., vii., xxvii. and xxxii.)
have not been found in the original Arabic.</p>

<p class="c010">Public opinion was highly favourable to the “Suite” when first
issued. Orientalism was at that time new to Europe, and the
general was startled by its novelties, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> by “Women wearing
drawers and trousers like their husbands, and men arrayed in loose
robes like their wives, yet at the same time cherishing, as so many
goats, each a venerable length of beard.” (Heron’s Preface.) They
found its “phænomena so remote from the customs and manners
of Europe, that, when exhibited as entering into the ordinary
system of human affairs, they could not fail to confer a considerable
share of amusive novelty on the characters and events with
which they were connected.” (Ditto, Preface.) Jonathan Scott
roundly pronounced the continuation a forgery. Dr. Patrick
Russell (History of Aleppo, vol. i. 385) had no good opinion of
it, and Caussin de Perceval (père, vol. viii., p. 40–46) declared the
version <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éloignée du goût Orientale</span></i>; yet he re-translated the tales
from the original Arabic (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Continués</span></i>, Paris, 1806), and in this he
was followed by Gauttier, while Southey borrowed the idea of his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_v">v</span>beautiful romance, Thalaba the Destroyer, now in Lethe from the
“History of Maughraby.” Mr. A. G. Ellis considers these tales as
good as the old “Arabian Nights,” and my friend Mr. W. F. Kirby,
(Appendix to The Nights, vol. x. p. 476), quite agrees with him
that Chavis and Cazotte’s Continuation is well worthy of republication
in its entirety. It remained for the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>,
in one of those ignorant and scurrilous articles with which it
periodically outrages truth and good taste (No. 535, July, 1886),
to state, “Cazotte published his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suite des Mille et une Nuits</span></cite>, a
barefaced forgery, in 1785.” A barefaced forgery! when the
original of twenty-eight tales out of thirty-four are perfectly well
known, and when sundry of these appear in MSS. of “The
Thousand Nights and a Night.”</p>

<p class="c000">The following is a list of the Tales (widely differing from those
of Chavis and Cazotte) which appeared in the version of Caussin
de Perceval.</p>

<p class="c000">I need hardly offer any observations upon these tales, as they
have been discussed in the preceding pages.</p>

<p class="c000">By an error of the late M. Reinaud (for which see p. 39 Histoire
d’ ’Alâ al-Dîn by M. H. Zotenberg, Paris, Imprimerie Nationale,
<span class="fss">MDCCCLXXXVIII</span>,) the MS. <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Supplément Arabe, No. 1716</span></cite>, in the
writing of Dom Chavis has been confounded with No. 1723, which
is not written by the Syrian priest but which contains the originals
of the Cazotte Continuation as noted by M. C. de Perceval (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les
Mille et une Nuits</span></cite>, etc., vol. viii. Préf. p. 17, et seqq.).

quarto measures centimètres 20½ long by 16 wide; the binding
is apparently Italian and the paper is European, but the filegrane
or water-mark, which is of three varieties, a coronet, a lozenge-shaped
bunch of circles and a nondescript, may be Venetian or
French. It contains 765 pages, paginated after European fashion,
but the last eleven leaves are left blank reducing the number
written to 742; and the terminal note, containing the date, is on
the last leaf. Each page numbers 15 lines and each leaf has its
catchword (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot de rappel</span></i>). It is not ordered by “karrás” or
<span class="pageno" id="Page_vii">vii</span>quires; but is written upon 48 sets of 4 double leaves. The text
is in a fair Syrian hand, but not so flowing as that of No. 1716,
by Sháwísh himself, which the well-known Arabist, Baron de
Slane, described as <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bonne écriture orientale de la fin du XVIII<sup>e</sup>
Siècle</span></i>. The colophon conceals or omits the name of the scribe,
but records the dates of incept Kánún II<sup>d</sup>. (the Syrian winter-month
January) A.D. 1772; and of conclusion Naysán (April) of
the same year. It has head-lines disposed recto and verso, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>,</p>

<p class="c000">Upon these tales I would be permitted to offer a few observations.
No. i. begins with a Christian formula:—“In the name of
the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost” (Rúhu’l-Kudus);
and it is not translated, because it is a mere replica of the Ten
<span class="pageno" id="Page_viii">viii</span>Wazirs (Suppl. vol. i. 55–151). The second, containing “The
Sage Haykár,” which is famous in folk-lore throughout the East,
begins with the orthodox Moslem “Bismillah,” etc. “King
Sapor” is prefaced by a Christian form which to the Trinitarian
formula adds, “Allah being One”: this, again, is not translated,
because it repeats the “Ebony Horse” (vol. v. 1). No. iv., which
opens with the Bismillah, is found in the Sabbágh MS. of The
Nights (see Suppl. vol. iii.) as the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Haroun al-Raschid
et de la descendante de Chosroès</span></cite>. <cite>Albondoqani</cite> (Nights lxx.–lxxvii.).
No. v., which also has the Moslem invocation, is followed by
the “Caliph and the Three Kalandars,” where, after the fashion of
this our MS., the episodes (vol. i., 104–130), are taken bodily from
“The Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad” (i. 82), and are converted
into a separate History. No. vi. has no title to be translated,
being a replica of the long sea-tale in vol. vii., 264. Nos.
vii., viii., ix., x. and xi. lack initiatory invocation betraying
Christian or Moslem provenance. No. viii. is the History of
Sí Mustafá and of Shaykh Shaháb al-Dín in the Turkish Tales:
it also occurs in the Sabbágh MS. (Nights ccclxxxvi.–cdviii.). The
Bímáristán (No. ix.), alias Ali Chalabi (Halechalbé), has already
appeared in my Suppl. vol. iv. 49. No. xii., “The Caliph and the
Fisherman,” makes Harun al-Rashid the hero of the tale in “The
Fisherman and the Jinni” (vol. i. 38); it calls the ensorcelled
King of the Black Islands Mahmúd, and his witch of a wife Sitt
al-Mulúk, and it also introduces into the Court of the Great
Caliph Hasan Shumán and Ahmad al-Danaf, the prominent
personages in “The Rogueries of Dalílah” (vol. vii. 144) and its
sister tale (vii. 172). The two last Histories, which are ingenious
enough, also lack initial formulæ.</p>

<p class="c000">The Encyclopedia Britannica (ixth edit. of <span class="fss">MDCCCLXXVI</span>), which
omits the name of Professor Galland, one of the marking Orientalists
in his own day, has not ignored Jacques Cazotte, remarkable
for chequered life and noble death. Born in 1720, at Dijon, where
his father was Chancellor for the Province of Burgundy, he studied
with the Jesuits at home; and, having passed through the finishing
process in Paris, he was introduced to public life by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Administration
de la Marine</span></i>. He showed early taste for poetry as well as
prose, and composed songs, tales, and an opera—the “Thousand
and one Fopperies.” His physique is described as a tall figure,
with regular features, expressive blue eyes, and fine hair, which he
wore long. At twenty-seven he became a commissary in the office
and was presently sent as Comptroller to the Windward Islands,
including the French Colony Martinique, which then as now
was famous for successful woman-kind. At these head quarters he
became intimate with Père Lavalette, Superior of the S. J. Mission,
and he passed some years of a pleasant and not unintellectual
career. Returning to Paris on leave of absence he fell in with a
country-woman and an old family friend, Madame La Poissonnier,
who had been appointed head nurse to the Duke of Burgundy;
and, as the child in her charge required lulling to sleep, Cazotte
composed the favourite <em>romances (ballads)</em>, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tout au beau milieu
des Ardennes</span></i>, and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Commère Il faut chauffer le lit</span></i>. These <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it" xml:lang="it">scherzi</span></i>,
however, brought him more note than profit, and soon afterwards
he returned to Martinique.</p>

<p class="c000">During his second term of service Cazotte wrote his heroic-comic
poem, the Roman d’Olivier, in twelve cantos, afterwards printed
in Paris (2 vols. 8vo, 1765); and it was held a novel and singular
composition. When the English first attacked (in 1759) Saint
<span class="pageno" id="Page_x">x</span>Pierre of Martinique, afterwards captured by Rodney in 1762, the
sprightly <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i> showed abundant courage and conduct, but
over-exertion injured his health, and he was again driven from his
post by sickness. He learned, on landing in France, that his
brother, whilome Vicar-General to M. de Choiseul, Bishop of
Châlons-sur-Marne, had died and left him a fair estate, Pierry,
near Epernay; he therefore resigned his appointment and retired
with the title “Commissary-General to the Marine.” But presently
he lost 50,000 écus—the whole fruit of his economies—by the speculations
of Père Lavalette to whose hands he had entrusted his estates,
negroes, and effects at Martinique. These had been sold and the
cheques had been forwarded to the owner: the S. J., however,
refused to honour them. Hence the scandal of a law-suit in which
Cazotte showed much delicacy and regard for the feelings of his
former tutors.</p>

<p class="c000">Meanwhile Cazotte had married Elizabeth Roignon, daughter
to the Chief Justice of Martinique; he returned to the Parisian world
with some éclat and he became an universal favourite on account
of his happy wit and humour, his bonhomie, his perfect frankness,
and his hearty amiability. The vogue of “Olivier” induced him to
follow it up with <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Diable Amoureux</span></cite>, a continuation or rather
parody of Voltaire’s <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guerre civile de Genève</span></cite>: this work was so
skilfully carried out that it completely deceived the world; and it
was followed by sundry minor pieces which were greedily read.
Unlike the esprits forts of his age, he became after a gay youthtide
an ardent Christian; he made the Gospel his rule of life;
and he sturdily defended his religious opinions; he had also the
moral courage to enter the lists with M. de Voltaire, then the idol-in-chief
of the classes and the masses.</p>

<p class="c000">In later life Cazotte met Dom Chavis, who was translating into a
curious jargon (Arabo-Franco-Italian) certain Oriental tales; and,
although he was nearing the Psalmist’s age-term of man, he
agreed to “collaborate.” The Frenchman used to take the pen
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xi">xi</span>at midnight when returning from “social pleasures,” and work till
4–5 a.m. As he had prodigious facility and spontaneity he finished
his part of the task in two winters. Some of the tales in the suite,
especially that of “Maugraby,” are attributed wholly to his invention;
and, as a rule, his aim and object were to diffuse his spiritual
ideas and to write treatises on moral perfection under the form of
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">novelle</span></i>.</p>

<p class="c000">Cazotte, after a well-spent and honourable life, had reason to
expect with calmness “the evening and ending of a fine day.”
But this was not to be, the Great Revolution had burst like a hurricane
over the land, and he was doomed to die a hero’s death. His
character was too candid, and his disposition too honest, for times
which suggested concealment. He had become one of the Illuminati,
and La Harpe ascribed to him the celebrated prophecy which
described the minutest events of the Great Revolution. A Royalist
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pur sang</span></i>, he freely expressed his sentiments to his old friend Ponteau,
then Secretary of the Civil List. His letters came to light shortly
after the terrible day, August 10, 1792: he was summarily arrested
at Pierry and brought to Paris, where he was thrown into prison.
On Sept. 3, when violence again waxed rampant, he was attacked
by the patriot-assassins, and was saved only by the devotion of his
daughter Elizabeth, who threw herself upon the old man crying,
“You shall not reach my father’s heart before piercing mine.”
The courage of the noble pair commanded the admiration of the
ruffians, and they were carried home in triumph.</p>

<p class="c000">For a few weeks the family remained unmolested, but in those
days “Providence” slept and Fortune did not favour the brave.
The Municipality presently decreed a second arrest, and the venerable
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span>, aged seventy-two, was sent before the revolutionary
tribunal appointed to deal with the pretended offences of August
10. He was subjected to an interrogatory of thirty-six hours,
during which his serenity and presence of mind never abandoned
him and impressed even his accusers. But he was condemned to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xii">xii</span>die for the all-sufficient reason:—“It is not enough to be a good
son, a good husband, a good father, one must also prove oneself a
good citizen.” He spent his last hours with his confessor, wrote
to his wife and children, praying his family not to beweep
him, not to forget him, and never to offend against their God; and
this missive, with a lock of his hair for his beloved daughter, he
finally entrusted to the ghostly father. Upon the scaffold he
turned to the crowd and cried, “I die as I have lived, truthful and
faithful to my God and my King.” His venerable head, crowned
with the white honours of age, fell on Sept. 25, 1792.</p>

<p class="c000">Cazotte printed many works, some of great length, as the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Œuvres Morales</span></cite>, which filled 7 vols, 8vo. in the complete edition of
1817; and the biographers give a long list of publications, besides
those above-mentioned, romantic, ethical, and spiritual, in verse and
in prose. But he wrote mainly for his own pleasure, he never
sought fame, and consequently his reputation never equalled his
merit. His name, however, still smells sweet, passing sweet,
amid the corruption and the frantic fury of his day and the memory
of the witty, genial, and virtuous <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span> still blossoms in the
dust.</p>

<p class="c000">During my visit to Paris in early 1887, M. Hermann Zotenberg
was kind enough to show me the MS., No. 1723, containing
the original tales of the “New Arabian Nights.” As my health
did not allow me sufficient length of stay to complete my translation,
Professor Houdas (for whom, see Appendix, p. 10, Suppl.
vol. iii.) kindly consented to copy the excerpts required, and to
explain the words and phrases which a deficiency of dictionaries
and vocabularies at an outlandish port-town rendered unintelligible
to me.</p>

<p class="c000">In translating a MS., which has never been collated or corrected
and which abounds in errors of omission and commission, I have
been guided by one consideration only, which is, that my first and
chiefest duty to the reader is to make my book readable at the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>same time that it lays before him the whole matter which the text
offered or ought to have offered. Hence I have not hesitated
when necessary to change the order of the sentences, to delete
tautological words and phrases, to suppress descriptions which are
needlessly re-iterated, and in places to supply the connecting links
without which the chain of narrative is weakened or broken.
These are liberties which must be allowed, unless the translator’s
object be to produce a mutilated version of a mutilation.</p>

<p class="c000">Here also I must express my cordial gratitude to Mr. Alexander
J. Cotheal, Consul-General for Nicaragua, in New York. This
distinguished Arabist not only sent to me across the seas his
MS. containing, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, “The Tale of Attaf,” he also undertook
to translate it for my collection upon my distinct assurance that its
many novelties of treatment deserved an especial version. Mr.
W. F. Kirby has again conferred upon my readers an important
service by his storiological notes. Lastly, Dr. Steingass has
lent me, as before, his valuable aid in concluding as he did in
commencing this series, and on putting the colophon to</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE SAY OF HAYKAR THE SAGE.<a id="r6"></a><a href="#f6" class="c011"><sup>[6]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span><b>In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate,
the Eternal One, the Termless, the Timeless, and of Him aidance
we await. And here we begin (with the assistance of Allah Almighty
and His fair furtherance) to indite the Story of Haykar the Sage,
the Philosopher, the Wazir of Sankharib<a id="r7"></a><a href="#f7" class="c011"><sup>[7]</sup></a> the Sovran, and of the
son of the wise man’s sister Nadan<a id="r8"></a><a href="#f8" class="c011"><sup>[8]</sup></a> the Fool.</b></p>

<p class="c010">They relate that during the days of Sankháríb the King, lord
of Asúr<a id="r9"></a><a href="#f9" class="c011"><sup>[9]</sup></a> and Naynawah<a id="r10"></a><a href="#f10" class="c011"><sup>[10]</sup></a> there was a Sage, Haykár hight, Grand
Wazir of that Sovran and his chief secretary, and he was a
grandee of abundant opulence and ampliest livelihood: ware was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>he and wise, a philosopher, and endowed with lore and rede and
experience. Now he had interwedded with threescore wives, for
each and every of which he had builded in his palace her own
bower; natheless he had not a boy to tend, and was he sore of
sorrow therefor. So one day he gathered together the experts,
astrologers and wizards, and related to them his case and complained
of the condition caused by his barrenness. They made
answer to him, “Get thee within and do sacrifice to the Godheads
and enquire of them and implore their favour when haply shall
they vouchsafe unto thee boon of babe.” He did whatso they bade
and set corbans and victims before the images and craved their
assistance, humbling himself with prayer and petition; withal they
vouchsafed to him never a word of reply. So he fared forth in
distress and disappointment and went his ways all disheartened.
Then he returned in his humiliation to Almighty Allah<a id="r11"></a><a href="#f11" class="c011"><sup>[11]</sup></a> and
confided his secret unto Him and called for succour in the burning
of his heart, and cried with a loud voice saying “O God of
Heaven and Earth, O Creator of all creatures, I beg Thee to
vouchsafe unto me a son wherewith I may console my old age and
who may become my heir, after being present at my death and
closing my eyes and burying my body.” Hereat came a Voice
from Heaven which said, “Inasmuch as at first thou trustedst in
graven images and offeredst to them victims, so shalt thou remain
childless, lacking sons and daughters. However, get thee up and
take to thee Nádán, thy sister’s child; and, after taking this nephew
to son, do thou inform him with thy learning and thy good breeding
and thy sagesse, and demise to him that he inherit of thee after
thy decease.” Hereupon the Sage adopted his nephew Nadan,
who was then young in years and a suckling, that he might teach
him and train him; so he entrusted him to eight wet-nurses and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>dry-nurses for feeding and rearing, and they brought him up on
diet the choicest with delicatest nurture and clothed him with
sendal and escarlate<a id="r12"></a><a href="#f12" class="c011"><sup>[12]</sup></a> and dresses dyed with Alkermes,<a id="r13"></a><a href="#f13" class="c011"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and his
sitting was upon shag-piled rugs of silk. But when Nadan grew
great and walked and shot up even as the lofty Cedar<a id="r14"></a><a href="#f14" class="c011"><sup>[14]</sup></a> of Lebanon,
his uncle taught him deportment and writing and reading<a id="r15"></a><a href="#f15" class="c011"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and
philosophy and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">omne scibile</span></i>. Now after a few days Sankharib
the King looked upon Haykar and saw how that he had waxed
an old old man, so quoth he to him, “Ho thou excellent companion,<a id="r16"></a><a href="#f16" class="c011"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
the generous, the ingenious, the judicious, the sagacious,
the Sage, my Secretary and my Minister and the Concealer of my
secrets and the Councillor of my kingdom, seeing how so it be
that thou art aged and well shotten in years and nigh unto thy
death and decease, so tell me<a id="r17"></a><a href="#f17" class="c011"><sup>[17]</sup></a> who shall stand in my service
after thy demise?” Made answer Haykar, “O my lord the King,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>may thy head live for ever and aye! that same shall be this
Nadan, son to my sister, whom I have taken to myself as mine own
child and have reared him and have taught him my learning and
my experience, all thereof.” “Bring him to the presence,” quoth
the King, “and set him between my hands, that I look upon him;
and, if I find him fitting, I will stablish him in thy stead. Then
do thou wend thy ways and off-go from office that thou take thy
rest and tend thine old age, living the lave of thy life in the fairest
of honour.” Hereupon Haykar hied him home and carried his
nephew Nadan before the King, who considered him and was
pleased with the highmost of pleasure and, rejoicing in him,
presently asked the uncle, “Be this thine adopted son, O
Haykar? I pray Allah preserve him; and, even as thou
servedst my sire Sarhádún<a id="r18"></a><a href="#f18" class="c011"><sup>[18]</sup></a> before me, even so shall this thy
son do me suite and service and fulfil my affairs and my
needs and my works, to the end that I may honour him and
advance him for the sake of thee.” Thereat Haykar prostrated
himself before the presence and said, “May thy head live, O my
lord, for evermore! I desire of thee to extend the wings of thy
spirit over him for that he is my son, and do thou be clement to
his errings, so that he may serve thee as besitteth.” The King
forthwith made oath that he would stablish the youth amongst
the highmost of his friends and the most worshipful of his
familiars and that he should abide with him in all respect
and reverence. So Haykar kissed the royal hands and blessed his
lord; then, taking with him Nadan his nephew, he seated him in
privacy and fell to teaching him by night as well as by day, that
he might fill him with wisdom and learning rather than with meat
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>and drink; and he would address him in these terms.<a id="r19"></a><a href="#f19" class="c011"><sup>[19]</sup></a> “O dear
my son,<a id="r20"></a><a href="#f20" class="c011"><sup>[20]</sup></a> if a word come to thine ears, suffer it to die within thy
heart nor ever disclose it unto other, lest haply it become a live
coal<a id="r21"></a><a href="#f21" class="c011"><sup>[21]</sup></a> to burn up thy tongue and breed pain in thy body and clothe
thee in shame and gar thee despised of God and man. O dear my
son, an thou hear a report reveal it not, and if thou behold a thing
relate it not. O dear my son, make easy thine address unto thine
hearers, and be not hasty in return of reply. O dear my son, desire
not formal beauty which fadeth and vadeth while fair report
endureth unto infinity. O dear my son, be not deceived by a
woman immodest of speech lest her snares waylay thee<a id="r22"></a><a href="#f22" class="c011"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and in
her springes thou become a prey and thou die by ignominious
death. O dear my son, hanker not after a woman adulterated by
art, such as clothes and cosmetics, who is of nature bold and
immodest, and beware lest thou obey her and give her aught that
is not thine and entrust to her even that which is in thy hand, for
she will robe thee in sin and Allah shall become wroth with thee.
O dear my son, be not like unto the almond-tree<a id="r23"></a><a href="#f23" class="c011"><sup>[23]</sup></a> which leafeth
earlier than every growth and withal is ever of the latest to fruit;
but strive to resemble the mulberry-tree which beareth food the
first of all growths and is the last of any to put forth her foliage.<a id="r24"></a><a href="#f24" class="c011"><sup>[24]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>O dear my son, bow thy head before thine inferior and soften
thine utterance and be courteous and tread in the paths of piety,
and shun impudence and louden not thy voice whenas thou
speakest or laughest; for, were a house to be builded by volume of
sound, the ass would edify many a mansion every day.<a id="r25"></a><a href="#f25" class="c011"><sup>[25]</sup></a> O dear
my son, the transport of stones with a man of wisdom is better
than the drinking of wine with one blamed for folly. O dear my
son, rather pour out thy wine upon the tombs of the pious than
drain it with those who give offence by their insolence. O dear my
son, cleave to the sage that is Allah-fearing and strive to resemble
him, and approach not the fool lest thou become like unto him
and learn his foolish ways. O dear my son, whenas thou affectest
a friend or a familiar, make trial of him and then company with him,
and without such test nor praise him nor divulge thy thoughts unto
one who is other than wise. O dear my son, as long as thy boot is
upon thy leg and foot, walk therewith over the thorns and tread a
way for thy sons and thy sons’ sons; and build thee a boat ere the
sea break into billows and breakers and drown thee before thou
find an ark of safety. O dear my son, when the richard eateth a
snake, folks shall say that ’tis of his subtilty; but when a pauper
feedeth upon it, the world shall declare ’tis of his poverty. O dear
my son, be content with thy grade and thy good, nor covet aught
of thy fellow. O dear my son, be not neighbourly with the ignorant
nor do thou break with him bread, and joy not in the annoy of
those about thee and when thy foe shall maltreat thee meet him
with beneficence. O dear my son, fear the man who feareth not
Allah and hold him in hate. O dear my son, the fool shall fall
when he trippeth; but the wise man when he stumbleth shall not
tumble, and if he come to the ground he shall rise up quickly, and
when he sickeneth he shall readily heal himself, whereas to the
malady of the ignorant and the stupid there is no remedy. O dear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>my son, when a man lesser than thyself shall accost thee, prevent him
in standing respectfully before him, and if he suffice thee not the
Lord shall suffice thee in his stead. O dear my son, spare not blows
to thy child,<a id="r26"></a><a href="#f26" class="c011"><sup>[26]</sup></a> for the beating of the boy is like manuring to the
garden and binding to the purse-mouth and tethering to the cattle
and locking to the door. O dear my son, withhold thy child from
wickedness, and discipline him ere he wax great and become contumacious
to thee, thus belittling thee amongst thine equals and
lowering thy head upon the highways and in the assemblies, and
thou be described as an aider in his wrongous works. O dear
my son, let no word escape thy lips without consulting thy heart;
nor stand up between two adversaries, for out of converse with the
wicked cometh enmity, and from enmity is bred battle, and from
battle ariseth slaughter, when thy testimony shall be required;
nay, do thou fly therefrom and be at rest. O dear my son, stand
not up against one stronger than thyself; but possess thy soul
in patience and long-suffering and forbearance and pacing the
paths of piety, for than this naught is more excellent. O dear my
son, exult not over the death of thy enemy by cause that after a
little while thou shalt become his neighbour. O dear my son, turn
thou a deaf ear to whoso jeereth thee, and honour him and forego
him with the salam-salutation. O dear my son, whenas the water
shall stand still in stream and the bird shall fly sky-high and the
black raven shall whiten and myrrh shall wax honey-sweet, then
will the ignorant and the fool comprehend and converse. O dear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>my son, an thou would be wise restrain thy tongue from leasing
and thy hand from thieving and thine eyes from evil glancing;
and then, and then only, shalt thou be called a sage. O dear my
son, suffer the wise man strike thee with his staff rather than the
fool anoint thee with his sweetest unguent.<a id="r27"></a><a href="#f27" class="c011"><sup>[27]</sup></a> O dear my son, be thou
humble in thy years of youth, that thou may be honoured in thine
old age. O dear my son, stand not up against a man in office and
puissance nor against a river in its violence, and haste not in matters
of marriage; for, an this bring weal, folk will not appraise thee and
if ill they will abuse thee and curse thee. O dear my son, company
with one who hath his hand fulfilled and well-furnisht and associate
not with any whose hand is fist-like and famisht. O dear my son,
there be four things without stability: a king and no army,<a id="r28"></a><a href="#f28" class="c011"><sup>[28]</sup></a> a
Wazir in difficulty for lack of rede; amongst the folks villany and
over the lieges tyranny. Four things also may not be hidden; to
wit, the sage and the fool, the richard and the pauper.”<a id="r29"></a><a href="#f29" class="c011"><sup>[29]</sup></a> Now when
Haykar had made an end of these injunctions and instances addrest
to Nadan his nephew, he fondly deemed in mind that the youth
would bear in memory all his charges, and he wist not that the
clean contrary thereof to him would become manifest. After this
the older Minister sat in peace at home and committed to the
younger all his moneys and his negro slaves and his concubines;
his horses and camels, his flocks and herds, and all other such
whereof he was seised. Also bidding and forbiddal were left in the
youth’s hand and he was promoted and preferred by the monarch
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>like his maternal uncle and even more, whilst the ex-Wazir took
his rest in retirement, nor was it his habit to visit the King save
once after a while, when he would fare forth to salute him with the
salam and forthwith return home. But when Nadan made sure of
all commandment being in his own hand, he jeered in public at his
uncle and raised his nose at him and fell to blaming him whenever
he made act of presence and would say, “Verily Haykar is in age
and dotage and no more he wotteth one thing from other thing.”
Furthermore he fell to beating the negro slaves and the handmaidens,
and to vending the steeds and dromedaries and applied
him wilfully to waste all that appertained to his uncle who, when
he saw this lack of ruth for the chattels and the household, incontinently
drove him ignominiously from his place. Moreover he sent
to apprize the King thereof; to wit, that he would assuredly<a id="r30"></a><a href="#f30" class="c011"><sup>[30]</sup></a>
resume all his belongings and provision; and his liege, summoning
Nadan, said to him, “So long as Haykar shall be in life, let none
lord it over his household or meddle with his fortune.” On this
wise the youth’s hand was stayed from his uncle and from all his
good and he ceased to go in to him and come out from him, and
even to accost him with the salam. Presently Haykar repented of
the pains and the trouble he had taken with Nadan and he became
perplext exceedingly. Now the youth had a younger brother,
Naudan<a id="r31"></a><a href="#f31" class="c011"><sup>[31]</sup></a> hight, so Haykar adopted him in lieu of the other and
tendered him and honoured him with highmost honour and committed
to him all his possessions and created him comptroller of his
household and of his affairs. But when the elder brother beheld
what had betided him, he was seized with envy and jealousy and
he fell to complaining before all who questioned him, deriding his
benefactor; and he would say, “Verily my maternal uncle hath
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>driven me from his doors and hath preferred my brother before me;
but, an Almighty Allah empower me, I will indeed cast him into
doom of death.” Hereat he fell to brooding over the ruin of his
relative, and after a long while he went, one day of the days, and
wrote a letter to Akhyash Abná Sháh,<a id="r32"></a><a href="#f32" class="c011"><sup>[32]</sup></a> physician to the King of
Persia and ’Ajam or Barbaria-land, and the following were its contents.
“All salams that befit and greetings that are meet from part
of Sankharib, King of Assyria and Niniveh, and from his Wazir
and Secretary Haykar unto thee, O glorious monarch, and salutations
be betwixt me and thee. And forthright, when this missive
shall have reached thee, do thou arise in haste and come to meet
me and let our trysting-place be the Buk’at Nisrín, the lowland of
the Eglantine<a id="r33"></a><a href="#f33" class="c011"><sup>[33]</sup></a> of Assyria and Niniveh, that I may commit to
thee the kingdom sans fight or fray.” Furthermore he wrote a
second letter in Haykar’s name to Pharaoh,<a id="r34"></a><a href="#f34" class="c011"><sup>[34]</sup></a> lord of Misraim,<a id="r35"></a><a href="#f35" class="c011"><sup>[35]</sup></a>
with this purport:—<a id="r36"></a><a href="#f36" class="c011"><sup>[36]</sup></a>“Greetings between me and thee, O mighty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>potentate; and do thou straightway, on receipt of this epistle,
arise and march upon the Buk’at Nisrin to the end that I make
over to thee the kingdom without battle or slaughter.” Now
Nadan’s handwriting was the likest to that of his mother’s brother.
Then he folded the two missives and sealed them with Haykar’s
signet and cast them into the royal palace, after which he went
and indited a letter in the King’s name to his uncle, saying:—“All
salutations to my Wazir and Secretary and Concealer of my
secret, Haykar; and do thou forthright on receipt of this present
levy thy host and all that be under thee with arms and armour
complete, and march them to meet me on fifth-day<a id="r37"></a><a href="#f37" class="c011"><sup>[37]</sup></a> at the Buk’at
Nisrin. Moreover, when thou see me approach thee make thy
many prepare for mimic onset as they were my adversaries and
offer me sham fight; for that messengers from Pharaoh, King
of Egypt, have been sent to espy the strength of our armies.
Accordingly, let them stand in fear of us, for that they be our foes
and our haters.” Presently, sealing this epistle, he sent it to
Haykar by one of the royal pages and himself carrying the other
letters he had addressed to the Persian and the Egyptian, he laid
them before the King and read them aloud and showed their seals.
But when Sankharib heard their contents he marvelled with mighty
great marvel and raged with exceeding rage and cried out, saying,
“What is it I have done unto Haykar that he should write such a
writ to mine adversaries? Is this my reward for all the benefits
I have lavished upon Haykar?” The other replied, “Be not
grieved, O King, and sorrow not, nor be thou an-angered: rather
let us fare on the morrow to the Buk’at Nisrin and look into the
matter, whether it be fact or falsehood.” So when Thursday came,
Nadan arose, and taking the King and his Wazirs and army-officers
marched them over the wastes to the Lowland of the Eglantine,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>and arrived there Sankharib, the Sovran, looked upon Haykar and
saw his host aligned in battle against himself. And when the
ex-Minister beheld his King approaching, he bade his host stir for
battle and prepare to smite the opposing ranks; to wit, those of
his liege lord, even as he had been commanded by royal rescript,
nor did he ken what manner of pit had been digged for him by
Nadan. But seeing this sight the monarch was agitated and
consterned and raged with mighty great wrath. Then quoth
Nadan, “Seest thou, O King, what this sorry fellow hath done?
But chafe not, neither be thou sorrowful, but rather do thou retire
to thy palace, whither I will presently bring to thee Haykar
pinioned and bearing chains; and I will readily and without
trouble fend off from thee thy foe.” So when Sankharib hied him
home in sore anger with that which his ancient Minister had done,
Nadan went to his uncle and said, “Indeed the King hath rejoiced
with exceeding joy, and thanketh thee for acting as he bade thee,
and now he hath despatched me to order that thy men be bidden
to wend their ways, and that thou present thyself before him
pinioned and fettered to the end that thou be seen in such plight
of the envoys sent by Pharaoh concerning whom and whose master
our Monarch standeth in fear.” “To hear is to obey!” replied
Haykar, and forthwith let pinion his arms and fetter his legs;
then, taking with him Nadan, his nephew, he repaired to the
presence, where he found the King perusing the other forged
letter also sealed with the ministerial signet. When he entered
the throne-room he prostrated himself, falling to the ground upon
his face, and the Sovran said to him “O Haykar, my Viceregent
and Secretary and Concealer of my secret and Councillor of my
kingdom, say me, what have I wrought thee of wrong that thou
shouldst requite me with such hideous deed?” So saying he
showed him the two papers written in the handwriting and sealed
with the seal of the accused who, when he looked upon them,
trembled in every limb, and his tongue was knotted for a while,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>nor could he find power to speak a word, and he was reft of all
his reason and of his knowledge. Wherefor he bowed his brow
groundwards and held his peace. But when the King beheld this
his condition, he bade them slay him by smiting his neck without
the city, and Nadan cried aloud, “O Haykar, O blackavice, what
could have profited thee such trick and treason that thou do a
deed like this by thy King?”<a id="r38"></a><a href="#f38" class="c011"><sup>[38]</sup></a> Now the name of the Sworder
was Abú Sumayk the Pauper,<a id="r39"></a><a href="#f39" class="c011"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and the monarch bade him strike
the neck of Haykar in front of the Minister’s house-door and place
his head at a distance of an hundred ells from his body.<a id="r40"></a><a href="#f40" class="c011"><sup>[40]</sup></a> Hearing
this Haykar fell prone before the King and cried, “Live thou, O
my lord the King, for ever and aye! An thou desire my death
be it as thou wilt and well I wot that I am not in default and that
the evil-doer exacteth according to his ill-nature.<a id="r41"></a><a href="#f41" class="c011"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Yet I hope
from my lord the King and from his benevolence that he suffer the
Sworder make over my corpse to my menials for burial, and so
shall thy slave be thy sacrifice.” Hereat the Monarch commanded
the Headsman do as he was desired, and the man, accompanied
by the royal pages, took Haykar, whom they had stripped of his
outer raiment, and led him away to execution. But when he was
certified of coming death, he sent tidings thereof to his wife,
Shaghaftíní<a id="r42"></a><a href="#f42" class="c011"><sup>[42]</sup></a> hight, adding, “Do thou forthright come forth to
meet me escorted by a thousand maiden girls, whom thou shalt
habit in escarlate and sendal, that they may keen over me ere I
perish; moreover dispread for the Headsman and his varlets a table
of food and bring an abundance of good wine that they may drink
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>and make merry.”<a id="r43"></a><a href="#f43" class="c011"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Haykar’s wife presently obeyed his orders for
she also was ware and wise, sharp-witted, experienced and a
compendium of accomplishments and knowledge. Now when the
guards<a id="r44"></a><a href="#f44" class="c011"><sup>[44]</sup></a> and the Sworder and his varlets came to Haykar’s door,
they found the tables laid out with wine and sumptuous viands;
so they fell to eating and drinking till they had their sufficiency
and returned thanks to the housemaster.<a id="r45"></a><a href="#f45" class="c011"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Thereupon Haykar led
the Headsman aside into privacy and said to him, “O Abu
Sumayk,<a id="r46"></a><a href="#f46" class="c011"><sup>[46]</sup></a> what while Sarhadun the King, sire of Sankharib the
King, determined to slay thee, I took thee and hid thee in a place
unknown to any until the Sovran sent for thee. Moreover I cooled
his temper every day till he was pleased to summon thee, and when
at last I set thee in his presence he rejoiced in thee. Therefore do
thou likewise at this moment bear in mind the benefits I wrought
thee, and well I wot that the King will repent him for my sake
and will be wroth with exceeding wrath for my slaughter, seeing
that I be guiltless; so when thou shalt bring me alive before him
thy degree shall become of the highest. For know thou that
Nadan my nephew hath betrayed me and devised for me this ill
device; and I repeat that doubtless my lord will presently rue my
ruin. Learn, too, that beneath the threshold of my mansion lieth
a souterrain whereof no man is ware: so do thou conceal me
therein with the connivance of my spouse Shaghaftini. Also I
have in my prison a slave which meriteth doom of death:<a id="r47"></a><a href="#f47" class="c011"><sup>[47]</sup></a> so
bring him forth and robe him in my robes; then bid the varlets
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>(they being drunken with wine) do him die, nor shall they know
whom they have slain. And lastly command them to remove his
head an hundred cubits from his body and commit the corpse unto
my chattels that they inter it. So shalt thou store up with me this
rich treasure of goodly deeds.” Hereupon the Sworder did as he
was bidden by his ancient benefactor, and he and his men repairing
to the presence said, “Live thy head, O King, for ever and aye!”<a id="r48"></a><a href="#f48" class="c011"><sup>[48]</sup></a>
And after this Shaghaftini, the wife of Haykar, brought meat and
drink to her husband down in the Matamor,<a id="r49"></a><a href="#f49" class="c011"><sup>[49]</sup></a> and every Friday she
would provide him with a sufficiency for the following week without
the weeting of anyone. Presently the report was spread and
published and bruited abroad throughout Assyria and Niniveh
how Haykar the Sage had been done to die and slain by his
Sovran; and the lieges of all those regions, one and all, keened<a id="r50"></a><a href="#f50" class="c011"><sup>[50]</sup></a>
for him aloud and shed tears and said, “Alas for thee, O Haykar,
and alack for the loss of thy lore and thy knowledge! Woe be to
us for thee and for thy experience! Where now remaineth to find
thy like? where now shall one intelligent, understanding and
righteous of rede resemble thee and stand in thy stead?”
Presently the King fell to regretting the fate of Haykar whereof
repentance availed him naught: so he summoned Nadan and said
to him, “Fare forth and take with thee all thy friends to keen and
make ceremonious wailings for thy maternal uncle Haykar and
mourn, according to custom, in honour of him and his memory.”
But Nadan, the fool, the ignorant, the hard of heart, going forth
the presence to show sorrow at his uncle’s house, would neither
mourn nor weep nor keen; nay, in lieu thereof he gathered
together lewd fellows and fornicators who fell to feasting and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>carousing. After this he took to himself the concubines and slaves
belonging to his uncle, whom he would scourge and bastinado with
painful beating; nor had he any shame before the wife of his
adopted father who had entreated him as her son; but solicited
her sinfully to lie with him. On the other hand Haykar, who
lay perdu in his Silo, ever praised Allah the Compassionate,<a id="r51"></a><a href="#f51" class="c011"><sup>[51]</sup></a> and
returned thanks unto Him for saving his life and was constant in
gratitude and instant in prayer and in humbling himself before
God. At times after due intervals the Sworder would call upon
him to do him honour due and procure him pleasure, after which
he would pray for his release and forthright gang his gait. Now
when the bruit spread abroad over all the lands how that
Haykar the Wise had been done to die, the rulers everywhere
rejoiced, exulting in the distress of King Sankharib who sorely
regretted the loss of his Sage. Presently, awaiting the fittest
season, the Monarch of Misraim arose and wrote a writ to
the Sovran of Assyria and Niniveh of the following tenor:—“After
salams that befit and salutations that be meet and
congratulation and veneration complete wherewith I fain
distinguish my beloved brother Sankharib the King, I would
have thee know that I am about to build a bower in the air
between firmament and terra firma; and I desire thee on thy
part to send me a man which is wise, a tried and an experienced,
that he may help me to edify the same: also that he make answer
to all the problems and profound questions I shall propose, otherwise
thou shalt deposit with me the taxes in kind<a id="r52"></a><a href="#f52" class="c011"><sup>[52]</sup></a> of Assyria and
Nineveh and their money-tributes for three years.” Then he made
an end of his writ and, sealing it with his signet-ring, sent it to its
<span class="pageno" id="Page_19">19</span>destination. But when the missive reached Sankharib, he took it
and read it, he and his Wazirs and the Lords of his land; and all
stood perplext thereat and sore confounded; whilst the King
waxed furious with excessive fury, and he was distraught as to
what he should do and how he should act. Anon, however, he
gathered together all the Shaykhs and Elders and the Olema and
doctors of law and the physicists and philosophers and the
charmers<a id="r53"></a><a href="#f53" class="c011"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and the astrologers and all such persons which were in
his realm, and he let read the epistle of Pharaoh in their presence.
Then he asked them, saying, “Who amongst you shall repair to
the court of Pharaoh, lord of Misraim, and reply to his interrogations?”
But they cried, “O our lord the King, do thou know
there be no one who can loose the knot of these difficulties save
only thy Wazir Haykar; and now that none shall offer an answer
save Nadan, the son of his sister, whom he hath informed with all
his subtilty and his science. Therefore, do thou summon him and
haply he shall unravel for thee a tangled skein so hard to untwist.”
Sankharib did as they advised, and when Nadan appeared in the
presence said to him, “Look thou upon this writ and comprehend
its contents.” But when the youth read it he said to the Sovran,
“O my lord the King, leave alone this folk for they point to
impossibilities: what man can base a bower upon air between
heaven and earth?” As soon as King Sankharib heard these words
of Nadan, he cried out with a mighty outcry and a violent; then,
stepping down from his throne, he sat upon ashes<a id="r54"></a><a href="#f54" class="c011"><sup>[54]</sup></a> and fell to
beweeping and bewailing the loss of Haykar and crying, “Alas,
for me and woe worth the day for thee, O Caretaker of my capital
and Councillor of my kingdom! Where shall I find one like
<span class="pageno" id="Page_20">20</span>unto thee, O Haykar? Harrow now for me, O Haykar, Oh
Saviour of my secret and Manifester of my moot-points,
where now shall I fare to find thee? Woe is me for sake
of thee whom I slew and destroyed at the word of a silly
boy! To him indeed who could bring Haykar before me or who
could give me the glad tidings of Haykar being on life, I would
give the half of my good; nay, the moiety of my realm. But
whence can this come? Ah me, O Haykar; happy was he who
looked upon thee in life that he might take his sufficiency of thy
semblance and fortify himself<a id="r55"></a><a href="#f55" class="c011"><sup>[55]</sup></a> therefrom. Oh my sorrow for thee
to all time! Oh my regret and remorse for thee and for slaying
thee in haste and for not delaying thy death till I had considered
the consequence of such misdeed.” And the King persisted in
weeping and wailing night and day on such wise. But when the
Sworder<a id="r56"></a><a href="#f56" class="c011"><sup>[56]</sup></a> beheld the passion of his lord and his yearning and his
calling upon Haykar, he came to the presence and prostrated
himself and said, “O my lord, bid thy varlets strike off my head!”
Quoth the Monarch, “Woe to thee, what be thy sin?” and quoth
the Headsman, “O my lord, what slave ever contrarieth the
command of his master let the same be slain, and I verily have
broken thy behest.” The King continued, “Fie upon thee,<a id="r57"></a><a href="#f57" class="c011"><sup>[57]</sup></a> O
Abu Sumayk, wherein hast thou gainsaid me?” and the other
rejoined, “O my lord, thou badest me slay the Sage Haykar; but
well I wotted that right soon indeed thou wouldst regret the death
of him, and the more so for that he was a wronged man; accordingly
I fared forth from thee and hid him in a place unbeknown
to any and I slew one of his slaves in his stead. And at this moment
Haykar is alive and well; and if thou bid me, I will bring him
<span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>before thee when, if thou be so minded, do thou put me to death,
otherwise grant me immunity.” Cried the King, “Fie upon thee,
O Abu Sumayk, how durst thou at such time make mock of me,
I being thy lord?” but the Sworder replied, “By thy life and the
life of thy head, O my lord, I swear that Haykar is alive and in
good case!” Now when the Monarch heard these words from the
Sworder and was certified by him of the matter, he flew for very
gladness and he was like to fall a-swoon for the violence of his joy.
So he bade forthright Haykar be brought to him and exclaimed to
the Sworder, “O thou righteous slave an this thy say be soothfast,
I am resolved to enrich thee and raise thy degree amongst all my
companions;” and so saying and rejoicing mightily he commanded
the Sworder set Haykar in the presence. The man
fared to the Minister’s house forthright, and opening the souterrain
went downstairs to the tenant whom he found sitting and praising
Allah and rendering to Him thanksgivings; so he cried out and
said, “O Haykar, the blessedest of bliss hath come to thee, and
do thou go forth and gladden thy heart!” Haykar replied, “And
what is to do?” whereat the man told him the whole tale, first
and last, of what had befallen his lord at the hands of Pharaoh;
then, taking him, led him to the presence. But when Sankharib
considered him, he found him as one clean wasted by want; his
hair had grown long like the pelts of wild beasts and his nails
were as vulture’s claws and his members were meagre for the
length of time spent by him in duresse and darkness, and the dust
had settled upon him and changed his colour which had faded
and waxed of ashen hue. So his lord mourned for his plight and,
rising up in honour, kissed him and embraced him and wept over
him saying, “Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord—who hath restored
thee to me on life after death!” Then he fell to soothing his
sorrows and consoled him, praying pardon of him the while;
and after bestowing robes of honour upon the Sworder and giving
him due guerdon and lavishing upon him abundant good, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>busied himself about the recovery of Haykar, who said, “O my
lord the King, may thy head live for ever and aye! All this
wrong which befel me is the work of the adulterines, and I reared
me a palm-tree against which I might prop me, but it bent and
brought me to the ground: now, however, O my lord and master,
that thou hast deigned summon me before thee, may all passion
pass away and dolour depart from thee!” “Blessed and exalted be
Allah,” rejoined Sankharib, “who hath had ruth upon thee, and
who, seeing and knowing thee to be a wronged man, hath saved
thee and preserved thee from slaughter.<a id="r58"></a><a href="#f58" class="c011"><sup>[58]</sup></a> Now, however, do thou
repair to the Hammam and let shave thy head and pare thy nails
and change thy clothes; after which sit at home in ease for forty
days’ space that thy health be restored and thy condition be righted
and the hue of health return to thy face; and then (but not till
then) do thou appear before me.” Hereupon the King invested
him with sumptuous robes, and Haykar, having offered thanks to
his liege lord, fared homewards in joyaunce and gladness frequently
ejaculating, “Subhána ’llahu ta’álà—God Almighty be glorified!”
and right happy were his household and his friends and all who
learned that he was still on life. Then did he as the King had
bidden him and enjoyed his rest for two-score days, after which
he donned his finest dress and took horse, followed and preceded
by his slaves, all happy and exulting, and rode to Court, while
Nadan the nephew, seeing what had befallen, was seized with sore
fear and affright and became perplexed and unknowing what to
do. Now, when Haykar went in and salamed to the King, his
lord seated him by his side and said, “O my beloved Haykar, look
upon this writ which was sent to me by the King of Misraim after
hearing of thy execution; and in very deed they; to wit he and
his, have conquered and chastised and routed most of the folk of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>our realm, compelling them to fly for refuge Egyptwards in fear of
the tax-tribute which they have demanded of us.” So the
Minister took the missive and, after reading and comprehending
the sum of its contents, quoth he to the King, “Be not wroth, O
my lord: I will repair in person to Egypt and will return a full
and sufficient reply to Pharaoh, and I will explain to him his
propositions and will bring thee from him all the tax-tribute he
demandeth of thee: moreover, I will restore all the lieges he hath
caused fly this country and I will humiliate every foe of thee by
aidance of Almighty Allah and by the blessings of thy Majesty.”
Now when the Sovran heard this answer, he rejoiced and his
heart was gladdened; whereupon he gifted Haykar with a generous
hand and once more gave immense wealth to the Sworder.
Presently the Minister said, “Grant me a delay of forty days that
I ponder this matter and devise a sufficient device.” As soon as
Sankharib granted him the required permission he returned homewards
and, summoning his huntsmen, bade them catch for him two
vigorous young vultures;<a id="r59"></a><a href="#f59" class="c011"><sup>[59]</sup></a> and, when these were brought, he sent
for those who twist ropes and commanded them make two cords
of cotton each measuring two thousand ells. He also bade bring
him carpenters and ordered them to build for him two coffers of
large size, and as soon as his bidding was done he chose out two
little lads, one hight Binúhál and the other Tabshálím.<a id="r60"></a><a href="#f60" class="c011"><sup>[60]</sup></a> Then
every day he would let slaughter a pair of lambs and therewith
feed the children and the vultures, and he mounted those upon
the back of these, binding them tight, and also making fast the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_24">24</span>cords to the legs of the fowls. He would then allow the birds to
rise little by little, prolonging the flight every day to the extent
of ten cubits, the better to teach and to train them; and they
learnt their task so well that in a short time they would rise to
the full length of the tethers till they soared in the fields of air
with the boys on their backs, after which he would let hale them
down. And when he saw them perfect in this process, he taught
the lads to utter loud shouts what while they reached the
full length of the cords and to cry out, “Send us stones and mud<a id="r61"></a><a href="#f61" class="c011"><sup>[61]</sup></a>
and slaked lime that we may build a bower for King Pharaoh,
inasmuch as we now stand here all the day idle!” And Haykar
ceased not to accustom them and to instruct them until they
became dexterous in such doings as they could be. Then he
quitted them and presenting himself before King Sankharib said,
“O my lord, the work is completed even as thou couldst desire;
but do thou arise and come with me that I may show thee the
marvel.” Thereupon the King and his courtiers accompanied
Haykar to a wide open space outside the city whither he sent for
the vultures and the lads; and after binding the cords he loosed
them to soar as high as the lanyards allowed in the firmament-plain,
when they fell to outcrying as he had taught them. And lastly he
haled them in and restored them to their steads. Hereat the King
wondered, as did all his suite, with extreme wonderment, and
kissing his Minister between his eyes, robed him in an honourable
robe and said to him, “Go forth in safety, O my beloved,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>and boast of my realm, to the land of Egypt<a id="r62"></a><a href="#f62" class="c011"><sup>[62]</sup></a> and answer the
propositions of Pharaoh and master him by the power of Almighty
Allah;” and with these words farewelled him. Accordingly
Haykar took his troops and guards, together with the lads and the
vultures, and he fared forth intending for Egypt where on arrival
he at once made for the royal Palace. And when the folk of the
capital understood that Sankharib the King had commissioned a
man of his notables to bespeak their Sovran the Pharaoh, they
entered and apprized their liege lord who sent a party of his
familiars summoning him to the presence. Presently Haykar the
Sage entered unto Pharaoh; and after prostration as befitteth
before royalty said, “O my lord, Sankharib the King greeteth
thee with many salutations and salams; and hath sent me single-handed
sans other of his slaves, to the end that I answer thy
question and fulfil whatso thou requirest, and I am commanded to
supply everything thou needest; especially inasmuch as thou hast
sent to the Monarch my master for the loan of a man who can
build thee a bower between firmament and terra firma; and I, by
the good aidance of Allah Almighty and of thine august magnanimity,
will edify that same for thee even as thou desirest and
requirest. But this shall be upon the condition stablished concerning
the tax-tribute of Misraim for three years, seeing that the
consent of the Kings be their fullest securities. An thou vanquish
me and my hand fall short and I fail to answer thee, then shall my
liege lord send thee the tax-tribute whereof thou speakest; but if
I bring thee all thou needest, then shalt thou forward to my lord
the tax-tribute thou hast mentioned and of him demanded.”
Pharaoh, hearing these words, marvelled and was perplexed at the
eloquence of his tongue and the sweetness of his speech and presently
exclaimed, “O man, what may be thy name?” The other
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>replied, “Thy slave is hight Abíkám;<a id="r63"></a><a href="#f63" class="c011"><sup>[63]</sup></a> and I am an emmet of the
emmets under Sankharib the King.” Asked Pharaoh, “Had not
thy lord one more dignified of degree than thou, that he send unto
me an ant to answer me and converse with me?” and Haykar
answered, “I humbly hope of the Almighty that I may satisfy all
which is in thy heart, O my lord; for that Allah is with the weakling
the more to astound the strongling.” Hereat Pharaoh gave
orders to set apart for Abikam his guest an apartment, also for
the guards and all that were with him and provide them with
rations and fodder of meat and drink, and whatso was appropriate
to their reception as properest might be. And after the usual
three days of guest-rite<a id="r64"></a><a href="#f64" class="c011"><sup>[64]</sup></a> the King of Egypt donned his robes
of brightest escarlate; and, having taken seat upon his throne,
each and every Grandee and Wazir (who were habited in the
same hue) standing with crossed arms and feet joined,<a id="r65"></a><a href="#f65" class="c011"><sup>[65]</sup></a> he sent a
summons to produce before him Haykar, now Abikam hight.
Accordingly he entered and prostrated in the King’s presence
and stood up to receive the royal behest, when Pharaoh after a
long delay asked him, “O Abikam, whom do I resemble and what
may these my Lords and Ministers represent?” Hereto the envoy
answered saying, “O my lord, thou favourest Bel the idol<a id="r66"></a><a href="#f66" class="c011"><sup>[66]</sup></a> and thy
chieftains favour the servitors thereof!” Then quoth the King,
“Now do thou depart and I desire thee on the morrow come
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>again.” Accordingly Abikam, which was Haykar, retired as he
was ordered, and on the next day he presented himself before
Pharaoh and after prostrating stood between his hands. The
King was habited in a red coat of various tincts and his mighty
men were garbed in white, and presently he enquired saying, “O
Abikam, whom do I resemble and what may these my Lords and
Ministers represent?” He replied, “O my lord, thou art like
unto the sun and thy nobles are like the rays thereof!” Then
quoth the King, “Do thou retire to thy quarters and to-morrow
come hither again.” So the other fared forth and Pharaoh commanded
and charged his head men to don pure white, himself
doing the same; and, having taken seat upon his throne, he bade
Abikam be brought into the presence and when he appeared asked
him, “Whom do I resemble, and what may these my Grandees
represent?” He replied, “O my lord, thou favourest the moon
and thy servitors and guards favour the stars and planets and constellations.”
Then quoth the King, “Go thou until the morrow
when do thou come hither again;” after which he commanded his
Magnates to don dresses of divers colours and different tincts
whilst he wore a robe of ruddy velvet. Anon he seated him upon
his throne and summoned Abikam, who entered the presence and
prostrated and stood up before him. The King for a fourth time
asked him, “O Abikam, whom do I resemble and what may these
my guards represent?” and he answered, “O my lord, thou art
like the auspicious month Naysán<a id="r67"></a><a href="#f67" class="c011"><sup>[67]</sup></a>, and thy guards and grandees
are like the white chamomile<a id="r68"></a><a href="#f68" class="c011"><sup>[68]</sup></a> and his bloom.” Hearing these
words Pharaoh rejoiced with extreme joy and said, “O Abikam,
thou hast compared me first with Bel the idol, secondly with the
sun and thirdly with the moon and lastly with the auspicious
<span class="pageno" id="Page_28">28</span>month Naysan, and my lords with the chamomile and his flower.
But say me now unto what likenest thou Sankharib thy lord, and
what favour his Grandees?” Haykar made answer, “Heaven forfend
I mention my liege lord the while thou sittest on thy throne;
but rise to thy feet, and I will inform thee what my Master representeth
and what his court most resembleth.” Pharaoh, struck with
astonishment at such heat of tongue and valiancy of speech, arose
from his seat and stood facing Haykar and presently said, “Now
tell me that I may learn what thy lord resembleth and what his
Grandees represent.” The other made reply, “My lord resembleth
the God of Heaven, and his lords represent the Lightning and
Thunder. An it be his will the winds do blow and the rains do
fall; and, when he deign order, the leven playeth and the thunder
roareth and at his behest the sun would refuse light and the moon
and stars stand still in their several courses. But he may also
command the storm-wind to arise and downpours to deluge when
Naysan would be as one who beateth the bough<a id="r69"></a><a href="#f69" class="c011"><sup>[69]</sup></a> and who scattereth
abroad the blooms of the chamomile.” Pharaoh hearing
these words wondered with extreme wonderment, then raging with
excessive rage he cried, “O man, tell me the real truth and let me
know who thou art in very sooth.” “I am Haykar,” quoth the
other, “Chief Secretary and especial to Sankharib the King; also
his Wazir and Councillor of his kingdom and Keeper of his
secret.” “Thou statest fact, O Sage,” quoth Pharaoh, “and
this thy say is veridical: yet have we heard that Haykar is dead
indeed, withal here art thou alive and alert.” The Minister
replied, “Yea, verily that was the case, but Alhamdolillah—Glory
to God, who knoweth all hidden things, my master had in
very deed doomed me die believing the reports of certain traitors,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>but my Lord preserved me and well done to him who relieth
upon the Almighty!” Then quoth Pharaoh, “Go forth and
on the morrow do thou return hither and say me somewhat
no man hath ever heard, nor I nor my Grandees nor any of
the folk in my kingdom and my capital.” Accordingly Haykar
hied him home and penned a paper wherein he said as follows:
“From Sankharib, King of Assyria and Naynawah, to Pharaoh
King of Misraim:—Peace be upon thee, O my brother! As well
thou wottest, brother needeth brother and the Kings require the
aidance of other Kings and my hope from thee is that thou wilt
lend<a id="r70"></a><a href="#f70" class="c011"><sup>[70]</sup></a> me the loan of nine hundred-weight<a id="r71"></a><a href="#f71" class="c011"><sup>[71]</sup></a> of gold which I require
to expend on the pay and allowances due to certain of my soldiery
wherewith to provide for them the necessaries of life.” After this
he folded the writ and despatched it by a messenger on the next
day to Pharaoh, who perused it and was perplext and exclaimed,
“Verily and indeed never till now have I heard a saying like
unto this at all, nor hath anyone ever spoken<a id="r72"></a><a href="#f72" class="c011"><sup>[72]</sup></a> to me after such
fashion!” Haykar replied, “’Tis fact, and ’tis well an thou
own thee debtor of such sum to my lord the King.” Pharaoh
accepted this resolving of his proposition and said, “O Haykar,
’tis the like of thee who suiteth the service of the Kings, and
blessed be Allah who perfected thee in wisdom and adorned thee
with philosophy<a id="r73"></a><a href="#f73" class="c011"><sup>[73]</sup></a> and knowledge. And now remaineth to us only
one need of thee; to wit, that thou build us a bower between
firmament and terra firma.” Haykar replied, “Hearkening and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>obeying! I will edify it for thee e’en as thou wishest and
thou choosest; but do thou get ready for me gypsum lime
and ashlar-stone and brick-clay and handicraftsmen, while I
also bring architects and master masons and they shall erect
for thee whatso thou requirest.” So King Pharaoh gat ready
all this and fared forth with his folk to a spacious plain without
the city whither Haykar and his pages had carried the boys
and the vultures; and with the Sovran went all the great men of
his kingdom and his host in full tale that they might look upon
the wonder which the Envoy of Assyria was about to work. But
when they reached the place appointed, Haykar brought out of
their boxes the vultures and making fast the lads to their backs
bound the cords to the legs of the birds and let them loose,
when they soared firmament-wards till they were poised between
heaven and earth. Hereat the lads fell to crying aloud, “Send up
to us the stones and the mud and the slaked lime that we may
build a bower for King Pharaoh, forasmuch as here we stand the
whole day idle.” At this were agitated all present, and they
marvelled and became perplext; and not less wondered the King
and the Grandees his lieges, while Haykar and his pages fell
to buffeting the handicraftsmen and to shouting at the royal
guards, saying, “Provide the workmen with that they want,
nor hinder them from their work!” Whereupon cried Pharaoh,
“O Haykar, art thou Jinn-mad? Who is ever able to convey
aught of these matters to so far a height?” But he replied to the
King, “O my lord, how shall we build a bower in the lift on other
wise? And were the King my master here he would have edified
two such edifices in a single day.” Hearing this quoth Pharaoh to
him, “Hie thee, O Haykar, to thy quarters, and for the present
take thy rest, seeing that we have been admonished anent the
building of the bower; but come thou to me on the morrow.”
Accordingly, Haykar fared to his lodging, and betimes on the
next day presented himself before Pharaoh, who said to him,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>“O Haykar, what of the stallion of thy lord which, when he
neigheth in Assyria and Nineveh, his voice is heard by our mares
in this place so that they miscarry?<a id="r74"></a><a href="#f74" class="c011"><sup>[74]</sup></a>” Hereat Haykar left the
King and faring to his place took a tabby-cat and tying her up
fell to flogging her with a sore flogging until all the Egyptians
heard her outcries and reported the matter to the Sovran. So
Pharaoh sent to fetch him and asked, “O Haykar, for what
cause didst thou scourge this cat and beat her with such beating,
she being none other but a dumb beast<a id="r75"></a><a href="#f75" class="c011"><sup>[75]</sup></a>?” He replied, “O my
lord the King, she hath done by me a wrongous deed and she
hath amply merited this whipping and these stripes.” The King
asked, “And what may be this deed she did?” whereto Haykar
made answer, “Verily my master Sankharib the King had given
me a beautiful cock who had a mighty fine voice and a strong,
and he knew the hours of darkness and announced them. But
as he was in my mansion this mischief-making tabby fared there
and fell upon him last night and tare off his head; and for this
cause when she returned to me I took to punishing her with
such blows and stripes.” Pharaoh rejoined, “O Haykar, indeed
I see thou art old and doting! Between Misraim and Nineveh
lie eight hundred and sixty parasangs; so how could this cat have
covered them in one night and have torn off thy chanticleer’s
head and have returned by morning to Egypt?” He replied,
“O my lord, seeing that between Egypt and Assyria is such
interval how then can the neighing of my lord the King’s stallion
reach unto Nile-land and be heard by your mares so that here
they miscarry?” When Pharaoh had pondered these words, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>knew that the envoy had returned him a full and sufficient
reply, so quoth he, “O Haykar, ’tis my desire that thou make
for me two ropes of sand;” and quoth the other, “Do thou
prescribe that they bring me a cord from thy stores that I twist
one like it.” So when they had done as he bade, Haykar fared
forth arear of the palace and dug two round borings equal to the
thickness of the cord; then he collected sand from the river-bed
and placed it therein, so that when the sun arose and entered into
the cylinder, the sand appeared in the sunlight like unto ropes.<a id="r76"></a><a href="#f76" class="c011"><sup>[76]</sup></a>
Thereupon quoth he to Pharaoh, “Command thy slaves take up
these ropes and I will twist thee as many of them as thou willest.”
Quoth Pharaoh, “O Haykar, we have before our eyes a millstone
which is broken; and I require of thee that thou sew up the rent.”
Accordingly the Envoy looked about him and, seeing there another
stone, said to Pharaoh, “O my lord, here am I a stranger man nor
have I with me aught of darning-gear; but I would have thee
bid thy confidants amongst the cobblers to provide me out of this
other stone with shoemaker’s awls and needles and scissors
wherewith I may sew up for thee the breach in yon millstone.”
Hereat Pharaoh the King fell a-laughing, he and his Grandees,
and cried, “Blessed be Allah, who hath vouchsafed to thee all
this penetration and knowledge;” then, seeing that the Envoy
had answered all his questions and had resolved his propositions
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>he forthright confessed that he was conquered and he bade them
collect the tax-tribute of three years and present it to him
together with the loan concerning which Haykar had written
and he robed him with robes of honour, him and his guards and
his pages; and supplied him with viaticum, victual and moneys
for the road, and said to him, “Fare thee in safety, O honour of
thy lord and boast of thy liege: who like unto thee shall be
found as a Councillor for the Kings and the Sultans? And do
thou present my salam to thy master Sankharib the Sovran
saying:—Excuse us for that which we forwarded to thee, as the
Kings are satisfied with a scanting of such acknowledgment.”<a id="r77"></a><a href="#f77" class="c011"><sup>[77]</sup></a>
Haykar accepted from him all this; then, kissing ground before
him, said, “I desire of thee, O my lord, an order that not a man
of Assyria and Nineveh remain with thee in the land of Egypt
but fare forth it with me homewards.” Hereupon Pharaoh sent
a herald to make proclamation of all whereof Haykar had spoken
to him, after which the envoy farewelled the King and set out
on his march intending for the realm of Assyria and Nineveh
and bearing with him of treasures and moneys a mighty matter.
When the tidings of his approach came to the ears of Sankharib,
the King rode forth to meet his Minister, rejoicing in him with
joy exceeding and received him lovingly and kissed him, and cried,
“Well come and welcome and fair welcome to my sire and the
glory of my realm and the vaunt of my kingdom: do thou require
of me whatso thou wantest and choosest, even didst thou covet
one-half of my good and of my government.” The Minister
replied, “Live, O King, for ever; and if thou would gift me
bestow thy boons upon Abu Sumayk, the Sworder, whose wise
delay, furthered by the will of Allah Almighty, quickened me
with a second life,” “In thine honour, O my beloved,” quoth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>the King, “I will do him honour;” and presently he fell to
questioning his envoy concerning what had befallen him from
Pharaoh and how the Lord of the Misraim had presented him with
the tax-tribute and moneys and gifts and honourable robes; and
lastly, he asked anent the instances and secrets which ended the
mission. So Haykar related all that had betided, whereat
Sankharib rejoiced with mighty great joy; and, when the converse
was concluded, the King said to him, “O Haykar, take unto thee
everything thou wishest and wantest of all this, for ’tis in the
grasp of thy hand.” Haykar answered, “Live, O King, for ever
and aye; naught do I require save thy safety and the permanency
of thy rule: what shall I do with moneys and such like? But
an thou deign largesse me with aught, make over to me in free
gift Nadan, my sister’s son, that I requite him for that he wrought
with me: and I would that thou grant me his blood and make
it lawfully my very own.” Sankharib replied, “Take him, for
I have given to thee that same.” So Haykar led his nephew
to his home<a id="r78"></a><a href="#f78" class="c011"><sup>[78]</sup></a> and bound his hands in bonds and fettered his
feet with heavy chains; then he beat him with a severe bastinado
and a torturing upon his soles and calves, his back, his belly and
his armpits; after which bashing he cast him into a black hole
adjoining the jakes. He also made Binuhal guardian over him
and bade him be supplied day by day with a scone of bread
and a little water; and whenever the uncle went in to or came
forth from the nephew he would revile Nadan and of his
wisdom would say to him, “O dear my son, I wrought with thee
all manner of good and kindly works and thou didst return me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>therefor evil and treason and death. O dear my son, ’tis said
in saws:—Whoso heareth not through his ears, through the nape
of his neck shall he hear.”<a id="r79"></a><a href="#f79" class="c011"><sup>[79]</sup></a> Hereat quoth Nadan, “O my uncle,
what reason hast thou to be wroth with me?” and quoth Haykar,
“For that I raised thee to worship and honour and made thee
great after rearing thee with the best of rearing and I educated
thee so thou mightest become mine heir in lore and contrivance
and in worldly good. But thou soughtest my ruin and destruction
and thou desiredst for me doom of death; however, the
Lord, knowing me to be a wronged man, delivered me from thy
mischief, for God hearteneth the broken heart and abaseth the
envious and the vain-glorious. O dear my son,<a id="r80"></a><a href="#f80" class="c011"><sup>[80]</sup></a> thou hast been
as the scorpion who when she striketh her sting<a id="r81"></a><a href="#f81" class="c011"><sup>[81]</sup></a> upon brass
would pierce it. O dear my son, thou hast resembled the
Sajálmah-bird<a id="r82"></a><a href="#f82" class="c011"><sup>[82]</sup></a> when netted in net who, when she cannot save
herself alive, she prayeth the partridges to cast themselves into
perdition with her. O dear my son, thou hast been as the cur
who, when suffering cold entereth the potter’s house to warm himself
at the kiln, and when warmed barketh at the folk on such
wise that they must beat him and cast him out, lest after barking
he bite them. O dear my son, thou hast done even as the hog
who entered the Hammam in company with the great; but after
coming out he saw a stinking fosse a-flowing<a id="r83"></a><a href="#f83" class="c011"><sup>[83]</sup></a> and went and
therein wallowed. O dear my son, thou hast become like the
old and rank he-goat who when he goeth in leadeth his friends
and familiars to the slaughter-house and cannot by any means
come off safe or with his own life or with their lives. O dear
my son, a hand which worketh not neither plougheth, and withal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>is greedy and over-nimble shall be cut off from its armpit.
O dear my son, thou hast imitated the tree whom men hew
down, head and branch, when she said:—Had not that in your
hands been of me,<a id="r84"></a><a href="#f84" class="c011"><sup>[84]</sup></a> indeed ye would not have availed to my
felling. O dear my son, thou hast acted as did the she-cat
to whom they said:—Renounce robbing that we make thee
collars of gold and feed thee with sugar and almond cake!
But she replied:—As for me, my craft is that of my father
and my mother, nor can I ever forget it. O dear my son, thou
art as a dragon mounted upon a bramble-bush, and the two
amiddlemost a stream, which when the wolf saw he cried:—A
mischief on a mischief and let one more mischievous counsel
the twain of them. O dear my son, with delicate food I fed thee
and thou didst not fodder me with the driest of bread; and
of sugar and the finest wines I gave thee to drink, while thou
grudgedst to me a sup of cold water. O dear my son, I taught
thee and tendered thee with the tenderest of tending and garred
thee grow like the lofty cedar of Lebanon, but thou didst incriminate
me and confine me in fetters by thine evil courses.<a id="r85"></a><a href="#f85" class="c011"><sup>[85]</sup></a> O dear
my son, I nourished a hope that thou wouldst build me a strong
tower wherein I might find refuge from mine adversary and foil
my foes; but thou hast been to me as a burier, a grave-digger,
who would thrust me into the bowels of the earth: however, my
Lord had mercy upon me. O dear my son, I willed thee well and
thou rewardedst me with ill-will and foul deed; wherefore, ’tis
now my intent to pluck out thine eyes and hack away thy tongue
and strike off thy head with the sword-edge and then make thee
meat for the wolves; and so exact retaliation from thine abominable
actions.” Hereupon Nadan made answer and said to Haykar
his uncle, “Do with me whatso thy goodness would do and then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_37">37</span>condone thou to me all my crimes, for who is there can offend like
me and can condone like thee? And now I pray thee take me
into thy service and suffer me to slave in thy house and groom thy
horses, even to sweeping away their dung, and herd thy hogs; for
verily I am the evil-doer and thou art the beneficent; I am the
sinner and thou art the pardoner.” “O dear my son,” rejoined
Haykar, “Thou favourest the tree which, albe planted by the side
of many waters, was barren of dates and her owner purposed to
hew her down, when she said:—Remove me unto another stead
where if I fruit not then fell me. But he rejoined:—Being upon
the water-edge thou gavest ne’er a date, so how shalt thou bear
fruit being in other site? O dear my son, better the senility of the
eagle than the juvenility of the raven. O dear my son, they said to
the wolf:—Avoid the sheep lest haply the dust they raise in flight
may do thee a damage; but Lupus made answer:—Verily their dust
is a powder good for the eyes. O dear my son, they brought the
wolf to school that he might learn to read; but, when quoth they
to him:—Say A, B, C, D,<a id="r86"></a><a href="#f86" class="c011"><sup>[86]</sup></a> quoth he, Lamb, Sheep, Kid, Goat,<a id="r87"></a><a href="#f87" class="c011"><sup>[87]</sup></a>
even as within my belly. O dear my son, they set the ass’s head
beside a tray of meats, but he slipped down and fell to rolling upon
his back, for his nature (like that of others) may never be changed.
O dear my son, his say is stablished who said:—When thou hast
begotten a child assume him to be thy son, and when thou hast
reared a son assume him to be a slave.<a id="r88"></a><a href="#f88" class="c011"><sup>[88]</sup></a> O dear my son, whoso
doeth good, good shall be his lot; and whoso worketh evil, evil shall
befal him; for that the Lord compensateth mankind according to
conduct. O dear my son, wherewith shall I bespeak thee beyond
this my speech? and verily Allah knoweth concealed things and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_38">38</span>wotteth all secret and hidden works and ways and He shall requite
thee and order and ordain between me and thee and shall
recompense thee with that thou deservest.” Now when Nadan
heard these words from his uncle Haykar, his body began to swell
and become like a blown-up bag and his members waxed puffy,
his legs and calves and his sides were distended, then his belly
split asunder and burst till his bowels gushed forth and his end<a id="t38"></a>
(which was destruction) came upon him; so he perished and fared
to Jahannam-fire and the dwelling-place dire. Even so it is
said in books:—“Whoever diggeth for his brother a pit shall
himself fall into it and whoso setteth up a snare for his
neighbour shall be snared therein.” And this
much know we anent the Say of Haykar
the Sage, and magnification be to
Allah for ever and ever</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE HISTORY OF AL-BUNDUKANI.<br /> <span class="small">OR,</span><br /> THE CALIPH HARUN AL-RASHID AND THE DAUGHTER OF KING KISRA.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span><b>In the name of Allah the Compassionating, the Compassionate,
we here invite, by the aidance of the Almighty and His furtherance, the
History of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and of the Daughter of
Kisra the King.</b><a id="r90"></a><a href="#f90" class="c011"><sup>[90]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c010">It is related (but Allah is all-knowing of His secrets and allkenning
in whatso hath passed and preceded and preterlapsed of
the annals of folk),<a id="r91"></a><a href="#f91" class="c011"><sup>[91]</sup></a> that the Caliph (by whom I mean Harun al-Rashid)
was sitting on the throne of his kingdom one chance day
of the days which happened to be the fête of ’Arafát.<a id="r92"></a><a href="#f92" class="c011"><sup>[92]</sup></a> And as
he chanced to glance at Ja’afar the Barmaki, he said to him, “O
Wazir, I desire to disguise myself and go down from my palace
into the streets and wander about the highways of Baghdad that I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>may give alms to the mesquin and miserable and solace myself
with a sight of the folk: so do thou hie with me nor let any know
of our faring forth.” “With love and good will,” quoth Ja’afar.
So his lord arose and passed from the audience-room into the inner
palace where the two donned disguise and made small their sleeves
and breasts<a id="r93"></a><a href="#f93" class="c011"><sup>[93]</sup></a> and issued forth to circle about the thoroughfares of
Baghdad and her market-streets, distributing charity to the poor
and the paupers, until the last of the day. And whilst so doing,
the Commander of the Faithful chanced to espy a woman seated
at the head of a highway who had extended the hand of beggary,
showing at the same time her wrist and crying, “Give me somewhat
for the sake of Allah Almighty!” Hereat he considered her
nicely and saw that her palm and her wrist were like whitest
crystal and yet more brilliant in brightness. So he wondered
thereat, and presently pulling a dinar from his breast-pocket he
handed it to Ja’afar and said, “Bestow it upon yonder woman.”
The Minister took the ducat and leaving his lord went up to her
and placed it in her palm; and, when she closed her fingers thereupon,
she felt that the coin was bigger than a copper or a silverling,
so she looked thereat and saw that it was of gold. Hereupon she
called after Ja’afar who had passed onwards, saying, “Ho, thou
fair youth!” and when he came back to her she continued, “The
dinar wherewith thou hast gifted me, is it for Allah’s sake or for
other service?” Said he, “’Tis not from me, nay ’twas given by
yonder Youth who sent it through me.” “Ask him,” she rejoined,
“and tell me what may be his purport.” Ja’afar hied him back
to the Caliph and reported her words, whereat his lord commanded
him, “Go back and say thou to her ’tis for Almighty Allah’s sake.”
The Minister did his master’s bidding when she replied, “His
reward be upon the Almighty.” Then the Wazir returned and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>reported the woman’s prayer to the Commander of the Faithful,
who cried, “Hie thee to her and enquire an she be married or
virginal; and, if she be unwedded, do thou ask her an she be
willing to wive with me.”<a id="r94"></a><a href="#f94" class="c011"><sup>[94]</sup></a> So Ja’afar fared to her and questioned
her, whereat she answered, “A spinster.” Quoth he, “The Youth
who sent the dinar to thee desireth to mate with thee;” and quoth
she, “An he can pay me my dower and my money down,<a id="r95"></a><a href="#f95" class="c011"><sup>[95]</sup></a> I will
become his bride.” Hereat Ja’afar said in his thought, “Whence
can the Prince of True Believers find her dower and her money
down? Doubtless we shall have to ask a loan for him;”<a id="r96"></a><a href="#f96" class="c011"><sup>[96]</sup></a> and
presently he enquired of her what might be the amount of both.
Replied she, “As for the pin-money, this shall be the annual
revenue of Ispahán, and the income of Khorásán-city shall form
the settlement.” So Ja’afar wagged his head and going back to
the Commander of the Faithful repeated her terms; wherewith
Harun was satisfied and bespake him, “Hie thee to her and
say:—He hath accepted this and thou hast professed thyself
contented.” Hearing his words she rejoined, “What be his worth,
yonder man, and how may he attain unto such sum?” and he
retorted, “Of a truth he is the Commander of the Faithful, Harun
al-Rashid.” When this reply reached her ears she veiled her hands
and feet crying, “To Allah be laud and gratitude;” adding to Ja’afar,
“An he be the Prince of True Believers, I am satisfied therewith.”
Accordingly the Wazir returned to the Caliph and reported her
consent, whereafter the twain repaired homewards and the Caliph
despatched to her a duenna and a train of handmaidens who went
and bore her to the Hammam within the palace and bathed her.
Then they brought her out and robed her in sumptuous raiment,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>such as becometh the women of the Kings, and ornaments and
jewellery and what not: after which they led her to a fine apartment
which was set apart and private for her wherein also were
meat and drink and furniture, arras<a id="r97"></a><a href="#f97" class="c011"><sup>[97]</sup></a> and curtains and all necessaries
of such sort. In fine they fared to the Caliph and apprized him
of what they had done and he presently gave command to summon
the four Kazis who wrote her marriage-lines. When it was night
he paid her the first visit and taking seat opposite her he asked,
“Daughter of whom mayst thou be amongst the folk that thou
demandedst of me this dower?” “Allah advance in honour the
Commander of the Faithful,” answered she; “verily thy handmaid is
of the seed of Kisrà Anushirwán; but the shifts of time and tide
brought me down and low down.” Replied he, “They relate that
thine ancestor, the Chosroë, wronged his lieges with mighty sore
wronging;”<a id="r98"></a><a href="#f98" class="c011"><sup>[98]</sup></a> and she rejoined, “Wherefor and because of such
tyranny over the folk hath his seed come to beg their bread at the
highway-heads.” Quoth he, “They also make mention of him
that in after-times he did justice to such degree that he decided
causes between birds and beasts;” and quoth she, “Wherefor hath
Allah exalted his posterity from the highway-head and hath made
them Harím to the Prince of True Believers.” Hearing this the
Caliph was wroth with mighty great wrath<a id="r99"></a><a href="#f99" class="c011"><sup>[99]</sup></a> and sware that he
would not go in unto her for a full told year, and arising forthright
went forth from her. But when the twelvemonth had passed and
the fête-day of Arafat came round again, the Commander of the
Faithful donned disguise and taking with him Ja’afar and Masrúr
the Eunuch, strolled out to wander about the streets of Baghdad and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_45">45</span>her highways. And as they walked along, the Caliph looked about
him and beheld a booth wherein a man was turning out Katífah-cakes<a id="r100"></a><a href="#f100" class="c011"><sup>[100]</sup></a>
and he was pleased to admire his dexterity to such degree
that, returning to the Palace, he sent him one of his Eunuchs
with the message, “The Prince of True Believers requireth of thee
an hundred pancakes, and let each one of them, when filled and
folded, fit into the hollow of a man’s hand.” So the Castrato
went and gave the order as we have related and paid the price
and, when the pastrycook had made his requirement, he carried it
away to the presence. Then the Caliph took seat and bade bring
sugar and pistachios and all other such needs wherewith he fell
to stuffing the pancakes with his own hands and placing in each
and every a golden dinar. When this was done he despatched
the same Eunuch to Kisra’s daughter with the message, “This
night the Commander of the Faithful proposeth to visit thee, the
year of his oath having expired, and he sendeth to thee saying:—What
is it thy heart coveteth that he may forward it to thee?” The
Castrato set forth upon this errand and received for all reply, “Say
him my heart desireth naught, for that all I require is with me, nor
is there aught of deficiency.” Accordingly, he returned and repeated
her words to the Caliph who bade him fare forth again to her and
say the same to her a second time, whenas she, “Let him send me
a thousand dinars and a duenna in whom he confideth, so that I
may disguise myself and go down with her and distribute gold to
the mean and the mesquin.” Presently back came the slave bearing
this reply, whereat the Caliph ordered the moneys be sent to
her and the woman required; and the twain, Princess and duenna,
went forth and threaded the lanes of Baghdad and her great
thoroughfares whilst the young lady distributed her charity to the
Fakirs and the paupers. But when all the gold with her had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_46">46</span>been expended and naught of it remained, they turned homewards
making for the Palace; and, the day being sultry, drowthiness
befel the young lady. So she said to her companion, “O mother
mine, I am athirst and want a draught of water to drink;” and
said the other, “We will call aloud to the Water-carrier<a id="r101"></a><a href="#f101" class="c011"><sup>[101]</sup></a> who shall
give thee thy need.” Replied the Princess, “Drinking from the
Waterman’s jar will not be pleasant to my heart; nor will I touch
it, for ’tis like the whore<a id="r102"></a><a href="#f102" class="c011"><sup>[102]</sup></a> whereinto some man goeth every hour:
let the draught of water be from a private house and suffer that it
be given by way of kindness.” Hereupon the old woman looked
in front of her and saw a grand gateway with a door of sandalwood
over which a lamp hung by a silken cord<a id="r103"></a><a href="#f103" class="c011"><sup>[103]</sup></a> and a curtain was
drawn across it and it had two benches of marble, the whole under
the charge of a goodly concierge. Then quoth she, “From this
house I will ask a drink for thee.” So the two women went
forward and stood before the door and the duenna advancing
rapped a light rap with the ring, when behold, the entrance was
opened and came forth a young man in youthful favour fair and
robed in raiments pure and rare and said, “’Tis well!” Hereat the
governante addressed him, “O my son, indeed this my daughter is
athirst and I crave of thy kindness that thou give her a draught of
water, seeing that she will not drink from the Water-carrier.” He
replied, “With love and goodwill;” and going within brought out
what was required and handed the cup to the old woman. She
took it and passed it on to her mistress and the young lady turning
her face to the wall raised her veil and drank her sufficiency without
showing a single feature.<a id="r104"></a><a href="#f104" class="c011"><sup>[104]</sup></a> After this she returned the cup to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_47">47</span>the old woman who took it and handed it back to the young man
saying, “Allah requite thee with all of weal, O my son!” whereto he
replied, “Health to you and healing!”<a id="r105"></a><a href="#f105" class="c011"><sup>[105]</sup></a> And the two went their
way and returned to the Palace and entered therein. On such
wise fared it with these twain; but as regards the Caliph, when he
had finished filling the pancakes, he ranged them in a large charger
of porcelain; then, summoning the Eunuch he said to him, “Take
up this and carry it to the daughter of Kisra and say her:—Here
be the sweetmeats of peace, and let her know that I will night
with her this night.” The Castrato did his lord’s bidding; and
carrying the charger to the Princess’s apartment handed it to the
duenna and delivered the message, whereupon she blessed and
prayed for the Commander of the Faithful and the slave departed.
Now he was angry and disappointed for that he could not eat one
pancake of them all because they had become big by stuffing and
he feared that if he touched any thereof its place would show void.
Presently it so befel that the young lady said to the old woman,
her governante, “Do thou take up this charger and carry it to the
youth who gave us the draught of water with the intent that he
may not claim an obligation or have aught to desire of us.”
Accordingly, the ancient dame took the charger and walked off
with it. But on her way she longed for a Katifah and put forth
her hand to one and took it up when she saw that it left in the line
of pancakes a gap big as a man’s palm. Hereat she feared to
touch it and replaced it saying, “’Twill be known that I carried
off one of them.” Then after returning the pancake to its place,
she passed on with the charger to the door of that young man
whom she suddenly sighted as he sat at the gateway. She saluted
him with the salam which he returned, and then said she, “O my
son, the young lady who drank the water hath sent thee all these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_48">48</span>cates in acknowledgment for the draught thou gavest her to drain.”
Said he, “Set it down on the door-bench;” and, when she did his
bidding, he expressed his thanks to her and she ganged her gait.
Now as the youth still sat there, the Watchman of the Ward
suddenly stood before him blessing him and saying, “O my lord,
this be Arafat-day and to-night will be the Eve of the ’I´d, or
Greater Festival; so I hope from the beneficence of my master the
Chamberlain and Emir Alaeddin (whom Allah Almighty keep and
preserve!) that he will deign order me a largesse befitting the Fête
wherewith I may buy sweetmeats for my wife and children.” The
other replied, “Take this charger and wend thy ways therewith;”
so the Watchman kissed his hand and carrying it off went home
and showed it to his wife. But she cried, “O thou miserable,<a id="r106"></a><a href="#f106" class="c011"><sup>[106]</sup></a>
whence gottest thou this charger: hast thou wilfully stolen it or
suddenly snatched it?”<a id="r107"></a><a href="#f107" class="c011"><sup>[107]</sup></a> Replied her mate, “This be the property
of the Emir Alaeddin, the Chamberlain (whom Allah preserve!),
and he gave it to me as an alms-gift; so come hither all
of you that we eat, for the pancakes look toothsome.” Rejoined
his wife, “Art thou Jinn-mad? Up with thee and sell the charger
and cates, for the worth must be some thirty to forty dirhams which
we will lay out for the benefit of the little ones.” He retorted,
“O woman, suffer us eat of this food wherewith the Almighty would
feed us;” but she fell to wailing and crying out, “We will not
taste thereof while the children lack caps and slippers.”<a id="r108"></a><a href="#f108" class="c011"><sup>[108]</sup></a> And
she prevailed over him with her opinion, for indeed women are
<span class="pageno" id="Page_49">49</span>mostly the prevailers. So taking up the charger he fared with it
to the market-place and gave it for sale to a broker, and the man
began crying, “Who will buy this charger with whatso is thereon?”
Hereat up came the Shaykh of the Bazar who bid forty dirhams
therefor, and a second merchant raised its price to eighty, when a
third hent it in hand and turning it about espied graven upon the
edge, “Made by commandment of Harun al-Rashid, Commander
of the Faithful.” Hereat the trader’s wits fled him and he cried
to the broker, “Hast thou a will to work for my hanging in this
matter of the charger?” Quoth the other, “What may be the
meaning of these words?” and quoth the merchant, “This charger
is the property of the Prince of True Believers.” The broker,
dying of dread, took the charger and repaired therewith to the
Palace of the Caliphate where he craved leave to enter; and, when
this was accorded, he went in and kissed ground before the presence
and blessed the Commander of the Faithful and lastly
showed to him the charger. But when the Caliph looked at it and
considered it carefully, he recognized it with its contents, and he
waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said in himself, “When I
make aught for the eating of my household, shall it be sent out
and hawked about for sale?” adding to the broker, “Who gave
thee this charger?” “O my lord, ’twas the Watchman of one of
the wards,” replied he; and Harun rejoined, “Bring him to me
hither.” So they fared forth and fetched him bound in cords and
saying in his mind, “The whore would not suffer us eat of that was
in the charger and enjoy its sweetness, so this happened which
hath happened to us; we have eaten naught and have fallen into
misfortune.” But when they set him between the hands of the
Caliph the latter asked him, “Where haddest thou yon charger?
say me sooth or I will smite thy neck!” The Watchman
answered, “Allah prolong the life of our liege lord! verily as
regards this charger it was given to me by the Lord Alaeddin,
the junior Chamberlain.” Hereat the Prince of True Believers
<span class="pageno" id="Page_50">50</span>redoubled in rage and cried, “Bring me that Emir with his
turband in tatters, and drag him along on his face and plunder
his home.” Accordingly the magnates fared forth with their
pages; and, reaching the house, knocked at the door, when the
owner came out and, seeing the officials, asked, “What is to do?”
“’Tis against thee,” replied some of the Grandees, whereto the
Chamberlain rejoined, “Hearkening and obeying Allah and
then the Commander of the Faithful!” After this they bore
him to the Palace of the Caliphate and an Emir of them put
forth his hand to the Chamberlain’s coat and tare it and rent his
turband adown his neck saying, “O Alaeddin,<a id="r109"></a><a href="#f109" class="c011"><sup>[109]</sup></a> this is the behest
of the Prince of True Believers who hath enjoined that we do
with thee on such wise and we despoil thy house: yet there is
bread and salt between us albe we must do as we are bidden, for
obedience to royal behest is of the ways of good breeding.”
Then they carried him into the presence of the Caliph and he,
after he was made to stand between the Sovran’s hands, kissed
ground and blessed Harun and said, “Allah give aidance to our
liege lord and have him in His holy keeping: what may be the
offence of thine humble slave that he hath merited such treatment
as this?” Harun raised his head and asked, “Say me,
knowest thou yon fellow?” and the other looked and seeing the
guardian of the gates corded and pinioned made answer, “Yes
indeed, I know him and he is the Watchman of our ward.” The
Caliph resumed, “Whence came to thee this charger?” and the
Chamberlain replied, “Let the Commander of the Faithful (to
whom Almighty Allah vouchsafe furtherance!) learn that I was
sitting at home when there rapped a rap at the door; and I, going
<span class="pageno" id="Page_51">51</span>forth to open, beheld an ancient dame who said to me:—O my
son, this my daughter is athirst and I beg thee of thy bounty to
give her a draught of water for she will not take drink from the
public Sakká. So I brought them out their requirement and they
satisfied themselves and went their ways. After an hour or so I
came forth and took seat by my house-door when behold, up came
the old woman bearing in hand yon charger and said:—O my
son, the person to whom thou suppliedest drink hath sent this to
thee in requital for that thou gavest her of water inasmuch as
she is unwilling to be under an obligation. Quoth I:—Set it
down; when she placed it upon the edge of the Mastabah-bench
and left me. Thereupon suddenly came up this Watchman and
craved from me the Sweetmeat of the Festival, whereto I
answered:—Do thou take this charger and its contents (whereof
by the bye I had not tasted aught); and he did so and departed.
This is all I know and—The Peace.” Now when the Commander
of the Faithful heard this from the Chamberlain, his heart was
gladdened and he enquired, “O Alaeddin, what time the young
lady drank the draught of water didst thou see her face or not?”
and the Chamberlain replied in haste, “O Prince of True Believers,
indeed I did see it.” Hereat Harun was wroth with exceeding
wrath and bade summon the daughter of Kisra and when she
came bade the twain be beheaded saying, “Thou farest forth
to do alms-deeds, and thou durst display thy features to this
fellow when thou drankest water at his hand!” Hereat she
turned her towards Alaeddin and replied, “Thou see my face!
Nay, this is but a lie that may work my death.” He rejoined,
“The Reed-pen wrote what ’twas bidden write!<a id="r110"></a><a href="#f110" class="c011"><sup>[110]</sup></a> I designed to
say:—Verily I beheld naught of her and my tongue ran as it
did the sooner to end our appointed life-term.” Then having set
the twain upon the rug of blood the Sworder bound their hands
<span class="pageno" id="Page_52">52</span>and tearing off a strip from their skirts bandaged their eyes,
whereafter he walked around them and said, “By leave of the
Commander of the Faithful;” and Harun cried, “Smite!” Then
the Headsman paced around them a second time saying, “By
leave of the Commander of the Faithful,” and Harun again cried,
“Smite!” But when the executioner did in like manner for the
third and last time<a id="r111"></a><a href="#f111" class="c011"><sup>[111]</sup></a> quoth he to Alaeddin, “Hast thou haply in
heart aught of regret or requirement that I may fulfil it to thee?
Ask of me anything save release, ere the Commander of the
Faithful say the word and forthright thy head fall before thy
feet?” “I desire,” quoth the Chamberlain, “that thou unbind
this bandage from mine eyes so may I look one latest look at the
world and at my friends, after which do thou work thy will.”
The Sworder granted this and Alaeddin glanced first to the right
where he saw none to aidance dight, and then to the left where
he found all favour reft; and the spectators each and every hung
their heads groundwards for awe of the Caliph, nor did any take
upon himself to utter a kindly word. Whereupon the Chamberlain
cried out his loudest saying, “A counsel, O Commander of the
Faithful!” and Harun regarding him asked, “What is it thou
counsellest?” “A respite of three days’ space,” rejoined the
condemned, “when thou shalt see a marvel, indeed a miracle of
miracles;” and the Caliph retorted, “After the third day, an I see
not as thou sayest I will assuredly smite thy neck;” and bade
them bear him back to gaol. But when the appointed term
ended, the Caliph sprang up and in his impatience to see what
would befal him donned a dress distinctive of his new calling,<a id="r112"></a><a href="#f112" class="c011"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
and thrusting his feet into coarse shoon and high of heel<a id="r113"></a><a href="#f113" class="c011"><sup>[113]</sup></a> and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_53">53</span>binding about his brows a honey-coloured turband<a id="r114"></a><a href="#f114" class="c011"><sup>[114]</sup></a> he hent in
hand a pellet-bow<a id="r115"></a><a href="#f115" class="c011"><sup>[115]</sup></a> and slung its case over his shoulders: he also
took gold in pouch and thus equipped he left the palace. Then,
as he roamed about the lanes of Baghdad and her highways,
giving alms and saying in his mind, “Haply may I sight the
wonder which the Chamberlain Alaeddin announced to me,” it
befel about mid-forenoon (and he still walking) that behold, a man
came forth from the Kaysaríyah<a id="r116"></a><a href="#f116" class="c011"><sup>[116]</sup></a> or chief mart of the merchants
crying aloud, “This be a marvel, nay a miracle of miracles.” So
the Caliph questioned him saying, “What be this wonder thou
hast seen?” and he answered, “Within yon Kaysariyah is a
woman who reciteth the Koran even as it was brought down,<a id="r117"></a><a href="#f117" class="c011"><sup>[117]</sup></a>
and albeit she have not ceased declaiming from the hour of the
dawn-prayer until this time, yet hath none given her a single
dirham: no, nor even one mite;<a id="r118"></a><a href="#f118" class="c011"><sup>[118]</sup></a> and what strangeness can be
stranger than this I tell thee?” The Caliph, hearing his words
<span class="pageno" id="Page_54">54</span>entered the mart wherein he descried an ancient dame sitting and
reciting the Koran and she had well nigh reached the end thereof.
He was charmed with the beauty of her lecture and stood there
until she had finished it and had blessed the by-standers, but when
he glanced round he saw nobody give her aught. So he thrust
his hand into his pouch saying in his mind, “Whatso<a id="r119"></a><a href="#f119" class="c011"><sup>[119]</sup></a> of coin
remaineth in purse shall go to this woman.” And he designed to
gift her with the gold when suddenly the old dame sprang from
her seat and going to a merchant’s shop took seat beside the man
and said to him, “O my son, dost thou accept of a fair young
lady?” Said he, “Yea, verily,” and she continued, “Up with
thee and come that I show thee a thing whose like thou hast
never seen.” Now when the Caliph heard her words he said to
himself, “Look at yon foul old crone who playeth bawd when I
held her to be a devotee, a holy woman. Indeed I will not give
her aught until I see what work is wrought by these twain.” The
trader then followed the old woman to her home wherein both,
youth and crone, entered and the Caliph who pursued them also
went in privily and took his station at a stead whence he could
see without being seen.<a id="r120"></a><a href="#f120" class="c011"><sup>[120]</sup></a> Then lo and behold! the old trot called
to her daughter who came forth from the bower wherein she was,
and the Caliph looking at this young lady owned that he had
never sighted amongst his women aught fairer than this, a model
of beauty and loveliness and brilliancy and perfect face and
stature of symmetric grace. Her eyes were black and their
sleepy lids and lashes were kohl’d with Babylonian witchery, and
her eyebrows were as bows ready to shoot the shafts of her killing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_55">55</span>glances, and her nose was like unto the scymitar’s edge, and her
mouth for magical might resembled the signet-ring of Sulayman
(upon whom be The Peace!), and her lips were carnelians twain,
and her teeth union pearls and her mouth-dews sweeter than
honey and more cooling than the limpid fount; with breasts
strutting from her bosom in pomegranate-like rondure and waist
delicate and hips of heavy weight, and stomach soft to the touch
as sendal with plait upon plait, and she was one that excited the
sprite and exalted man’s sight even as said a certain poet in song
of her like:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Breeze-wavèd branch, full moon o’ murk or sun of undurn sheeny bright, ✿ Which is she hight who all the three hath might to place in pauper plight, ah!</div>
      <div class="line">Where on the bending branch alight with grace of stature like to hers ✿ Tho’ be the branch by Zephyr deckt and in its ornaments bedight, ah!</div>
      <div class="line">And how can fellowèd be her brow with fullest moon that lights the darks ✿ When sun must borrow morning light from that fair forehead dazzling bright, ah!</div>
      <div class="line">Were set in scales the fairest fair and balanced with a long compare ✿ Their boasts, thou haddest over-weight for beauty and their charms were light, ah!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c013">Now when he considered her straitly, she captured the whole of
his heart. But the young lady had not upon her clothes enough
for concealment, and here and there her body showed bare; so
when she came forth and espied the young man standing by the
old woman she withdrew into her bower and said to her mother,
“Allah requite<a id="r121"></a><a href="#f121" class="c011"><sup>[121]</sup></a> thee for that thou hast done. How can it be
allowed thee by the Almighty to set me in this state before a
stranger?” “Hold thy peace,” said her parent; “man is allowed
to look, and if he have any art or part in the object looked at ’tis
well; but thereafter if he look without its being his lot, then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_56">56</span>twere unlawful. This youth hath gazed upon thee, and if he
prove to have a portion in thee let him take it, otherwise he may
wend his ways, nor is there a flaw in aught of legal observance.”
Hereat the Caliph’s heart was cheered, for he knew that the ancient
dame meant to marry the maid. Anon quoth the old mother to
the merchant, “Hast thou seen her?” and quoth he, “Yes.”
“Did she please thee?” asked the crone, and he answered “Yea
verily,” adding, “How much may be her actual marriage-settlement
and her contingent dower?” She replied, “The first shall
consist of four thousand dinars and the second shall be the same.”
“This be overmuch,” rejoined the youth, “and more than all my
good; to wit, four thousand gold pieces, the gift of which will
send me forth to beg; but do thou take of me a thousand dinars,
and upon me be the arraying of the house and the maiden’s
raiment for another thousand; so will I do business and trade
with the remainder.” But the crone sware to him by Allah the
Almighty,<a id="r122"></a><a href="#f122" class="c011"><sup>[122]</sup></a> that an the four thousand failed of a single gold piece
he should never see of the damsel a single hair. He replied, “I
have no power thereto and—good day to both of you;” and he
made for the door, but the Caliph forewent him to the street and
standing in a corner suffered him to pass and gang his gait. After
this Harun went back to the old woman, and entering salam’d to
her and she, returning his salutation, asked him, “What dost thou
want and what may be thy wish?” He answered, “The young
trader who went forth hence sent me to say that he hath no intent
to wed,” and she rejoined, “On this mind the man hied away from
us.” Then quoth the Caliph, “I will marry the maid, and by me
is all thou canst desire of gold and what not.” She retorted, “O
Robber,<a id="r123"></a><a href="#f123" class="c011"><sup>[123]</sup></a> all I see upon thee is not worth two hundred dirhams:
whence then canst thou procure four thousand dinars?” Quoth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>he, “Hast thou grapes to sell, or wishest thou only to breed a
quarrel between me and the vineyard-keeper?”<a id="r124"></a><a href="#f124" class="c011"><sup>[124]</sup></a> and quoth she,
“Doubtless I have and hold the grapes.” “Then, I possess all
thou canst desire,” said he, and said she, “Then, we will wed thee
when thou shalt have weighed out the gold.” The Caliph cried,
“I accept;” and anon entering the lodging he took seat at the
head of the chamber and in its place of honour, and said to the
house-mistress, “Go thou to Kází Such-an-one and tell him that
Al-Bundukáni requireth him.” “O Robber,” said she, “will the
Kazi be content to come at thy bidding?” The Commander of
the Faithful laughed at these words and said, “Do thou go without
danger and bid him bring his ink-case and pens and paper.” So
she went off saying to herself, “Verily, an the Judge accompany
me, this my son-in-law must be a Captain of Robbers.”<a id="r125"></a><a href="#f125" class="c011"><sup>[125]</sup></a> But when
at last she arrived at the Kazi’s mansion she saw him sitting in
the middle of the room and surrounded by doctors of divinity and
a host of learned wights: so she feared to enter, and fell to looking
in through the doorway and she dreaded to fare farther and stepped
backwards; withal she kept saying, “How shall I go home without
speaking a word to the Kazi?” and the thought would hearten
her heart, so she would return to the entrance and thrust in her
head and then withdraw it. On such wise she had done many a
time when the Kazi, catching sight of her, bade one of his
messengers bring her within; so the man went to her and said,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>“Bespeak the Kazi!” So she went in full of affright and salam’d
to the Judge who, returning her salutation, asked her, “What is
thy want, O woman?” She answered, “There is a young man
in my house who desireth that thou come to him;” whereat he
rejoined, “And who may be this youth that I in person should
hie to him; and what may be his name?” She replied, “He
pretendeth to the name of Al-Bundukani—the Arbalestrier” (which
was a by-name of the Caliph kept concealed from the folk but
well known to all officials). Hereat the Kazi sprang to his feet
without stay or delay and said to her, “O my lady, do thou forego
me,” whilst all present asked him, “O our lord, whither away?” and
he, answering them “A need hath suddenly occurred,” went forth.
Then quoth the crone in her mind, “Hapless the Kazi who is a
pleasant person, haply this son-in-law of mine hath given him to
drink of clotted gore<a id="r126"></a><a href="#f126" class="c011"><sup>[126]</sup></a> by night in some place or other and the
poor man hath yet a fear of him; otherwise what is the worth of
this Robber that the Judge should hie to his house?” When they
reached the door, the Kazi bade the ancient dame precede him;<a id="r127"></a><a href="#f127" class="c011"><sup>[127]</sup></a>
so she went in and called to him and he on entering saw the Caliph
seated at the head of the chamber. He would have kissed ground
but Harun signed to him silence with a wink; so he made his
salam and sat him down saying, “’Tis well,<a id="r128"></a><a href="#f128" class="c011"><sup>[128]</sup></a> O my lord, what may
be thy want?” The Prince of True Believers replied, “I desire
thou marry me to the daughter of this ancient dame, so do thou
write out the writ.” Hereupon the Judge asked the assent of the
old woman and of her daughter; and, when they both granted it,
he enquired, “What may be the amount of the dower?” The
mother replied, “Four thousand dinars of gold and the like sum
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>in ready coin.” “Dost thou accept?” quoth the Kazi to the
Caliph, and quoth he, “Yes.” Accordingly, the Judge wrote out
the writ upon the skirt of his Farajiyah-robe for in his agitation
he had forgotten to bring paper, and he set down the name of the
Sovran and his father and his grandfather without question for
that he knew them well; after which he enquired of the old
woman her daughter’s name<a id="r129"></a><a href="#f129" class="c011"><sup>[129]</sup></a> and that of her sire and grandsire.
She wailed and cried, “Why and wherefore?<a id="r130"></a><a href="#f130" class="c011"><sup>[130]</sup></a> Oh miserable that
we are! Had her father been living how would this Robber have
availed to stand at our door, much less to marry here? but ’twas
Death that did with us this deed.” “Allah bless the wronged,”<a id="r131"></a><a href="#f131" class="c011"><sup>[131]</sup></a>
quoth the Kazi and busied himself with writing out the writ; but
whatever question he put to the crone, she wailed in reply and
buffeted her cheeks, whilst the Judge wagged his head and his
heart was like to burst and the Caliph laughed long and loud.
And when the writ was written and finished, the writer cut off from
the skirt of his gown according to the measure of the writing and
gave it to Harun; then he rose up to fare forth but he was ashamed
to wear a robe in rags, so he stripped it off and said to the old
woman, “O my mother, present this to anyone deserving it.”
And so saying he left the house. Hereupon quoth the old woman
to the Caliph, “Dost thou not pay unto the Kazi his fee for
coming to thee in person and writing the writ upon his robe which
he was obliged to throw away?” “Let him go,” said the Caliph,
“I will not give him aught.” Cried she, “And why? Oh, how
greedy are these robbers! the man came to us in hopes of gain
and we have stripped him instead of robing him.” Harun laughed
again, then he arose and said to her, “I now hie me home to fetch
<span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>thee the gold and the stuffs wherewith to clothe my bride,” and
the crone cried out, “O Robber, whence shalt thou find cloth and
coin? unhappy some one whom thou designest to seize and deprive
of his daily bread and reduce to poverty and penury!” The
Commander of the Faithful held his peace and went forth intending
for his Palace, where he donned the royal robes and taking seat
upon his throne bade summon marble-cutters and carpenters and
plasterers and house-painters. Then, as they came to the presence
and kissed ground and blessed him and prayed for the permanence
of his empire, he had them thrown and bade administer to them a
bastinado of two hundred sticks a head.<a id="r132"></a><a href="#f132" class="c011"><sup>[132]</sup></a> And when they prayed
for mercy and said to him, “O our lord, the Commander of the
Faithful, what be our crime?” he said to the artizans, “The
hall such-and-such in the Darb-al-Záji,<a id="r133"></a><a href="#f133" class="c011"><sup>[133]</sup></a> do ye wot it well?” They
replied, “Yes,” and he resumed, “I desire that ye fare thither
forthright and ye repair the walls with marble-slabs and should
mid-afternoon come on and ye leave unfinished a place as big as a
man’s palm, I will hack off your hands and place them in lieu
thereof.” “O Prince of True Believers,” asked they, “how shall we
do seeing that we have no marble?”<a id="r134"></a><a href="#f134" class="c011"><sup>[134]</sup></a> He answered, “Take it from
the government stores<a id="r135"></a><a href="#f135" class="c011"><sup>[135]</sup></a> and collect each and every stone-cutter in
Baghdad. But do you all bear in mind that, if the household enquire
who sent you, ye must reply, Thy son-in-law; and should they
demand, What is his craft, say, We ken not; and when they require
<span class="pageno" id="Page_61">61</span>to know his name declare it to be Al-Bundukani. And whoso of you
shall speak aught beyond this him will I crucify.” So the master-mason
went forth and gathered together the stone-cutters and
took marble and ashlar from the stores and set the material on
the backs of beasts with all other needs and he repaired to the
hall,<a id="r136"></a><a href="#f136" class="c011"><sup>[136]</sup></a> and entered with his company. Hereat the old woman asked
“What is’t ye want?” “We would slab the floors and walls of
this dwelling with marble!” “And who was it sent you?”
“Thy son-in-law!” “And what may be his business?” “We
know not.” “Then what is his name?” “Al-Bundukani,” they
replied. So she said to herself, “He is naught but a Robber and
Captain of thieves.” Then the masons divided and marked out
the ground, and each found that each and every had to pave and
slab a surface of a cubit or less. Such was their case; but as
concerneth the Caliph, he turned him to the chief Carpenter, and
looking at him keenly said, “Go thou likewise and assemble all
thy fellows in the capital: then do thou repair to the dwelling
of Such-an-one and make the doors and so forth, in fact everything
needed of carpentry and joinery, taking thee all the requisites
from the public warehouses; nor let the afternoon come on
ere thou shalt have finished, and if all be not done I will strike
thy neck.” He also charged them even as he had charged the
marble-cutters never to divulge his dignity or even his name
other than Al-Bundukani. So the chief Carpenter went and,
gathering his craftsmen, took planks and nails and all his needs,
after which they repaired to the lodging and entered, and setting
up their scaffoldings<a id="r137"></a><a href="#f137" class="c011"><sup>[137]</sup></a> fell to work while the head man marked off
a task for each hand. But the crone was consterned and cried to
the men, “And why? Who hath sent you?” “Thy son-in-law!”
“And what may be his trade?” “We know not.” “Then what
<span class="pageno" id="Page_62">62</span>may be his name?” “Al-Bundukani.” So they pushed on their
work, each urging his fellow, whilst the old woman well-nigh waxed
Jinn-mad,<a id="r138"></a><a href="#f138" class="c011"><sup>[138]</sup></a> and said to herself, “This my son-in-law, the Robber,
is naught save a viceroy of the Jánn; and all this is of their fear,
so that none dareth or deemeth it safe to disclose the craft or
even the name of him, so much do they hold him in awe.” Lastly,
the Caliph bade the plasterers and house-painters call a meeting
of their brother-craftsmen and go to the government stores and
thence take all their requirements of quicklime and hemp<a id="r139"></a><a href="#f139" class="c011"><sup>[139]</sup></a> and so
forth; and lastly, charging them as he had charged the others
who forewent them, he said, “As soon as the Izán of mid-afternoon
prayer shall be cried, if any one of you shall have left in
the lodging work unwrought, be it only the size of a man’s palm,
I will hack off his hand and set it upon the unfinished stead.”
Accordingly, they kissed ground and fared forth carrying with
them all their requirements; and, repairing to the tenement,
entered therein and slaked their lime and set up their ladders,
and four or five artificers fell to working at every wall whilst the
house-painters followed them. But when the ancient dame beheld
this, her wits were wildered and she was utterly bedazed: so said
she to her daughter, “This son-in-law of mine is none save one
whose word is heard, and folk abide in awe of him; otherwise who
could work all this work in a single day whenas none other than
himself could have wrought the same within a twelvemonth?
But pity ’tis he be a Robber.” Anon she went to the plasterers
and said, “Who was it sent you?” “Thy son-in-law!” “And
what may be his trade?” “We know not.” “Then what is his
name?” “Al-Bundukani.” After this she passed on to the
house-painters and asked the same question and receiving the same
<span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>reply, quoth she to one of them, “I demand of thee, by God the
Great, O my son, why thou wilt not disclose to me concerning my
son-in-law his name and his craft?” Thereupon quoth the wight
addressed, “No man hath power to speak out, otherwise his life is
lost;” and she repeated to herself, “Indeed he is none but a
mighty Robber, for that the Moslems one and all dread him and
his mischief.”<a id="r140"></a><a href="#f140" class="c011"><sup>[140]</sup></a> Now when mid-afternoon came, the artizans
had done the whole of their work; so they donned their outer
dresses and went forth intending for the Commander of the Faithful,
Harun the Orthodox. And when they entered all kissed
ground and said, “Under the good auspices of our lord the Prince
of True Believers we have wroughten the work of the house.” So
he bestowed robes of honour upon them and gave them gifts that
contented them, after which they fared forth about their business.
Then the Caliph summoned Hammáls or porters and set in their
crates articles of furniture such as carpets and counterpanes and
sofa-cushions and hangings of arras and prayer-rugs, besides gear
of brass and all such necessaries for the household; and to this he
added two baskets containing body-raiment and kimcob or gold
cloth and stuffs inworked and studded with gems; also jewellery
and precious stones, pearls and what not: nor did he forget a
coffer containing the eight thousand pieces of gold.<a id="r141"></a><a href="#f141" class="c011"><sup>[141]</sup></a> Then he
sent them upon their errand, saying, “Take up all this and bear
it to such a house in the Darb al-Zaji and make it over to the
ancient dame who owneth the hall; and when she asketh, Who
was it sent you? do ye answer, Thy son-in-law; and should she
enquire, What is his craft? respond, We know it not; and should
she demand the name, declare Al-Bundukani.” Accordingly the
porters fared forth, and reaching the tenement rapped at the door,
when the old woman came out and cried, “Who knocketh here?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>and they replied, “Open and take what we have brought of cloth
and clothes and so forth.” But when she looked upon the loads
she wailed and cried, “Indeed ye have wandered from the way:
whence could all this prosperity have befallen us? return with it
to the owner thereof.” They asked her, “Is not this hall that
which was builded this day?” And when she answered, “Yes,”
quoth they, “Then ’twas hither thy son-in-law sent us.” With
these words they went in and set down whatso was with them,
but the old woman wailed and cried aloud, “’Tis not for us: ye
have wandered from your way.” “It is for you, indeed,” they
rejoined, “and thy son-in-law saith:—Adorn your dwelling
and don the stuffs and dress therewith whomso you choose:
as for him, he hath much business yet will he come to you
what time the folk sleep.” “Yes, indeed,” quoth she to herself,
“Robbers never do come save by night.” And when the Hammals
went their ways the old woman fared forth to her neighbours and
summoned them to assist her in ranging the furniture and <em>vaiselle</em>;<a id="r142"></a><a href="#f142" class="c011"><sup>[142]</sup></a>
so they gathered together and entered; and, when they beheld
what had befallen, their eyes were dazed and dazzled by seeing
the restoration of the hall and by the stuffs and vases therein. So
they asked her, “Whence camest thou by all this, and who set for
thee this dwelling in such condition and at what time? Yesterday
’twas a ruin and showed neither marble nor whitewash nor
stencilling. Can it not be that we are sleeping and haply that
we see a dream-house?” She replied, “No vision is this, but
evidence of eye-sight: and what work ye behold was wrought by
my son-in-law during this one day and to-day also he sent me
these stuffs and other matters whereon ye look.” “And who may
be thy son-in-law?” asked they, “and when didst thou wed thy
daughter while we wotted naught thereof?” Answered she, “To-day
all this happened;” and they rejoined, “And what may be
<span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>the bridegroom’s calling? haply he is a mighty merchant or an
Emir.” “Nor merchant nor Emir,” quoth she, “but a Robber and
the Head and Captain of Bandits!” Hereat the women were
startled and cried, “Allah upon thee, do thou charge him anent us
that he plunder not aught from our houses, seeing that we have
a claim of neighbourhood and gossipry upon you.” “Never fear,”
she replied, “he is not wont to take aught of neighbours albeit
he be a Viceregent of the Jann.” So their hearts were heartened,
and they fell to ordering the furniture and decorations; and,
when they had ended the ordinance of the house, they applied
themselves to dressing the bride; and they brought her a
tirewoman and robed her in the finest robes and raiment and
prepared her and adorned her with the choicest ornaments.
And while they did thus behold, up came other porters carrying
crates of meat, such as pigeon-poults and poultry, Katás,<a id="r143"></a><a href="#f143" class="c011"><sup>[143]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>and quails,<a id="r144"></a><a href="#f144" class="c011"><sup>[144]</sup></a> lambs and butcher’s meat, clarified butter and
other cooking material, with all manner of edibles and delicacies
such as sugar and Halwá-confections and the like
thereof. The Hammals then said to the household, “Take ye
this which your son-in-law hath sent to you saying:—Do
ye eat and feed your neighbours and whomso ye please.”
Quoth the old woman, “I ask you, for Allah’s sake, to let me
know what may be my son-in-law’s craft and his name;” and
quoth they, “His name is Al-Bundukani, but what his business
may be we know not;” and so saying they went their ways.
Hereupon exclaimed certain of the women who were present,
“By the Apostle, he is naught but a robber;” while others who
had claims upon the old house-mistress cried, “Be whatever may
be, before the man who can do after this fashion all the folk in
Baghdad are helpless.” Presently they served the provision and
all ate their sufficiency; then they removed the trays and set
on others loaded with the confections which they also enjoyed;
and at last after dividing the orts amongst the neighbours they
reserved some of the best of meats and sweetmeats for the bridegroom’s
supper. In due time a report was bruited about the
quarter that the old woman had wedded her daughter with a
robber who had enriched them with what booty he had brought
them. And these tidings spread from folk to folk till they
reached the young merchant of whom mention hath been made,
the same who had sought the maiden to wife and who had not
wedded her because refused by her mother. Also he was told that
the damsel had been married to a robber who had rebuilt the hall
with marble, and the plasterers and painters and carpenters and
joiners had wrought therein works which astounded the beholders;
moreover that the bridegroom had sent them of stuffs and jewellery
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>a matter beyond count or compute. Hearing this report he found
the matter grievous on him and the fire of envy flamed in his heart
and he said to himself, “Naught remaineth to me except that I
wend me to the Wálí<a id="r145"></a><a href="#f145" class="c011"><sup>[145]</sup></a> and tempt him with promises and thereby
work the ruin of this robber and take the damsel to myself.” With
these words he rose up sans stay or delay and, going to the Chief
of Police related to him all that occurred and promised him a
muchel of money saying, “Whatso thou wantest can be gotten
from this robber inasmuch as he owneth good galore.” The Wali
rejoiced and replied, “Be patient until after supper-tide when the
thief shall have returned home and we will go and catch him and
thou shalt carry away the young lady.” So the trader blessed him
and took himself off and waited at home until it was supper-time
and the streets were void of folk. Presently Názúk<a id="r146"></a><a href="#f146" class="c011"><sup>[146]</sup></a> the Wali
mounted horse with four hundred headsmen and smiters of the
sword, link-boys and low fellows,<a id="r147"></a><a href="#f147" class="c011"><sup>[147]</sup></a> bearing cressets and paper-lanthorns
under four head constables and rode to the house of the
old woman. Now all the gossips had departed to their abodes and
were dispersed, nor did one of them remain behind; but the household
had lighted wax candles and was expecting the bridegroom
with bolted doors when behold, the Chief of Police came up and
finding all shut bade his men knock with an easy rap. This was
heard by those within the hall and the ancient dame sprang up and
went to the entrance, whence she espied gleams of light athwart
the door-chinks and when she looked out of the window she saw
the Wali and his merry men crowding the street till the way was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>cut. Now the Chief had a lieutenant Shamámah<a id="r148"></a><a href="#f148" class="c011"><sup>[148]</sup></a> hight, which
was a meeting-place of ill manners and morals; for naught was
dearer to him save the straitening of a Moslem, nor was there
upon his body a single hair which affected or aided the veiling of
Allah.<a id="r149"></a><a href="#f149" class="c011"><sup>[149]</sup></a> Brief he was, even as the poet said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Whoreson and child of thousand pagans twain; ✿ Son of the Road to lasting sin and bane;</div>
      <div class="line">The Lord of Ruth ne’er grew him e’en a hair ✿ Was not with this or that of contact fain!<a id="r150"></a><a href="#f150" class="c011"><sup>[150]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now this man, who was standing beside the Chief of Police, seized
the opportunity of saying, “O Emir, what booteth our standing
idle in this stead? Better ’twere that we break down the door and
rush in upon them and snatch what we want and loot all the stuffs
in the house.” Hereat came forward another lieutenant who was
called Hasan<a id="r151"></a><a href="#f151" class="c011"><sup>[151]</sup></a>—the Handsome—for that his face was fair and his
works were fairer and he was a meeting-place of fairest deeds;
and the same was wont to stand at the Wali’s door as a symbol of
ruth to mankind. So he came forward and said, “O Emir, this
were not the rede which is right and yonder man’s words lack
good counsel, seeing that none hath complained against this folk
and we know not an the accused be a thief or not: furthermore
we fear consequences for that haply this merchant speaketh with
an object, they having forbidden his marrying the girl: do not
therefore cast thyself into that shall harm thee, but rather let us
enquire anent the matter openly and publicly; and should it prove
to be as reported, then the Emir’s opinion shall prevail.” All this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>took place while the old woman heard from behind the door whatso
they said. Hereat she dried up with dread and affright and going
within acquainted her daughter with what had occurred and
ended with, “The Wali still is standing at the door.” The young
lady was sore terrified and said to her mother, “Do thou bar<a id="r152"></a><a href="#f152" class="c011"><sup>[152]</sup></a> the
entrance till Allah haply deign bring us comfort.” So the old
woman fared forth and bolted and barred it yet more straitly; and
when they knocked a second time she acknowledged the rap by
“Who is at the door?” and the lieutenant Shamamah replied to
her and said, “O ill-omened old woman, O accomplice of robbers,
knowest thou not that he who rappeth is the Master of Police and
his young men? So open to us forthright.” Quoth she, “We be
Haríms and ne’er a man with us, therefore we will not open to
any;” and quoth he, “Open, or we will break it down.” The old
woman made no reply but returning to her daughter within said
to her, “Now look at this Robber and how from the first of this
night we have been humbled for his sake: yet had he fallen into
this trap his life had been taken, and would Heaven he may not
come now and be made prisoner by them. Ah me! Were thy
father on life the Wali never had availed to take station at our
house-door or the door of any other.” “Such be our lot,” replied
the girl, and she went to the casement that she might espy what
was doing. This is how it fared with them; but as concerneth the
Caliph, when the folk had finished crowding the streets he disguised
himself and hending in hand his pellet-bow and slinging his sword
over his shoulder he went forth intending for his bride. But when
reaching the head of the street he saw lanthorns and stir of crowd<a id="r153"></a><a href="#f153" class="c011"><sup>[153]</sup></a>:
so he approached to look and he espied the Wali and his men with
the merchant standing by the Chief’s side together with the
lieutenants, all save one shouting, “Break down the door and rush
in and seize the old woman: then let us question her with torture
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>until she confess where be her Robber of a son-in-law.” But
Hasan the fourth officer dissuaded them saying, “O good folk, do
ye fear Almighty Allah and be not over hasty, saving that hurry
is of old Harry. These be all women without a man in the house;
so startle them not; and peradventure the son-in-law ye seek
may be no thief and so we fall into an affair wherefrom we may
not escape without trouble the most troublous.” Thereupon
Shamamah came up and cried out, “O Hasan, it ill becometh
thee to stand at the Wali’s door: better ’twere for thee to sit on
the witness-bench; for none should be gate-keepers to a head
policeman save they who have abandoned good deeds and who
devour ordure<a id="r154"></a><a href="#f154" class="c011"><sup>[154]</sup></a> and who ape the evil practices of the populace.”
All this and the Caliph overheard the fellow’s words and said to
himself, “’Tis well! I will indeed gladden thee, O Accurst.”
Then he turned and espied a street which was no thoroughfare,
and one of its houses at the upper end adjoined the tenement
wherein was his bride; so he went up to it and behold, its gateway
showed a curtain drawn across and a lamp hung up and an Eunuch
sitting upon the door-bench. Now this was the mansion of a
certain noble who was lord over a thousand of his peers and his
name was the Emir Yúnas<a id="r155"></a><a href="#f155" class="c011"><sup>[155]</sup></a>: he was an angry man and a violent;
and on the day when he had not bastinado’d some wight he would
not break his fast and loathed his meat for the stress of his ill-stomach.
But when the Eunuch saw the Caliph he cried out at
him and sprang up to strike him exclaiming, “Woe to thee! art
thou Jinn-mad? Whither going?” But the Commander of the
Faithful shouted at him saying, “Ho! thou ill-omened slave!”
and the chattel in his awe of the Caliphate fancied that the roar
was of a lion about to rend him and he ran off and entered the
presence of his owner quivering with terror. “Woe to thee!” said
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>his master; “what hath befallen thee?” and he, “O my lord, the
while I was sitting at the gate suddenly a man passed up the street
and entered the house-door; and, when I would have beaten him,
he cried at me with a terrible voice saying:—Ho, thou ill-omened
slave! So I fled from him in affright and came hither to thee.”
Now when the Emir Yunas heard his words, he raged with such
excessive rage that his soul was like to leave his body and he cried
out saying, “Since the man addressed thee as ‘ill-omened slave,’
and thou art my chattel, I therefore am servile and of evil-omen.
But indeed I will show him his solace!” He then sprang to his
feet and hent in hand a file-wrought mace<a id="r156"></a><a href="#f156" class="c011"><sup>[156]</sup></a> studded with fourteen
spikes, wherewith had he smitten a hill he had shivered it; and
then he went forth into the street muttering, “I ill-omened!”<a id="r157"></a><a href="#f157" class="c011"><sup>[157]</sup></a>
But the Caliph seeing him recognised him straitway and cried,
“Yunas!” whereat the Emir knew him by his voice, and casting
the mace from his hand kissed ground and said “’Tis well, O
Commander of the Faithful!” Harun replied, “Woe to thee,
dog! whilst thou art the Chief of the Emirs shall this Wali, of
men the meanest, come upon thy neighbours and oppress them
and terrify them (these being women and without a man in the
house), and yet thou holdest thy peace and sittest in ease at home
nor goest out to him and ejectest him by the foulest of ejections?”
Presently the other replied, “O Prince of True Believers, but for
the dread of thee lest thou say:—This be the warder of the
watch, why hast thou exceeded with him?, I would have made
for him a night of the fulsomest, for him and for those with him.
But an the Caliph command I will forthright break them all to bits
nor leave amongst them a sound man; for what’s the worth of this
Wali and all his varlets?” “First admit us to thy mansion,”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_72">72</span>quoth the Commander of the Faithful; so they passed in and the
housemaster would have seated his visitor for the guest-rite but he
refused all offers and only said, “Come up with us to the terrace-roof.”
Accordingly they ascended and found that between it and
the dwelling of the bride was but a narrow lane; whereupon quoth
the Caliph, “O Yunas, I would find a place whence I can look
down upon these women.” “There is no other way,” quoth the
other, “save herefrom; and, if thou desire, I will fetch thee a
ladder<a id="r158"></a><a href="#f158" class="c011"><sup>[158]</sup></a> and plant it in such wise that thou canst pass across.”
“Do so,” rejoined the other, and the Emir bringing a ladder
disposed it after bridge fashion that the Caliph crossed over the
lane to the house on the other side. Then quoth he, “Go sit thee
in thy stead, and when I want thee I will call.” Yunas did as he
was bidden and remained on the watch for his lord’s summons.
But the Prince of True Believers walked over the terrace-roof with
the lightest tread and not audible, lest his footsteps frighten the
inmates, till he came to the parapet<a id="r159"></a><a href="#f159" class="c011"><sup>[159]</sup></a> and looking adown therefrom
upon the hall he saw a site like the Garden of Paradise which had
been newly pranked and painted, whilst the lighted wax-candles
and candelabra showed the young lady, the bride, sitting upon her
bedstead adorned with gems and jewellery. She was like a Sun
shedding sheen in sky serene, or a full moon at the fullest seen,
with brow flower-bright and eyes black and white and beauty-spots
fresh as greenth to the sight; brief she was as one of whom the
poet saith:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Caliph was astonishment-struck at what he sighted of her
beauty and loveliness whilst her mother stood before her saying,
“O my child, how shall be our case with these tyrants,<a id="r161"></a><a href="#f161" class="c011"><sup>[161]</sup></a> especially
we being women and sans other recourse save Allah Almighty?
Would Heaven I wot whence came to us this Robber who, had
thy sire been on life, would have been far from able to stand at the
door. But this is the doom of Destiny upon us by God’s will.”
Replied the young lady, “O mother mine, and how long wilt thou
put me to shame for this young man and call him ‘Robber,’ this
whom the Almighty hath made my portion; and haply had he
been a good man and no thief he had been given to some other?<a id="r162"></a><a href="#f162" class="c011"><sup>[162]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>However he is my lot, and lauds to the Lord and gratitude for
that He hath bestowed and made my portion.” When the ancient
dame heard these words she pursued, “I hope to Heaven, O my
daughter, that thy portion may not come hither this night, otherwise
sore I fear they will seize him and do him a harm and well-away
for his lost youthtide!” All this took place between mother
and daughter whilst the Caliph stood upon the terrace-roof
listening to their say and presently he picked up a pebble the size
of a vetchling<a id="r163"></a><a href="#f163" class="c011"><sup>[163]</sup></a> and, setting it between his thumb and forefinger,
jerked it at the wax candle which burned before the young lady
and extinguished the light. “Who put out yon taper?” cried the
old woman, “and left the others afire?” and so saying she
rose and lighted it again. But Harun took aim at that same and
jerking another pebble once more extinguished it and made her
exclaim, “Ah me! what can have put out this also?” and when
the quenching and quickening were repeated for the third time she
cried with a loud voice saying, “Assuredly the air must have
waxed very draughty and gusty; so whenever I light a candle the
breeze bloweth it out.” Hereat laughed the young lady and
putting forth her hand to the taper would have lit it a third time
<span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>when behold, her finger was struck by a pebble and her wits fled
her head. But as the mother turned towards the terrace-wall the
first glance showed to her sight her son-in-law there sitting, so she
cried to her daughter, “O my child, behold thy bridegroom whence
he cometh unto thee, but robbers arrive not save by the roof, and
had he not been a housebreaker he would have entered by the
door. However Alhamdolillah that he hath chosen the way of
our terrace, otherwise they had captured him;” presently adding
“Woe to thee, O miserable, fly hence or the watch at the door
shall seize thee and we women shall not avail to release thee after
thou fallest into their hands; nor will any have ruth upon thee;
nay, they will cut off at least one of thine extremities. So save
thyself and vanish so as not to lapse into the grip of the patrol.”
But hearing these her words he laughed and said to her, “Do thou
open to me the terrace-wicket that I come down to you and see
how to act with these dogs and dog-sons.” She replied, “Woe to
thee, O miserable, deemest thou these be like unto that poor Kazi
who snipped his gown in fear of thee: he who now standeth at
the door is Nazuk Wali and hast thou authority over him also?”
He repeated, “Open to me that I may come down, otherwise I
will break in the door;” so she unbolted the terrace-wicket and
he descended the stairs and entered the hall where he took seat
beside his bride and said, “I am an-hungered: what have ye by
way of food?” The ancient dame cried, “And what food shall go
down grateful to thy stomach and pleasant when the police are at
the door?” and he replied, “Bring me what ye have and fear not.”
So she arose and served up to him whatso remained of meat and
sweetmeat and he fell to morselling<a id="r164"></a><a href="#f164" class="c011"><sup>[164]</sup></a> them with mouthfuls and
soothing them with soft words till they had their sufficiency of
victual, after which she, the mother-in-law, removed the tray.
Meanwhile the Chief of Police and his varlets stood shouting at
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>the door and saying, “Open to us otherwise we will break in.”
Presently quoth the Caliph to the old trot, “Take this seal-ring and
go thou forth to them and place it in the Wali’s hands. An he
ask thee, Who is the owner of this signet? answer thou, Here is
he with me; and if he enquire of thee, What doth he wish and
what may he want? do thou reply, He requireth a ladder of four
rungs and its gear, not forgetting a bundle of rods;<a id="r165"></a><a href="#f165" class="c011"><sup>[165]</sup></a> also do thou,
O man, enter with four of thy lieutenants and see what else he
demandeth.” When the ancient dame heard this from him she
exclaimed, “And doth the Wali also dread thee or fear this seal-ring?
My only fear is that they may now seize me and throw me
and beat me with a bastinado so painful that it will be the death
of me, and they hearken not to a word of mine, nor suffer thee to
avail me aught.” Rejoined the Caliph, “Be not alarmed, he shall
not be able to gainsay my word;” and she, “An the Wali fear thee
and give ear to thee, then will I gird my loins and suffer thee to
teach me something of thy craft even were it that of robbing
slaves’ shoon.” “Go forth without affright,” said he laughing at
her words, whereupon she took the seal-ring and went as far as
behind the door and no farther, muttering to herself, “I will not
open it wholly but only a little so as to give them the signet; then
if they hearken to what saith this Robber ’tis well, otherwise I will
keep the bolt fastened as it was.” Presently she went forward and
addressed the watch saying, “What is it ye want?” and Shamamah
cried in reply, “O ill-omened old baggage, O rider of the jar,<a id="r166"></a><a href="#f166" class="c011"><sup>[166]</sup></a> O
consorter of thieves, we want the robber who is in thy house that
we may take him and strike off his hand and his foot; and thou
shalt see what we will do with thee after that.” She shrank from
his words, but presently she heartened her heart and said to him,
“Amongst you is there any who can read a whit?” “Yes,” said
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>the Wali, and she rejoined, “Take thou this seal-ring and see what
be graven thereupon and what may be its owner’s name.”
“Almighty Allah curse him,” cried the lieutenant Shamamah,
presently adding to the Wali, “O Emir, as soon as the old crone
shall come forth I will throw her and flog her with a sore flogging;
then let us enter the door and slay her and harry the house and
seize the robber; after which I will inspect the signet and find out
its owner and who sendeth it; then, if this be one of whom we
stand in shame we will say, Indeed we read not its graving before
the command was somewhat rashly carried out. On this wise
none may avail to molest us or thee.” Hereupon he drew near the
door and cried to her, “Show me that thou hast, and perhaps the
sending it may save thee.” So she opened one leaf of the door
sufficient to thrust out her hand and gave him the ring which he
took and passed to the Chief of Police. But when the Wali had
considered and read the name engraved (which was that of the
Commander of the Faithful Harun the Orthodox), his colour waxed
wan and his limbs quaked with fear. “What is to do with thee?”
asked Shamamah, and the other answered, “Take and look!”
The man hent the ring in hand and coming forward to the light
read what was on it and understood that it was the signet of the
Vicar of Allah. So a colick<a id="r167"></a><a href="#f167" class="c011"><sup>[167]</sup></a> attacked his entrails and he would
have spoken but he could stammer only “Bí, Bí, Bí”<a id="r168"></a><a href="#f168" class="c011"><sup>[168]</sup></a> whereupon
quoth the Master of Police, “The rods of Allah are descending
upon us, O accurst, O son of a sire accurst: all this is of thy dirty
dealing and thy greed of gain: but do thou address thy creditor<a id="r169"></a><a href="#f169" class="c011"><sup>[169]</sup></a>
and save thyself alive.” Hereat quoth Shamamah, “O my lady,
what dost thou require?” and quoth she to herself, “Indeed I am
<span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>rejoiced for that they dread my son-in-law;” and presently she
spoke aloud to him and said, “The lord of the seal-ring demandeth
of thee a ladder of four rungs, a bundle of rods and cords and a
bag containing the required gear,<a id="r170"></a><a href="#f170" class="c011"><sup>[170]</sup></a> also that the Wali and his four
lieutenants go within to him.” He replied, “O my lady chief of
this household, and where is he the owner of the signet?” “Here
is he seated in the hall,” she replied and the Wali rejoined, “What
was it he said to thee?” She then repeated the command about
the Wali and the men and the bag, whereat he asked again concerning
the whereabouts of the signet-owner and declared the gear
to be ready, while all of them bepiddled their bag-trousers with
fear.<a id="r171"></a><a href="#f171" class="c011"><sup>[171]</sup></a> Then the Wali and his four lieutenants, amongst whom was
Shamamah the Accurst, entered the house, and the Caliph commanded
lieutenant Hasan (knowing him for a kindly man of
goodly ways and loath to injure his neighbour as proved by his
opposing the harshness of Shamamah), saying, “Hie thee, O
Hasan, and summon forthright Yunas the Emir of a thousand!”
So this lord came in all haste<a id="r172"></a><a href="#f172" class="c011"><sup>[172]</sup></a> and was bidden to bastinado the
Wali and Shamamah which he did with such good will that
the nails fell from their toes; after which they were carried off
and thrown into gaol. Then the Caliph largessed lieutenant
Hasan; and, appointing him on the spot Chief of Police, dismissed
the watch to their barracks. And when the street was cleared
the old woman returning to the Harem said to her son-in-law,
laughing the while, “There be none in this world to fellow thee as
the Prince of Robbers! The Wali dreadeth thee and the Kazi
dreadeth thee and all dread thee, whilst I gird my loins in thy
service and become a she-robber amongst the women even as thou
art a Robber amongst men, and indeed so saith the old saw:—The
<span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>slave is fashioned of his lord’s clay and the son after the features
of his sire. Had this Wali, at his first coming, let break down
the door and had his men rushed in upon us and thou not present,
what would have been our case with them? But now to Allah be
laud and gratitude!” The Caliph hearing these words laughed,
and taking seat beside his bride, who rejoiced in him, asked his
mother-in-law, “Say me, didst ever see a Robber who bore him
on this wise with the Wali and his men?” and answered she,
“Never, by the life of thee, but may Allah Almighty reprehend
the Caliph for that he did by us and punish him for wronging
us, otherwise who was it forwarded thee to us, O Robber?”
Quoth the Commander of the Faithful in his mind, “How have
I wronged this ill-omened old woman that she curseth me?” and
presently he asked her, “And wherein hath the Caliph done
thee an injury?” She replied, “And what hath the Caliph
left us of livelihood and so forth when he marauded our mansion
and seized all our seisins? Even this hall was part
of the plunder and they laid it waste after taking from it all
they could of marble and joinery and what-not; and they left
us paupers, as thou sawest, without aught wherewith to veil us
and naught to eat. So had it not been that Almighty Allah
favoured us with thyself, O Robber, we had been of the destroyed
by famine and so forth.” “And wherefore did the Caliph plunder
you?” asked he, “And what was the cause of his so doing?”
She answered,<a id="r173"></a><a href="#f173" class="c011"><sup>[173]</sup></a> “My son was a Chamberlain of the Commander of
the Faithful, and one day as he was sitting in this our home
two women asked him for a draught of water which he gave to
them. Presently the elder brought him a porcelain charger full of
pancakes with the tidings that it had been sent as a return gift
from the young lady her companion who had drunk from his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>hand; and he replied, Set it down and wend thy ways, which
she did. Presently as my son sat outside his door, the Watchman
came up to offer blessings on the occasion of the Greater Festival
and he gave him the charger and the man fared forth; but ere an
hour had sped, folk came who marauded our mansion, and seizing
my son, carried him before the Caliph, who demanded of him how
the charger had come to his hands. He told him what I have told
thee, and the Commander of the Faithful asked him:—Say me
sawest thou aught of the charms of the young lady? Now my son
had on his lips to say No, but his tongue foreran him and he
stammered out, Yes, I espied her face, without really having
seen her at all, for that when drinking she had turned to the wall.
The Caliph hearing this hapless reply summoned the lady and
bade smite both their necks, but in honour of the Festival-eve he
had them carried off to prison. Such be then the reason of the
wrong by the Caliph wrought, and except for this injustice
and his seizure of my son, O Robber, it had been long ere thou
hadst wedded my daughter.” When the Prince of True Believers
heard the words of her, he said in his mind, “Verily I have
oppressed these unhappies!” and he presently asked her, “What
wilt thou say if I cause the Caliph to free thy son from gaol and
robe him and return his fiefs to him and promote him in the
Chamberlain’s office and return him to thee this very night?”
Hereat the old woman laughed and made answer, “Hold thy
peace! This one is no Chief of Police that he fear thee and thou
work on him whatso thou willest: this one is the Prince of True
Believers Harun al-Rashid, whose behest is heard both in Orient
and in Occident, the lord of hosts and armies, one at whose gate the
lowest menial is higher in degree than the Wali. Be not therefore
beguiled by whatso thou hast done, nor count the Caliph as one of
these lest thou cast thyself into doom of destruction, and there be
an end of thy affair, while we unfortunates abide without a man in
the house, and my son fail of being righted by him who wronged
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>him.” But when the Commander of the Faithful heard these
words, his eyes brimmed with tears for ruth of her; then, rising
without stay or delay, he would have fared forth when the old
woman and the young lady hung about his neck crying, “We
adjure thee, by Almighty Allah, that thou draw back from this
business, for that we fear greatly on thy account.” But he replied,
“There is no help therefor,” and he made oath that perforce he
must go. Then he fared for the Palace of his kingship, and seating
himself upon the throne bade summon the Emirs and Wazirs and
Chamberlains, who flocked into the presence and kissed ground
and prayed for him saying, “’Tis well, Inshallah! and what may
be the reason for calling us together at this time o’ night?” Said
he, “I have been pondering the affair of Alaeddin the Emir, the
Chamberlain, how I seized him wrongfully and jailed him, yet
amongst you all was not a single one to intercede for him or to
cheer him with your companionship.” They bussed ground and
replied, “Verily we were awe-struck by the majesty of the Prince
of True Believers; but now at this hour we implore of the Commander
of the Faithful his mercy upon his slave and chattel;” and
so saying, they bared their heads and kissing the floor did humble
obeisance. He replied, “I have accepted<a id="r174"></a><a href="#f174" class="c011"><sup>[174]</sup></a> your intercession on
his account, and I have vouchsafed to him pardon; so hie ye to
him and robe him with a sumptuous robe and bring him to me.”
They did the bidding of their lord and led the youth to the presence
where he kissed ground and prayed for the permanence of the
Caliph’s rule; and the Sovran accepting this clothed him in a coat
whereon plates of gold were hammered<a id="r175"></a><a href="#f175" class="c011"><sup>[175]</sup></a> and binding round his
head a turband of fine gauze with richly embroidered ends made
him Chief Lord of the Right<a id="r176"></a><a href="#f176" class="c011"><sup>[176]</sup></a> and said to him, “Hie thee now to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>thy home!” Accordingly he blessed the Prince and went forth
accompanied by all the Emirs who rode their blood-steeds, and
the Knights fared with him and escorted him in procession, with
kettledrums and clarions, till they reached his mansion. Here his
mother and his sister heard the hubbub of the multitude and the
crash of the kettledrums and were asking, “What is to do?”
when the bearers of glad tidings forewent the folk and knocked at
the door saying, “We require of you the sweetmeats of good news,
for the Caliph hath shown grace to Alaeddin the Chamberlain and
hath increased his fiefs besides making him Chief Lord of the
Right.” Hearing this they rejoiced with joy exceeding and gave
to the messengers what satisfied them, and while they were thus,
behold, Alaeddin the son of the house arrived and entered therein.
His mother and sister sprang up and saluted him throwing their
arms round his neck and weeping for stress of gladness. Presently
he sat down and fell to recounting to them what had befallen
him; but chancing to look around he saw that the house had
changed condition and had been renovated; so he said, “O my
mother, the time of my absence hath been short and when was
this lodging made new?” She replied, “O my son, what day thou
wast seized, they plundered our abode even to tearing up the slabs
and the doors, nor did they leave us aught worth a single dirham:
indeed we passed three days without breaking our fast upon aught
of victual.” Hearing this from her quoth he, “But whence cometh
all this to you, these stuffs and vessels and who was it rebuilded
this house in a space so short? Or haply is all this I see in the
lands of dreams?” But quoth she, “Nay, ’tis no vision but an
absolute reality and ’twas all done by my son-in-law in a single
day.” “And who may be my new brother-in-law?” he enquired,
“and when didst thou give away my sister, and who married her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>without my leave?”<a id="r177"></a><a href="#f177" class="c011"><sup>[177]</sup></a> “Hold thy peace, O my son,” rejoined she,
“but for him we had died of want and hunger!” “And what
may be his calling?” the Emir asked, and she answered, “A
Robber!” But when her son heard this he was like to choke with
anger and he cried, “What degree hath this robber that he become
my brother-in-law? Now by the tomb of my forbears I will
assuredly smite his neck.” “Cast away from thee such wild talk,”
cried she, “for the mischief of another is greater than thy mischief,
withal naught thereof availed him<a id="r178"></a><a href="#f178" class="c011"><sup>[178]</sup></a> with a man who wrought all
thou seest in half a day.” Then she related to her son what had
befallen the Kazi and the Wali from the man and how he had
bastinado’d the police, showing him as she spoke the blood
which had poured from their bodies upon the floor for excess of
flogging; and she continued, “Presently I complained to him
of my case, how the Commander of the Faithful had seized thee
and imprisoned thee when he said to me:—At this very moment
I fare to the Caliph and cause him to free thy son and suffer him
to return home; also to robe him and to increase his fiefs; whereupon
he went from us and after an hour, lo and behold! thou
appearedst; so but for him we had never seen thee any more.”
When her son heard these words, his wits were bewildered and he
was confounded at his case, so he asked her, “What may this man
be styled and what may be his name?” She answered, “We are
ignorant an he have any name or not, for however much we
enquired of the marble-cutters and master artificers and handicraftsmen,
they told us only that his bye-name<a id="r179"></a><a href="#f179" class="c011"><sup>[179]</sup></a> is Al-Bundukani
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>without letting us know any other. Moreover on like wise when
he sent me to fetch the Kazi he bade me tell him that Al-Bundukani
had summoned him.” Now when the Emir Alaeddin
heard her name Al-Bundukani he knew that it was the Commander
of the Faithful, nor could he prevent himself springing
to his feet and kissing ground seven times; but as his mother
beheld this she laughed and cried, “O thou brawler,<a id="r180"></a><a href="#f180" class="c011"><sup>[180]</sup></a> ’tis as if he
had met thee in the street and had given thee to drink a draught
of clotted blood, one beyond the common!<a id="r181"></a><a href="#f181" class="c011"><sup>[181]</sup></a> What of thy brave
words when anon thou saidst:—I will smite his neck?” “And
dost thou know,” quoth he, “who may be the person thou so
callest?” and quoth she, “Who may he be?” “The Commander
of the Faithful, the Caliph Harun al-Rashid in person,” cried her
son, “and what other could have done with the Kazi and the Wali
and the rest what he did?” When she heard these words, she
dried up with dread and cried, “O my son, set me in a place of
safety,<a id="r182"></a><a href="#f182" class="c011"><sup>[182]</sup></a> for he will suffer me no longer to cumber the face of earth
by reason of my often speaking at him; nor did I ever cease to
address him as ‘Robber.’” Now whilst they were speaking behold,
came up the Commander of the Faithful, whereat Alaeddin arose
and kissed ground and blessed him, but the ancient dame took to
flight and hid her in a closet. The Caliph seated himself, then he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>looked around and, not seeing his mother-in-law, said to the
Chamberlain, “And where may be thy parent?” “She dreadeth,”
replied Alaeddin, “and standeth in awe of the Caliph’s majesty;”
but Harun rejoined, “There is no harm for her.” Then he bade
her be summoned whereat she appeared and kissed ground and
prayed for the permanency of his kingship, and he said to her,
“Erewhiles thou girdest thy waist to aid me in stealing slaves’ shoon
and now thou fliest from thy teacher?” She blushed for shame and
exclaimed, “Pardon, O Commander of the Faithful,” and Harun
al-Rashid<a id="r183"></a><a href="#f183" class="c011"><sup>[183]</sup></a> replied, “May Allah pardon the Past.” Presently he
sent for the Princess, the daughter of the Chosroe and, summoning
the Kazi, forthright divorced her and gave her in marriage to
Alaeddin, his Chamberlain. Hereupon were spread bride-feasts
which gathered together all the Lords of the Empire and the
Grandees of Baghdad, and tables and trays of food were laid out
during three successive days for the mesquin and the miserable.
The visit of entrance was paid by the two bridegrooms on a single
night when both went in unto their wives and took their joy of
them, and made perfect their lives with the liveliest enjoyment.
And ever after they passed the fairest of days till such time as
came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies
and all passed away and died. So praise be to the Ever-Living
who dieth not!</p>

<p class="c010">It is related (but Allah is All-knowing anent what passed and
preceded us of the histories belonging to bygone peoples) that there
reigned in a city of Roum<a id="r187"></a><a href="#f187" class="c011"><sup>[187]</sup></a> a King of high degree and exalted dignity,
a lord of power and puissance. But this Sovran was issue-less, so he
ceased not to implore Allah Almighty that boon of babe might be
vouchsafed to him and presently the Lord had pity upon him and
deigned grant him a man-child. He bade tend the young Prince
with tenderest tending, and caused him to be taught every branch
of knowledge, and the divine precepts of wisdom and morals and
manners; nor did there remain aught of profitable learning wherein
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>the Youth was not instructed; and upon this education the King
expended a mint of money. Now after the Youth grew up Time
rounded upon the Sovran his sire and his case was laid bare and
he was perplext as to himself and he wotted not whatso he should
ever do. Presently his son took heart to direct him aright, and
asked, “O my father, say me, wilt thou give ear to that wherewith
I would bespeak thee?” “Speak out,” quoth the King, “that is
with thee of fair rede;” and quoth the youth, “Rise, O my sire,
that we depart this city ere any be ware of our wending: so shall
we find rest and issue from the straits of indigence now closing
around us. In this place there is no return of livelihood to us and
poverty hath emaciated us and we are set in the sorriest of conditions
than which naught can be sorrier.” “O my child,” quoth
his sire in reply, “admirable is this advice wherewith thou hast
advised us, O my son, pious and dutiful; and be the affair now
upon Allah and upon thee.” Hereupon the Youth gat all ready
and arising one night took his father and mother without any
being cognisant; and the three, entrusting themselves to the care
of Allah Almighty, wandered forth from home. And they ceased
not wandering over the wilds and the wolds till at last they saw
upon their way a large city and a mighty fine; so they entered it
and made for a place whereat they alighted. Presently the young
Prince arose and went forth to stroll about the streets and take
his solace; and whilst he walked about he asked concerning the
city and who was its Sovran. They gave him tidings thereof
saying, “This be the capital of a Sultan, equitable and high in
honour amongst the Kings.” Hereupon returning to his father
and mother, quoth he to them, “I desire to sell you as slaves to
this Sultan,<a id="r188"></a><a href="#f188" class="c011"><sup>[188]</sup></a> and what say ye?” Quoth they, “We have committed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>our case to Almighty Allah and then to thee, O our
son; so do whatso thou wishest and judgest good.” Hereat the
Prince, repairing to the Palace, craved leave to enter to the King
and, having obtained such permission, made his obeisance in the
presence. Now when the Sultan looked upon him he saw that his
visitor was of the sons of the great, so he asked him, “What be
thy need, Ho thou the Youth?” and the other made answer,
“O my lord, thy slave is a merchant man and with me is a male
captive, handy of handicraft, God-fearing and pious and a pattern
of honesty and honour in perfect degree: I have also a bondswoman
goodly in graciousness and of civility complete in all thou
canst command of bondswomen; these I desire to vend, O my lord,
to thy Highness, and if thou wouldst buy them of thy servant they
are between thy hands and at thy disposal, and we all three are
thy chattels.” When the King heard these pleasant words spoken
by the Youth, he said to him, “And where are they? Bring them
hither that I behold them; and, if they be such as thou informest
me, I will bid them be bought of thee!” Hereupon the Prince
fared forth and informed his parents of this offer and said to them,
“Rise up with me that I vend you and take from this Sultan your
price wherewith I will pass into foreign parts and win me wealth
enough to redeem and free you on my return hither. And the
rest we will expend upon our case.” “O our son,” said they, “do
with us whatso thou wishest.” Anon,<a id="r189"></a><a href="#f189" class="c011"><sup>[189]</sup></a> the parents arose and
prepared to accompany him and the Youth took them and led
them into the presence of that Sultan where they made their
obeisance, and the King at first sight of them marvelled with
extreme marvel and said to them, “Are ye twain slaves to this
young man?” Said they, “Yes, O our lord;” whereupon he
turned to the Youth and asked him, “What be the price thou
requirest for these two?” “O my lord,” replied he, “give me to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>the price of this man slave, a mare saddled and bridled and perfect
in weapons and furniture;<a id="r190"></a><a href="#f190" class="c011"><sup>[190]</sup></a> and, as for this bondswoman, I desire
thou make over to me as her value, a suit of clothes, the choicest
and completest.” Accordingly the Sultan bade pay him all his
requirement, over and above which he largessed him with an
hundred dinars; and the Youth, after obtaining his demand and
receiving such tokens of the royal liberality, kissed the King’s
hands and farewelled his father and mother. Then he applied
himself to travel, seeking prosperity from Allah and all unknowing
whither he should wend. And whilst he was faring upon his
wayfare he was met by a horseman of the horsemen,<a id="r191"></a><a href="#f191" class="c011"><sup>[191]</sup></a> and they
both exchanged salutations and welcomings, when the stranger
was highly pleased at the politeness of the King’s son and the
elegance of his expressions. Presently, pulling from his pocket a
sealed letter wrapt in a kerchief he passed it over to the Youth,
saying, “In very sooth, O my brother, affection for thee hath
befallen my heart by reason of the goodliness of thy manners and
elegance of thine address and the sweetness of thy language; and
now I desire to work thy weal by means of this missive.” “And
what of welfare may that be?” asked the Prince, whereto the
horseman answered, “Take with thee this letter and forthwith upon
arriving at the Court of the King whither thou art wending, hand
to him this same; so shalt thou obtain from him gain abundant
and mighty great good and thou shalt abide with him in degree of
highmost honour. This paper (gifted to me by my teacher) hath
already brought me ample livelihood and prodigious profit, and
I have bestowed it upon thee by reason of thine elegance and good
breeding and thy courteousness in showing me respect.” Hereat
the Youth, the son of the King, answered him, “Allah requite
thee with weal and grant thou gain thy wish;” and so saying
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>accepted the letter of that horseman with honest heart and
honourable intent, meditating in his mind, “Inshallah ta’álà—an
it be the will of God the Greatest I shall have good fortune to my
lot by the blessing of this epistle; then will I fare and set free my
father and my mother.” So the Prince resumed his route and he
exulted in himself especially at having secured the writ, by means
whereof he was promised abundant weal. Presently, it chanced
that he became drowthy with excessive drowth that waxed right
sore upon him and he saw upon his path no water to drink; and
by the tortures of thirst he was like to lose his life. So he turned
round and looked at the mare he bestrode and found her covered
with a foam of sweat wholly unlike her wonted way. Hereat
dismounting he brought out the wrapper wherein the letter was
enrolled and loosing it he mopped up therewith his animal’s
sweat and squeezing it into a cup he had by him drank it off
and found to his joy that he was somewhat comforted. Then,
of his extreme satisfaction with the letter, he said to himself,
“Would Heaven I knew that which is within, and how the profit
which the horseman promised should accrue to me therefrom.
So let me open it and see its contents that my heart may be
satisfied and my soul be joyed.” Then he did as he devised
and perused its purport and he mastered its meaning and the
secret committed to it, which he found as follows:—“O my
lord, do thou straightway on the arrival of him who beareth
these presents slay him, nor leave him one moment on life;
because this Youth came to me and I entreated him with
honour the highmost that could be of all honouring, as a return
for which this traitor of the salt, this reprobate betrayed me in a
daughter that was by me. I feared to do him dead lest I
come to shame amongst the folk and endure disgrace, I and my
tribe, wherefore I have forwarded him to thy Highness that thou
mayest torture him with torments of varied art and end his affair
and slaughter him, thus saving us from the shame which befel us
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>at the hands of this reprobate traitor.”<a id="r192"></a><a href="#f192" class="c011"><sup>[192]</sup></a> Now when the young
Prince read this writ and comprehended its contents, he suspected
that it was not written concerning him and he took thought in
himself, saying, “Would Heaven I knew what I can have done by
this horseman who thus seeketh diligently to destroy my life, for
that this one had with him no daughter, he being alone and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>wending his way without any other save himself; and I made
acquaintance with him nor passed there between us a word which
was unworthy or unmeet. Now this affair must needs have one of
two faces; to wit, the first, that such mishap really did happen to
him from some youth who favoureth me and when he saw the
likeness he gave me the letter; or, on the second count, this must
be a trial and a test sent to me from Almighty Allah, and praise
be to God the Great who inspired me to open this missive. At
any rate I thank the Most Highest and laud Him for His
warding off the distress and calamity descending upon me and
wherefrom He delivered me.” Then the young Prince ceased not
wending over the wildest of wolds until he came to a mighty
grand city which he entered; and, hiring himself a lodging in a
Khan,<a id="r193"></a><a href="#f193" class="c011"><sup>[193]</sup></a> dismounted thereat; then, having tethered his mare and
fed her with a sufficiency of fodder, he fared forth to walk about
the thoroughfares. Suddenly he was met by an ancient dame
who considered him and noted him for a handsome youth and
an elegant, tall of stature and with the signs of prosperity showing
manifest between his eyes. Hereat he accosted her and questioned
her of the city-folk and their circumstances, whereto the old
woman made reply with the following purport, “Here in our city
reigneth a King of exalted dignity and he hath a daughter fair
of favour, indeed the loveliest of the folk of her time. Now
she hath taken upon herself never to intermarry with any of
mankind unless it be one who can overcome her with instances
and arguments and can return a sufficient reply to all her questions;
and this is upon condition that, should he come off vanquisher
he shall become her mate, but if vanquished she will cut off his
head, and on such wise hath she done with ninety-and-nine men
of the noblest blood, as sons of the Kings and sundry others.
Furthermore, she hath a towering castle founded upon the heights
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>that overfrown the whole of this city whence she can descry
all who pass under its walls.” As soon as the young Prince
heard these words from the old woman his heart was occupied
with the love of the King’s daughter and he passed that night
as it were to him the longsomest of nights, nor would he believe
that the next morn had morrowed. But when dawned the day
and anon showed its sheen and shone, he arose without let or
stay and after saddling his mare mounted her and turned towards
the palace belonging to the King’s daughter; and presently reaching
it, took his station at the gateway. Hereat all those present
considered him and asked him saying, “What be the cause of
thy standing hereabouts?” whereto he answered, “I desire speech
with the Princess.” But when they heard these words, all fell
to addressing him with kindly words and courteous and dissuading
him from his desire and saying, “Ho thou beautiful youngling!
fear<a id="r194"></a><a href="#f194" class="c011"><sup>[194]</sup></a> Allah and pity thyself and have ruth upon thy youth;
nor dare seek converse with this Princess, for that she hath slain
fourscore and nineteen men of the nobles and sons of the kings
and for thee sore we fear that thou shalt complete the century.”
The Prince, however, would not hear a word from them nor heed
their rede; neither would he be warned by the talk of others
than they; nay he persisted in standing at the Palace gateway.
And presently he asked admission to go in to the King’s daughter;
but this was refused by the Princess, who contented herself with
sending forth to him her Tarjumánah, her Linguist-dame, to
bespeak him and say, “Ho thou fair youth! art thou ready and
longing to affront dangers and difficulties?” He replied, “I am.”
“Then,” quoth she, “hie thee to the King the father of this
Princess and show thyself and acquaint him with thine affair and
thine aim, after which do thou bear witness against thyself in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>presence of the Kazi that an thou conquer his daughter in her
propositions and she fail of replying to a query of thine thou shalt
become her mate; whereas if she vanquish thee she shall lawfully
cut off thy head,<a id="r195"></a><a href="#f195" class="c011"><sup>[195]</sup></a> even as she hath decapitated so many before
thy time. And when this is done come thou back to us.” The
Prince forthright fared for the monarch and did as he was bidden;
then he returned to the Linguist-dame and reported all his proceedings
before the King and eke the Kazi. After this he was
led in to the presence of the Princess and with him was the
afore-mentioned Tarjumánah who brought him a cushion of silk
for the greater comfort of his sitting; and the two fell to
questioning and resolving queries and problems in full sight
of a large attendance. Began the Tarjumanah, interpreting the
words of her lady who was present, “Ho thou the Youth! my
mistress saith to thee, Do thou inform me concerning an ambulant
moving sepulchre whose inmate is alive.” He answered and
said, “The moving sepulchre is the whale that swallowed Jonas
(upon whom be the choicest of Salams!<a id="r196"></a><a href="#f196" class="c011"><sup>[196]</sup></a>), and the Prophet was
quick in the whale’s belly.” She pursued, “Tell me concerning
two combatants who fight each other but not with hands or feet,
and who withal never say a say or speak a speech.” He answered
saying, “The bull and the buffalo who encounter each other by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>ramming with horns.” She continued, “Point out to me a tract
of earth which saw not the sun save for a single time and since
that never.” He answered saying, “This be the sole of the Red
Sea when Moses the Prophet (upon whom be The Peace!) smote
it with his rod and clove it asunder so that the Children of Israel
crossed over it on dry ground, which was never seen but only
once.”<a id="r197"></a><a href="#f197" class="c011"><sup>[197]</sup></a> She resumed, “Relate to me anent that which drank
water during its life-time and ate meat after its death?” He
answered saying, “This be the Rod<a id="r198"></a><a href="#f198" class="c011"><sup>[198]</sup></a> of Moses the Prophet (upon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_99">99</span>whom be The Peace!) which, when a living branch<a id="r199"></a><a href="#f199" class="c011"><sup>[199]</sup></a> struck water
from its living root and died only when severed from the parent
tree. Now Almighty Allah cast it upon the land of Egypt by
the hand of Moses, what time this Prophet drowned Pharaoh and
his host<a id="r200"></a><a href="#f200" class="c011"><sup>[200]</sup></a> and therewith clove the Red Sea, after which that Rod
became a dragon and swallowed up the wands of all the Magicians
of Misraim.” Asked she, “Give me tidings of a thing which is
not of mankind nor of the Jánn-kind, neither of the beasts nor
of the birds?” He answered saying, “This whereof thou speakest
is that mentioned by Solomon, to wit the Louse,<a id="r201"></a><a href="#f201" class="c011"><sup>[201]</sup></a> and secondly
the Ant.” She enquired, “Tell me to what end Almighty Allah
<span class="pageno" id="Page_100">100</span>created the creation and for what aim of wisdom did He quicken
this creation and for what object did He cause death to be
followed by resurrection and resurrection by the rendering men’s
accounts?” He answered saying, “God created all creatures
that they might witness His handicraft, and he did them die
that they might behold his absolute dominion and He requickened
them to the end that they learn His All-Might, and He decreed
their rendering account that they might consider His wisdom and
His justice.” She questioned him saying, “Tell me concerning
three, of whom my first was not born of father and mother and
yet died; and my second was begotten of sire and born of
woman yet died not, and my third was born of father and mother
yet died not by human death?” He answered saying, “The first
were Adam and Eve,<a id="r202"></a><a href="#f202" class="c011"><sup>[202]</sup></a> the second was Elias<a id="r203"></a><a href="#f203" class="c011"><sup>[203]</sup></a> the Prophet and the
third was Lot’s wife who died not the death of the general, for
that she was turned into a pillar of salt.” Quoth she, “Relate
to me concerning one who in this world had two names?” and
he answered saying, “This be Jacob, sire of the Twelve Tribes, to
whom Allah vouchsafed the title of Israel, which is Man with El
or God.”<a id="r204"></a><a href="#f204" class="c011"><sup>[204]</sup></a> She said, “Inform me concerning the Nákús, or the
Gong,<a id="r205"></a><a href="#f205" class="c011"><sup>[205]</sup></a> who was the inventor thereof and at what time was it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>first struck in this world?” He answered saying, “The Gong
was invented by Noah, who first smote upon it in the Ark.”
And after this she stinted not to question him nor he to ree her
riddles until evening fell, when quoth the King’s daughter to the
Linguist-dame, “Say thou to the young man that he may now
depart, and let him come to me betimes next morning when, if
I conquer him, I will give him drink of the cup his fellows
drained; and, should he vanquish me, I will become his wife.”
Then the Tarjumánah delivered her message word for word, and
the Youth went forth from the Princess with fire aflame in his
heart and spent the longest of nights hardly believing that the
morn would morrow. But when day broke and the dawn came
with its sheen and shone upon all mankind, he arose from his
sleep and fared with the first light to the palace where the King’s
daughter bade the Linguist-dame introduce him, and when he
came in ordered him be seated. As soon as he had taken seat
she gave her commands to the Tarjumanah, who said, “My lady
directeth thee to inform her what may be the tree bearing a
dozen boughs, each clothed with thirty leaves and these of two
colours, one half white and the other moiety black?” He answered
saying, “Now that tree is the year, and its twelve branches are
the dozen months, while the thirty leaves upon each of these
are the thirty white days and the thirty black nights.” Hereat
quoth she, “Tell me, what tree was it bore many a bough and
manifold leaves which presently became flesh and blood?” He
answered saying, “This was the Rod of Moses the Prophet (upon
whom be The Peace!) which was at first a tree but which after
cutting became a serpent with flesh and blood.” Continued she,
“Inform me what became of Moses’ Rod and Noah’s Ark, and
where now be they?” He answered saying, “They are at this
tide sunken in the Lake of Tabariyyah,<a id="r206"></a><a href="#f206" class="c011"><sup>[206]</sup></a> and both, at the end of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>time will be brought out by a man hight Al-Násirí.<a id="r207"></a><a href="#f207" class="c011"><sup>[207]</sup></a>” She pursued,
“Acquaint me with spun yarn, whence did it originate and
who was it first practised spinning the same?” He answered,
saying, “Almighty Allah from the beginning of mankind ordered
the Archangel Gabriel to visit Eve and say to her:—Spin for thyself
and for Adam waistcloths wherewith ye may veil your persons.”<a id="r208"></a><a href="#f208" class="c011"><sup>[208]</sup></a>
She enquired, “Tell me concerning the Asáfír,<a id="r209"></a><a href="#f209" class="c011"><sup>[209]</sup></a> and why they were
so called, and who first named them with such name?” He
answered saying, “There was in the days of Moses the Prophet
(upon whom be The Peace!) a fowl called Fír, and in the time of
Solomon the King (upon whom be The Peace!) all the birds paid
him obedience, even as did all the beasts, and albeit each and
every created thing was subject to the Prophet, withal this Fír
would not show submission: so the Wise King sent a body
of birds to bring him into the presence, but he refused to present
himself. Presently they returned to the Prophet who asked them,
Where be Fír? and they answered, O our lord, ’Asá Fír,<a id="r210"></a><a href="#f210" class="c011"><sup>[210]</sup></a> whence
that name hath clung to the fowls.” She resumed, “Inform me
of the two Stationaries and the two Moveables and the two
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>Conjoineds and the two Disjoineds by jealousy and the twain
which be eternal Foes.” He answered saying, “Now the two
Stationaries be Heaven and Earth and the two Moveables are the
Sun and the Moon; the two Conjoineds are Night and Day and
the two Disjoineds by jealousy are the Soul and the Body and the
two Hostiles are Death and Life.”<a id="r211"></a><a href="#f211" class="c011"><sup>[211]</sup></a> On this wise the Linguist-dame
ceased not to question him and he to reply solving all her
problems until eve closed in. Then she bade him go forth that
night and on the next day come again to her. Accordingly, the
young Prince returned to his Khan and no sooner had he made
sure that the morn had morrowed than he resolved to see if that
day would bring him aught better than had come to him before.
So arising betimes he made for the palace of the King’s daughter
and was received and introduced by the Tarjumánah who
seated him as was her wont and presently she began, saying,
“My lady biddeth thee inform her of a thing which an a
man do that same ’tis unlawful; and if a man do not that same
’tis also unlawful.” He answered, saying, “I will: this be the
prayer<a id="r212"></a><a href="#f212" class="c011"><sup>[212]</sup></a> of a drunken man which is in either case illegal.” Quoth
she, “Tell me how far is the interval between Heaven and
Earth?” and he answered saying, “That bridged over by the
prayer of Moses the Prophet<a id="r213"></a><a href="#f213" class="c011"><sup>[213]</sup></a> (upon him be The Peace!) whom
Allah Almighty saved and preserved.” She said, “And how far
is it betwixt East and West?” whereto he answered saying, “The
space of a day and the course of the Sun wending from Orient
unto Occident.” Then she asked, “Let me know what was the
habit<a id="r214"></a><a href="#f214" class="c011"><sup>[214]</sup></a> of Adam in Paradise?” and he answered saying, “Adam’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_104">104</span>habit in Eden was his flowing hair.”<a id="r215"></a><a href="#f215" class="c011"><sup>[215]</sup></a> She continued, “Tell me
of Abraham the Friend (upon whom be The Peace!) how was
it that Allah chose him out and called him ‘Friend’?”<a id="r216"></a><a href="#f216" class="c011"><sup>[216]</sup></a> He
answered saying, “Verily the Lord determined to tempt and to
test him albeit he kenned right clearly that the Prophet was free
of will yet fully capable of enduring the trial; natheless, He
resolved to do on this wise that he might stablish before men the
truth of His servant’s trust in the Almighty and the fairness of
his faith and the purity of his purpose. So the Lord bade him
offer to Him his son Is’hák<a id="r217"></a><a href="#f217" class="c011"><sup>[217]</sup></a> as a Corban or Sacrifice; and of the
truth of his trust he took his child and would have slain him as a
victim. But when he drew his knife with the purpose of slaughtering
the youth he was thus addressed by the Most Highest
Creator:—Now indeed well I wot that thou gatherest<a id="r218"></a><a href="#f218" class="c011"><sup>[218]</sup></a> me and
keepest my covenant: so take thou yonder ram and slay it as a
victim in the stead of Is’hak. And after this he entituled him
‘Friend.’” She pursued, “Inform me touching the sons of
Israel how many were they at the time of the going forth from
Egypt?” He answered, saying, “When they marched out of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>Misraim-land they numbered six hundred thousand fighting<a id="r219"></a><a href="#f219" class="c011"><sup>[219]</sup></a> men
besides women and children.” She continued, “Do thou point out
to me, some place on earth which is higher than the Heavens;”
and he answered saying, “This is Jerusalem<a id="r220"></a><a href="#f220" class="c011"><sup>[220]</sup></a> the Exalted and she
standeth far above the Firmament.” Then the Youth turning to
the Linguist-dame, said, “O my lady, long and longsome hath
been the exposition of that which is between us, and were thy
lady to ask me for all time questions such as these and the like of
them, I by the All-might of Allah shall return a full and sufficient
answer to one and all. But, in lieu of so doing, I desire of thy
mistress the Princess to ask of her one question and only one;
and, if she satisfy me of the significance I claim therefor, let her
give me to drain the cup of my foregoers whom she overcame and
slew; and if she fail in the attempt she shall own herself conquered
and become my wife——and The Peace!”<a id="r221"></a><a href="#f221" class="c011"><sup>[221]</sup></a> Now this was said in
the presence of a mighty host there present, the great of them as
well as the small thereof; so the Tarjumánah answered willy-nilly,
“Say, O Youth, whatso is the will of thee and speak out
that which is in the mind of thee.” He rejoined, “Tell thy lady
that she deign enlighten me concerning a man who was in this
condition. He was born and brought up in the highest of
prosperity but Time turned upon him and Poverty mishandled
him;<a id="r222"></a><a href="#f222" class="c011"><sup>[222]</sup></a> so he mounted his father and clothed him with his mother<a id="r223"></a><a href="#f223" class="c011"><sup>[223]</sup></a>
and he fared forth to seek comfort and happiness at the hand of
Allah Almighty. Anon Death met him on the way and Doom
bore him upon his head and his courser saved him from destruction
<span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>whenas he drank water which came neither from the sky nor
from the ground. Now see thou who may be that man and do
thou give me answer concerning him.”<a id="r224"></a><a href="#f224" class="c011"><sup>[224]</sup></a> But when the Princess
heard this question, she was confused with exceeding confusion
touching the reply to be replied in presence of a posse of the
people, and she was posed and puzzled and perplext to escape the
difficulty and naught availed her save addressing the Tarjumánah
and saying, “Do thou bid this Youth wend his ways and remove
himself until the morrow.” The Linguist-dame did as she was
bidden, adding, “And on the morrow (Inshallah!) there shall be
naught save weal;” and the Prince went forth leaving the folk
aghast at the question he had urged upon the King’s daughter.
But as soon as he left her the young lady commanded the Tarjumánah
to let slaughter somewhat of the most toothsome poultry
and to prepare them for food as her mistress might direct her;
together with dainty meats and delicate sweetmeats and the finest
fruits fresh and dried and all manner of other eatables and drinkables,
and lastly to take a skin-bottle filled with good old wine.
Then she changed her usual garb and donned the most sumptuous
dress of all her gear; and, taking her Duenna and favourite handmaiden
with a few of her women for comitive, she repaired to the
quarters of the Youth, the King’s son; and the time of her visit
was the night-tide. Presently, reaching the Khan she said to her
guardian, “Go thou in to him alone whilst I hide me somewhere
behind the door and do thou sit between his hands;” after which
she taught the old woman all she desired her do of dissimulation
and artifice. The slave obeyed her mistress and going in accosted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>the young man with the salam; and, seating herself before him,
said, “Ho thou the Youth! Verily there is here a lovely damsel,
delightsome and perfect of qualities, whose peer is not in her age,
and well nigh able is she to make the sun fare backwards<a id="r225"></a><a href="#f225" class="c011"><sup>[225]</sup></a> and to
illumine the universe in lieu thereof. Now when thou wast wont
to visit us in the apartment of the Princess, this maiden looked
upon thee and found thee a fair youth; so her heart loved thee
with excessive love and desired thee with exceeding desire and to
such degree that she insisted upon accompanying me and she hath
now taken station at thy door longing to enter. So do thou grant
her permission that she come in and appear in thy presence and
then retire to some privacy where she may stand in thy service,
a slave to thy will.”<a id="r226"></a><a href="#f226" class="c011"><sup>[226]</sup></a> The Prince replied, “Whoso seeketh us let
enter with weal and welfare, and well come and welcome and fair
welcome to each and every of such guests.” Hereat the Princess
went in as did all those who were with her, and presently after
taking seat they brought out and set before the Youth their whole
store of edibles and potables and the party fell to eating and drinking
and converse, exchanging happy sayings blended with wit and
disport and laughter, while the Princess made it her especial task
to toy with her host deeming that he knew her not to be the King’s
daughter. He also stinted not to take his pleasure with her; and
on this wise they feasted and caroused and enjoyed themselves
and were cheered and the converse between them was delightful.
The Duenna, however, kept plying the Prince with wine, mere and
pure, until she had made him drunken and his carousal had so
mastered him that he required her of her person: however she
refused herself and questioned him of the enigma wherewith he
had overcome her mistress; whilst he, for stress of drunkenness,
was incapacitated by stammering to explain her aught thereof.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>Hereupon the Princess, having doffed her upper dress, propped
herself sideways upon a divan cushion and stretched herself at full
length and the Youth for the warmth of his delight in her and his
desire to her anon recovering his speech explained to her the reply
to his riddle. The King’s daughter then joyed with mighty great
joy as though she had won the world universal;<a id="r227"></a><a href="#f227" class="c011"><sup>[227]</sup></a> and, springing
to her feet incontinently, of her extreme gladness she would not
delay to finish her disport with her wooer; but ere the morning
morrowed she departed and entered her palace. Now in so doing
she clean forgot her outer robes and the wine-service and what
remained of meat and drink. The Youth had been overcome with
sleep and after slumbering he awoke at dawn when he looked
round and saw none of the company about him: withal he
recognised the princely garments which were of the most
sumptuous and costly, robes of brocade and sendal and suchlike,
together with jewels and adornments; and scattered about lay
sundry articles of the wine-service and fragments of the food they
had brought with them. And from these signs of things forgotten
he learnt that the King’s daughter had visited him in person and
he was certified that she had beguiled him with her wiles until she
had wrung from him the reply to his question. So as soon as it
was morning-tide he arose and went, as was his wont, to the
Princess’s palace where he was met by the Tarjumánah who said
to him, “O Youth, is it thy pleasure that my lady expound to
thee her explanation of the enigma yesterday proposed by thee?”
“I will tell the very truth,” answered he; “and relate to thee what
befel me since I saw you last, and ’twas this. When I left you
there came to me a lovely bird, delightsome and perfect of charms,
and I indeed entertained her with uttermost honour and worship;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>we ate and we drank together, but at night she shook her feathers
and flew away from me. And if she deny this I will produce
her plumage before her father and all present.” Now when the
Sovran, the sire of the Princess, heard these words concerning his
daughter, to wit, that the youth had conquered her in her contention
and that she had fared to his quarters to the end that she
might wring from him an explanation of the riddle which she was
unable to ree or reply thereto, he would do naught else save to
summon the Cohen<a id="r228"></a><a href="#f228" class="c011"><sup>[228]</sup></a> and the Lords of his land and the Grandees
of his realm and the Notables of his kith and kin. And when the
Priest and all made act of presence, he told them the whole tale
first and last; namely, the conditions to the Youth conditioned,
that if overcome by his daughter and unable to answer her
questions he should be let drain the cup of destruction like his
fellows, and if he overcame her he should claim her to wife.
Furthermore he declared that the Youth had answered, with full
and sufficient answer, all he had been asked without doubt or
hesitation; while at last he had proposed to her an enigma which
she had been powerless to solve; and in this matter he had
vanquished her twice (he having answered her and she having
failed to answer him) “For which reason,” concluded the King,
“’tis only right that he marry her; even as was the condition
between them twain; and it becometh our first duty to adjudge
their contention and decide their case according to covenant and
he being doubtless the conqueror to bid write his writ of marriage
with her. But what say ye?” They replied, “This is the
rightest of redes; moreover the Youth, a fair and a pleasant,
becometh her well and she likewise besitteth him; and their lot
is a wondrous.” So they bade write the marriage writ and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>Cohen, arising forthright, pronounced the union auspicious and
began blessing and praying for the pair and all present. In
due time the Prince went in to her and consummated the
marriage according to the custom stablished by Allah and His
Holy Law; and thereafter he related to his bride all that had
betided him, from beginning to end, especially how he had sold
his parents to one of the Kings. Now when she heard these
words, she had ruth upon his case and soothed his spirit saying
to him, “Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes clear and cool
of tear.” Then, after a little while the Princess bestowed upon
her bridegroom a mint of money that he might fare forth and
free his father and his mother. Accordingly the Prince, accepting
her largesse, sought the King to whom he had pledged his parents
(and they were still with him in all weal and welfare) and going
in to him made his salam and kissed ground and told him the
whole tale of the past and the conditions of death or marriage
he had made with the King’s daughter and of his wedding her
after overcoming her in contention. So the monarch honoured
him with honour galore than which naught could be more; and,
when the Prince paid him over the moneys, he asked, “What be
these dirhams?” “The price of my parents thou paidest to me,”
answered the other. But the King exclaimed, “I gave thee not
to the value of thy father and mother moneys of such amount as
this sum. I only largessed thee with a mare and a suit of clothes
which was not defraying a debt but presenting thee with a present
and thereby honouring thee with due honour. Then Alhamdolillah—laud
be to the Lord, who preserved thee and enabled thee to
win thy wish, and now arise and take thy parents and return
in safety to thy bride.” The Prince hereupon thanked him and
praised Allah for the royal guerdon and favours and the fair treatment
wherewith he had been entreated; after which he craved
leave to receive his parents in charge and wend his ways. And
when permission was granted to him, he wished all good wishes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>to the King and taking his father and his mother in weal and
welfare he went his ways with them, in joy and gladness and
gratitude for all blessings and benefits by Allah upon him bestowed,
till he had returned to his bride. Here he found that his father-in-law
had deceased during his absence, so he took seat in lieu of
him upon the throne of the kingdom; and he and his consort,
during all the days of their life in this world, ceased not eating and
drinking in health and well-being and eating and drinking in joy
and happiness and bidding and forbidding until they quitted this
mundane scene to the safeguard of the Lord God. And here
endeth and is perfected the history of the Youth, the King’s son,
and the sale of his parents and his falling into the springes of the
Princess who insisted upon proposing problems to all her wooers
with the condition that if they did not reply she would do them
drain the cup of destruction and on this wise had slain a many
of men; and, in fine, how she was worsted by and she fell to
the lot of this youth whom Allah gifted with understanding to
ree all her riddles and who had confounded her with
his question whereto she availed not to reply;
so she was contented to marry him and he,
when his father-in-law died,
succeeded to the kingdom
which he ruled
so well.</p>

<p class="c016">The Músà (Moses) of the Moslems is borrowed from Jewish sources, the Pentateuch
and especially the Talmud, with a trifle of Gnosticism which, hinted at in the Koran
(chapt. xviii), is developed by later writers, making him the “external” man, while Khizr,
the Green prophet, is the internal. But they utterly ignore Manetho whose account of the
Jewish legislator (Josephus against Apion, i. cc. 26, 27) shows the other or Egyptian part.
Moses, by name Osarsiph = Osiris-Sapi, Osiris of the underworld, which some translate
rich (Osii) in food (Siph, Seph, or Zef) was nicknamed Mosheh from the Heb. Mashah = to draw out, because drawn from the water<a id="r230"></a><a href="#f230" class="c011"><sup>[230]</sup></a> (or rather from the Koptic Mo = water,
ushe = saved). He became a priest at An or On (Heliopolis), after studying the learning
of the Egyptians. Presently he was chosen chief by the “lepers and other unclean
persons” who had been permitted by King Amenophis to occupy the city Avaris lately
left desolate by the Shepherd Kings. Osarsiph ordained the polity and laws of his
followers, forbidding them to worship the Egyptian gods and enjoining them to slay and
sacrifice the sacred animals. They were joined by the “unclean of the Egyptians” and
by their kinsmen of the Shepherds, and treated the inhabitants with a barbarity more
execrable than that of the latter, setting fire to cities and villages, casting the Egyptian
priests and prophets out of their country, and compelling Amenophis to fall back upon
Ethiopia. After some years of disorder Sethos (also called Ramesses from his father
Rampses) son of Amenophis came down with the King from Ethiopia leading great united
forces, and, “encountering the Shepherds and the unclean people, they defeated them
and slew multitudes of them, and pursued the remainder to the borders of Syria.” Josephus
relates this account of Manetho, which is apparently truthful, with great indignation.
For the prevalence of leprosy we have the authority of the Hebrews themselves, and
Pliny (xxvi. 2) speaking of Rubor Ægyptus, evidently white leprosy ending in the black,
assures us that it was “natural to the Ægyptians,” adding a very improbable detail,
namely that the kings cured it by balneæ (baths) of human blood.<a id="r231"></a><a href="#f231" class="c011"><sup>[231]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c012">Schiller (in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Sendung Moses</span>”) argues that the mission of the Jewish lawgiver,
as adopted son (the real son?) of Pharaoh’s daughter, became “learned in all the
wisdom of the Egyptians,” by receiving the priestly education of the royal princes, and
that he had advanced from grade to grade in the religious mysteries, even to the highest,
in which the great truth of the One Supreme, the omniscient, omnipotent God was imparted,
as the sublime acme of all human knowledge, thus attributing to Moses before
his flight into Midian, an almost modern conception of an essentially anthropomorphous
Deity.</p>

<p class="c012"><span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>Further, that his conscious mission when he returned to Egypt was not merely the
deliverance of his people from the Egyptian yoke, but the revelation to them of this
great conception, and so the elevation of that host of slaves to the position of a nation, to
whose every member the highest mystery of religion should be known and whose institutions
should be based upon it. It is remarkable that Schiller should have accepted the
fables of Manetho as history, that he should not have suspected the fact that the Egyptian
priest wrote from motives of personal spite and jealousy, and with the object of poisoning
the mind of Ptolemy against the learned Jews with whom he stood on terms of personal
friendship. Thus he not only accepts the story that the Hebrews were expelled from
Egypt because of the almost universal spread of leprosy among them, but explains at
length why that loathsome and horrible disease should have so prevailed. Still Schiller’s
essay, written with his own charming eloquence, is a magnificent eulogy of the founder
of the Hebrew nation.</p>

<p class="c012">Goethe (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Israel in der Wüste</span>”) on the other hand, with curious ingenuity, turns every
thing to the prejudice of the “headstrong man” Moses, save that he does grant him a vivid
sentiment of justice. He makes him both by nature and education a grand, strong man,
but brutal (<em>roh</em>) withal. His killing the Egyptian is a secret murder; “his dauntless fist
gains him the favour of a Midianitish priest-prince ... under the pretence of a
general festival, gold and silver dishes are swindled (by the Jews under Moses’s instigation)
from their neighbours, and at the moment when the Egyptians believe the Israelites
to be occupied in harmless feastings, a reversed Sicilian vesper is executed; the stranger
murders the native, the guest the host; and, with a horrible cunning, only the first-born are
destroyed to the end that, in a land where the first-born enjoyed such superior rights,
the selfishness of the younger sons might come into play, and instant punishment be
avoided by hasty flight. The artifice succeeds, the assassins are thrust out instead of
being chastised.” (Quoted from pp. 99–100 “The Hebrews and the Red Sea,” by
Alexander W. Thayer; Andover, Warren F. Draper, 1883). With respect to the census
of the Exodus, my friend Mr. Thayer, who has long and conscientiously studied the
subject, kindly supplied me with the following notes and permitted their publication.</p>

<p class="c012">Assuming that the Hebrew records, as we have them, are in the main true, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>
historic, a careful search must reveal some one topic concerning which all the passages
relating to it agree at least substantially. Such a topic is the genealogies, precisely that
which Philippsohn the great Jewish Rabbi, Dr. Robinson, of the Palestine researches,
and all the Jewish and Christian commentators—I know no exception—with one accord
reject! Look at these two columns, A. being the passages containing the genealogies,
B. the passages on which the rejection of them is based:</p>

<p class="c012">1. As between the two, the column A. is in my opinion more trustworthy than B.</p>

<p class="c012">2. By all the genealogies of the Davidian line we have Judah No. 1, Solomon No. 12.
By Ezra’s genealogy of his own family we have Levi No. 1, and Azariah (Solomon’s
High Priest) No. 12. They agree perfectly.</p>

<p class="c012">3. If there were 400 years of <em>Hebrew</em> (Bene Jacob) slavery between the death of
Joseph and the Exodus, there were 400 - 80 = 320, between Joseph’s death and the
birth of Moses. If this was so there is no truth in the accounts of Moses and Aaron
being the great-grandchildren of Levi (Levi, Kohath, Amram, Aaron and Moses). In
fact, if Dr. Robinson be correct in saying that at least six generations are wanting in the
genealogies of David (to fill the 400 years) the same must be lacking in <em>all</em> the early
genealogies. Reductio ad absurdum!</p>

<p class="c012">4. Jacob, a young man, we will say of 40, is sent to Laban for a wife. He remains
in Padan Aram twenty years (Gen. xxxi. 38), where all his sons except Benjamin were
born, that is, before he was 60. At 30 he joined Joseph in Egypt (Gen. xlvii. 9). Joseph,
therefore, born in Padan Aram was now, instead of 40, over 70 years old! That this is so,
is certain. In Judah’s exquisite pleadings (Gen. xliv. 18–34) he speaks of Benjamin as
“the child of Jacob’s old age,” “a little one,” and seven times he calls him “the
lad.” Benjamin is some years younger than Joseph, but when the migration into Egypt
takes place—a few weeks after Judah’s speech—Benjamin comes as father of <em>ten</em> sons
(Gen. xlvi. 21), but here <em>Bene</em> Benjamin is used in its broad sense of “descendants,”
for in 1 Chron. vii. 6–12 we find that the “Bene” were sons, grandsons and <em>great</em>-grandsons.
To hold that Joseph at 40 had a younger brother who was a great-grandfather,
is, of course, utterly absurd.</p>

<p class="c012">5. According to Gen. xv. 18, the Exodus was to take place in the fourth generation
<em>born in Egypt</em>, as I understand it.</p>

<p class="c012">A conspicuous character in Numbers (xiii. 6, 30; xiv. 24, etc.) is Caleb. In the first
chapter of Judges Caleb still appears, and Othniel, the son of his younger brother Kenaz
<span class="pageno" id="Page_115">115</span>is the first of the so-called Judges (Jud. iii. 9). This also disposes of the 400 years and
confirms the view that the Exodus took place in the fourth generation born in Egypt.
Other similar proofs may be omitted—these are amply sufficient.</p>

<p class="c012">6. What, then, was the origin of the notion of the 400 years of Hebrew slavery?</p>

<p class="c012">If the Egyptian inscriptions and papyri prove anything, it is this: that from the
subjugation of Palestine by one of the Thotmes down to the great invasion of the hordes
from Asia Minor in the reign of Rameses III., that country had never ceased to be a
Pharaonic province; that during these four or five centuries every attempt to throw off
the yoke had been crushed and its Semitic peoples deported to Egypt as slaves; that
multitudes of them joined in the Exodus under Moses, and became incorporated with the
Hebrews under the constitution and code adopted at Horeb (=Sinai? or Jebel Aráif?)
These people became “Seed of Abraham,” “Children of Israel,” by adoption, to which
I have no doubt, Paul refers in the “adoption” of Romans viii. 15–23; ix. 4; Gal.
iv. 5; Eph. i. 5. In the lapse of ages this distinction between Bene Israel and Bene
Jacob was forgotten, and therefore the very uncritical Masorites in their edition of the
Old Testament “confounded the confusion” in this matter. With the disappearance of
the 400 years and of the supposed two or three centuries covered by the book of Judges,
the genealogies stand as facts. The mistake in the case of the Judges is in supposing
them to have been consecutive, when, in fact, as the subjugations by neighbouring
peoples were local and extended only over one or two tribes, half a dozen of them
may have been contemporaneous.</p>

<p class="c012">7. Aaron and Moses were by their father Amram, greatgrandchildern of Levi—by
their mother’s his grandchildren (Ex. vi. 20). Joseph lived to see his own great-grandchildren.
Moses must have been born <em>before</em> Joseph’s death.</p>

<p class="c012">8. There is one point determined in which the Hebrew and the Egyptian chronologers
coincide. It is the invasion of Judea by Shishak of Egypt in the fifth year of Rehoboam,
son of Solomon (1 Kings xiv. 25). Supposing the Egyptian chronology from the time of
Minephtah II. to be in the main correct, as given by Brugsch and others, the thirteen
generations, Judah—Rehoboam, allowing three to a century, take us back to just that
Minephtah. In his reign, according to Brugsch, that Pharaoh sent breadstuffs to the
Chittim in “the time of famine.” The Hebrew records and traditions connect Joseph’s
prime ministry with a famine. By the genealogies it could have been only this in the
time of Minephtah.</p>

<p class="c012">9. The Bene Jacob were but temporary sojourners in Goshen and always intended to
return to Canaan. They were independent and had the right to do so. See what
Joseph says in Gen. i. 24–25. But before this design was executed came the great
irruption of the Northern hordes, which broke the power of the Chittim and Philistia
and devastated or depopulated all Palestine, in the time of Ramses III. Here was an
opportunity for the Bene Jacob to enlarge their plans and to devise the conquest and
possession of Palestine. According to Josephus, supported by Stephen (Acts vii. 22),
Moses was a man “mighty in works”—a man of military fame. The only reasonable
way of understanding the beginning of the Exodus story, is to suppose, that, in the
weakened condition of Ramses III., the Hebrew princes began to intrigue with the
enslaved Semites—the Ruthenu of the Egyptian inscriptions—and this being discovered
by the Pharaoh, Moses was compelled to fly. Meantime the intrigues were continued and
when the time for action came, under one of Ramses’ weak successors, Moses was recalled
and took command.</p>

<p class="c012">10. This prepares us for the second query, which you proposed, that is as to the
numbers who joined in the Exodus.</p>

<p class="c012">The Masoretic text, from which the English version of the Hebrew records is made,
gives the result of the census at Sinai (=Horeb) as being 603,550 men, “twenty years
<span class="pageno" id="Page_116">116</span>old and upwards, that were able to go forth to war in Israel”—the tribe of Levi <em>not</em>
included. On this basis it has been generally stated, that the number of the Bene Israel
at the Exodus was three millions. Of late I find that two millions is the accepted
number. The absurdity of even this aggregate is manifest. How could such a vast
multitude be subsisted? How kept in order? How compelled to observe sanitary
regulations? Moreover, in the then enfeebled state of Egypt, why should 603,550 armed
men not have marched out without ceremony? Why ask permission to go to celebrate a
sacrifice to their God?</p>

<p class="c012">But there is another series of objections to these two millions, which I have never
seen stated or even hinted, to which I pray your attention.</p>

<p class="c012">The area of Palestine differs little from that of the three American States,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut, the most densely peopled of the Union,
containing by the last census a population of somewhat less than two and a half
millions.</p>

<p class="c012">By the second Hebrew census (Numb. xxvi.) taken just before the death of Moses,
the army was 601,730; from which the inference has always been drawn, that at least
2,000,000, in the aggregate, Levites 23,000 <em>males</em> still excepted, entered and possessed
the conquered territories.</p>

<p class="c012">Take now one of the late maps of Palestine and mark upon it the boundaries of the
tribes as given in the book of Joshua. This second census gives the number of each
<em>tribal</em> army to be inserted in each tribal territory Reuben, 43,750; Judah, 76,500;
Benjamin, 45,600, etc., etc. By Josh. xii. the land was then divided between some
40 petty kings and peoples, 31 of whom are named as having been subjected. If, now,
Joshua’s army numbered over 600,000, why was not the conquest made complete?
Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Connecticut are divided into 27 counties. Suppose,
now, that these counties were each a separate and independent little kingdom dependent
upon itself, for defence, what resistance could be made to an army of 600,000 men, all of
them grown up during forty years of life in a camp, and in the full vigour of manhood?
And yet Joshua was unable to complete his conquest! Again, the first subjugation of a
part of the newly-conquered territory as noted in the book of Judges, was Judah and
Simeon by a king of Edom.<a id="r232"></a><a href="#f232" class="c011"><sup>[232]</sup></a> If Judah could put an army into the field of 76,500, and
Simeon 22,500, their subjugation by a king of Edom is incredible, and the story absurd.
Next comes King Eglon of Moab and subjugates the tribes of Reuben and Gad, east of
the Dead Sea and the Jordan. And yet Reuben has an army of over 43,000, and Gad
45,000. And so on.</p>

<p class="c012">Accepting the statement that Moses led over 600,000 men “able to go to war” out
of Egypt, and Joshua an equal number to the conquest of Canaan, the story of the
Exodus, of that conquest and of the subsequent subjugations of various tribes by the
neighbouring kings are all nonsense; the books of Joshua and Judges are incredible.
The difficulty is fully met and overcome, if we suppose the number to have been
exaggerated, as it would be by adding a cypher to the right of a line of Arabic numerals,
by which 60,000 is made 600,000; the 76,500 warriors of Judah are reduced to 7,650,
and so on.</p>

<p class="c012">With an army of 60,000 only, and an aggregate of half a million of people led out of
Egypt, all the history becomes instantly rational and trustworthy.</p>

<p class="c012">There remains one more bubble to be exploded.</p>

<p class="c012">Look at these figures, in which a quadruple increase—at least 25 per centum too
great—is granted.<a id="r233"></a><a href="#f233" class="c011"><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c012">Were these people, while Joseph is still alive, the subjects of slavery as described in
Ex. i.? Did they build Pithom and Ramses, store-cities?</p>

<p class="c012">The number is sufficient to lead in the great enterprise and to control the mixed
multitude which was at Sinai, adopted as “Bene <em>Israel</em>,” “Seed of Abraham,” and
divided among and incorporated with the tribes; but not sufficient to warrant the
supposition that with so small a force the Hebrew leaders could for a moment have
entertained the project of conquering Palestine.</p>

<p class="c012">A word more on the statement in Ex. i. 11: “And they built for Pharaoh store-cities,
Pithom and Ramses.” All Egyptologists agree that these cities were built by
Ramses II., or certainly not later than his reign. If the Hebrew genealogies are
authentic, this was long before the coming of Jacob and his sons into Egypt.</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE TALE OF THE WARLOCK AND THE YOUNG COOK OF BAGHDAD.</h2>
</div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_121">121</span><b>Here we begin with the aidance of Allah Almighty, the Tale of the Warlock and the Young Cook of Baghdad.</b><a id="r234"></a><a href="#f234" class="c011"><sup>[234]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">It is related (and Allah is All-knowing!) of a certain man which
was a Warlock, that Destiny drave him from town to town until
at last he entered Baghdad-city and dismounted at a Khán of the
Khans where he spent the night of arrival. Then, rising betimes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_122">122</span>next morning, he walked about the highways and wandered around
the lanes and he stinted not passing from market-street to market-street,
solacing himself with a sight of many places, till he reached
the Long Bazar, whence he could descry the whole site of the city.
Now he narrowly considered the land, and, lo and behold! it was
a capital sans peer amongst the cities, wherethrough coursed the
Dajlah River blended with the River Furát<a id="r235"></a><a href="#f235" class="c011"><sup>[235]</sup></a> and over the united
stream were thrown seven bridges of boats; all these were bound
one to other for the folk to pass over on their several pursuits,
especially for the pleasure-seekers who fared forth to the palm-orchards
and the vergiers abounding in fruits while the birds were
hymning Allah, the Sole, the All-conquering. Now one day as this
Warlock was amusing himself amongst the markets he passed
by the shop of a Cook before whom were set for sale dressed
meats of all kinds and colours;<a id="r236"></a><a href="#f236" class="c011"><sup>[236]</sup></a> and, looking at the youth, he saw
that he was rising fourteen and beautiful as the moon on the
fourteenth night; and he was elegant and habited in a habit as it
had just come from the tailor’s hand for its purity and excellent fit,
and one had said that he (the artisan) had laboured hard thereat, for
the sheen of it shimmered like unto silver.<a id="r237"></a><a href="#f237" class="c011"><sup>[237]</sup></a> Then the Warlock
considering the face of this Cook saw his colour wan as the hue of
metal leaves<a id="r238"></a><a href="#f238" class="c011"><sup>[238]</sup></a> and he was lean of limb;<a id="r239"></a><a href="#f239" class="c011"><sup>[239]</sup></a> so he took station facing
him and said to him, “The Peace be upon thee, O my brother,”
and said the other in reply, “And upon thee be The Peace and
the ruth of Allah and His blessings: so well come to thee and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>welcome and fair welcome. Honour me, O my lord, by suffering me
to serve thee with the noonday meal.” Hereat the Wizard entered
the shop and the Kitchener took up two or three platters white
as the whitest silver; and, turning over into each one a different
kind of meat set them between the hands of the stranger who said
to him, “Seat thee, O my son.” And when his bidding was
obeyed he added, “I see thee ailing and thy complexion is yellow
exceedingly: what be this hath affected thee and what is thy disorder
and what limb of thy limbs paineth thee and is it long since
thou art in such case?” Now when the Cook heard this say he
drew a sigh of regret from the depths of his heart and the soles of
his feet and quoth he weeping, “Allah upon thee, O my lord,
remind me not of that hath betided me!” But quoth the other
“Tell me what may be thy disease and whereof dost thou complain;
nor conceal from me thy pain; for that I am a physician
and by aidance of Allah an experienced; and I have a medicine
for thy malady.” Hereat the youth fell to moaning and groaning
and presently replied, “In very sooth, O my lord, I have nor pain
nor complaint, save that I am a lover.” The Warlock asked, “Art
thou indeed a lover?” whereto the Cook make answer, “And not
only a lover but a lover parted from his beloved.” “On whom
hangeth thy heart, say me?” continued the Mediciner and the
youth replied, “Leave me for the nonce till such time as I am quit
of my business, and return to me about mid-afternoon, that I may
inform thee of mine affair and acquaint thee with the case I am
in.” The Warlock rejoined, “Arise now to thy work lest it be
miswrought by loitering;” and so saying he ate whatso of meats
had been served up to him and fared forth to thread the Bazars of
Baghdad and solace himself by seeing the city. But when it was
the hour of Al-’Asr—the mid-afternoon prayer—he went back to
the Cook and found that by this time he had wrought all his work,
and as soon as the youth sighted him he rejoiced in him and his
spirits were cheered and he said in his mind, “Haply joy shall
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>come to me from the healing hand of this Mediciner;” so he shut
his shop and taking with him his customer hied him to his own
home. Now this young Kitchener was of amplest means which he
had inherited from either parent; so as soon as they entered his
quarters he served up food and the two ate and drank and were
gladdened and comforted. After this quoth the guest to his host,
“Now relate to me the manner of thy story and what is the cause
of thy disorder?” “O my lord,” quoth the youth, “I must inform
thee that the Caliph Al-Mu’tazid bi’llah,<a id="r240"></a><a href="#f240" class="c011"><sup>[240]</sup></a> the Commander of the
Faithful, hath a daughter fair of favour, and gracious of gesture;
beautiful, delightsome and dainty of waist and flank, a maiden in
whom all the signs and signals of loveliness are present, and the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> is independent of description: seer never saw her
like and relator never related of aught that eveneth her in stature
and seemlihead and graceful bearing of head.” Now albeit a store
of suitors galore, the grandees and the Kings, asked her from the
Caliph, her sire refused to part with her, nor gave her neither
would he give her to any one thereof. And every Friday when
fare the folk to the Mosques that they pray the prayers of
meeting-day, all the merchants and men who buy and sell and the
very artisans and what not, leave their shops and warehouses<a id="r241"></a><a href="#f241" class="c011"><sup>[241]</sup></a> and
taverns<a id="r242"></a><a href="#f242" class="c011"><sup>[242]</sup></a> unbolted and wide open and flock to congregational devotions.
And at such time this rare maiden cometh down from her
palace and solaceth herself with beholding the Bazars and anon
she entereth the Hammam and batheth therein and straightway
goeth forth and fareth homewards. But one Friday said I to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>myself, “I will not go to the Mosque, for I would fain look upon
her with a single look;” and when prayer-time came and the folk
flocked to the fane for divine service, I hid myself within my shop.
Presently that august damsel appeared with a comitive of forty
handmaidens all as full moons newly risen and each fairer than
her fellows, while she amiddlemost rained light upon them as she
were the irradiating sun; and the bondswomen would have kept
her from sight by thronging around her and they carried her
skirts by means of bent rods<a id="r243"></a><a href="#f243" class="c011"><sup>[243]</sup></a> golden and silvern. I looked at
her but one look when straightway my heart fell in love to her
burning as a live coal and from mine eyes tears railed and until
now I am still in that same yearning, and what yearning!” And
so saying the youth cried out with an outcry whereby his soul was
like to leave his body. “Is this case still thy case?” asked the
Warlock, and the youth answered, “Yes, O my lord;” when the
other enquired, “An I bring thee and her together what wilt
thou give me?” and the young Cook replied, “My money and my
life which shall be between thy hands!” Hereupon quoth the
Mediciner, “Up with thee and bring me a phial of metal and
seven needles and a piece of fresh Lign-aloes;<a id="r244"></a><a href="#f244" class="c011"><sup>[244]</sup></a> also a bit of
cooked meat,<a id="r245"></a><a href="#f245" class="c011"><sup>[245]</sup></a> and somewhat of sealing-clay and the shoulder-blade
of a sheep together with felt and sendal of seven kinds.”
The youth fared forth and did his bidding, when the Sage took
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>the shoulder-blades and wrote upon them Koranic versets and
adjurations which would please the Lord of the Heavens and,
wrapping them in felt, swathed them with silken stuff of seven-fold
sorts. Then, taking the phial he thrust the seven needles into the
green Lign-aloes and set it in the cooked meat which he made fast
with the sealing-clay. Lastly he conjured over these objects with a
Conjuration<a id="r246"></a><a href="#f246" class="c011"><sup>[246]</sup></a> which was, “I have knocked, I have knocked at the
hall doors of Earth to summon the Jánn, and the Jánn have
knocked for the Jánn against the Shaytán.” Hereat appeared to
me the son of Al bin Imrán<a id="r247"></a><a href="#f247" class="c011"><sup>[247]</sup></a> with a snake and baldrick’d with a
basilisk and cried:—Who be this trader and son of a slave-girl
who hath knocked at the ground for us this evening? Then do
thou, O youth, reply:—I am a lover and of age youthful and my
love is to a young lady; and unto your gramarye I have had
recourse, O folk of manliness and generosity and masterful deeds:
so work ye with me and confirm mine affair and aid me in this
matter. See ye not how Such-an-one, daughter of Such-an-one,
oppression and wrong to me hath done, nor is she with me in
affection as she was anon? They shall answer thee:—Let it be,
as is said, in the tail;<a id="r248"></a><a href="#f248" class="c011"><sup>[248]</sup></a> then do thou set the objects upon a fire
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>exceeding fierce and recite then over them:—This be the business;
and were Such-an-one, daughter of Such-an-one, within the well of
Káshán<a id="r249"></a><a href="#f249" class="c011"><sup>[249]</sup></a> or in the city Ispahan or in the towns of men who with
cloaks buttoned tight and ever ready good-fame to blight,<a id="r250"></a><a href="#f250" class="c011"><sup>[250]</sup></a> let her
come forth and seek union with the beloved. Whereto she will reply:—“Thou
art the lord and I am the bondswoman.” Now the youth
abode marvelling at such marvel-forms and the Warlock having
repeated to him these words three times, turned to him and said,
“Arise to thy feet and perfume and fumigate thy person and don
thy choicest dress and dispread thy bed, for at this very hour thou
shalt see thy mistress by thy side.” And so saying the Sage cast
out of hand the shoulder-blades and set the phial upon the fire.
Thereupon the youth arose without stay or delay and bringing a
bundle of raiment the rarest, he spread it and habited himself, doing
whatso the Wizard had bidden him; withal could he not believe
that his mistress would appear. However ere a scanty space of
time had elapsed, lo and behold! the young lady bearing her bedding<a id="r251"></a><a href="#f251" class="c011"><sup>[251]</sup></a>
and still sleeping passed through the house-door and she was
bright and beautiful as the easting sun. But when the youth the
Cook sighted her, he was perplext and his wits took flight with his
sense and he cried aloud saying, “This be naught save a wondrous
matter!” “And the same,” quoth the Sage, “is that requiredst
thou.” Quoth the Cook, “And thou, O my lord, art of the
Hallows of Allah,” and kissed his hand and thanked him for his
kindly deed. “Up with thee and take thy pleasure,” cried the
Warlock; so the lover crept under the coverlet into the bed and
he threw his arms round the fair one and kissed her between the
eyes; after which he bussed her on the mouth. She sensed a
sensation in herself and straightway awaking opened her eyes and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>beheld a youth embracing her, so she asked him, “Ho thou, who
art thou?” Answered he, “One by thine eyes a captive ta’en and
of thy love the slain and of none save thyself the fain.” Hereat
she looked at him with a look which her heart for love-longing
struck and again asked him, “O my beloved; say me then, who
art thou, a being of mankind or of Jánn-kind?” whereto he
answered, “I am human and of the most honourable.” She
resumed, “Then who was it brought me hither to thee?” and he
responded, “The Angels and the Spirits, the Jinns and the Jánn.”
“Then I swear thee, O my dearling,” quoth she, “that thou bid
them bear me hither to thine arms every night,” and quoth he,
“Hearkening and obeying, O my lady, and for me also this be the
bourne of all wishes.” Then, each having kissed other, they slept
in mutual embrace until dawn. But when the morning morrowed
and showed its sheen and shone, behold, the Warlock appeared
and, calling the youth who came to him with a smiling face, said
to him, “How was it with thy soul this night?”<a id="r252"></a><a href="#f252" class="c011"><sup>[252]</sup></a> and both lovers
cried, “We were in the Garden of Paradise together with the Húr
and Ghilmán:<a id="r253"></a><a href="#f253" class="c011"><sup>[253]</sup></a> Allah requite thee for us with all weal.” Then
they passed into the Hammam and when they had bathed, the
youth said, “O my lord, what shall we do with the young lady
and how shall she hie to her household and what shall be the case
of me without her?” “Feel no grief,” said the other, “and quit
all care of anything: e’en as she came so shall she go; nor shall
any of Almighty Allah’s creatures know aught of her.” Hereat
the Sage dismissed her by the means which conveyed her, nor did
she cease to bear her bedding with her every night and to visit
the youth with all joyance and delight. Now after a few weeks had
gone by, this young lady happening to be upon the terrace-roof of
her palace in company with her mother, turned her back to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_129">129</span>sun, and when the heat struck her between the shoulders her belly
swelled; so her parent asked her, “O my daughter, what hast thou
that thou juttest out after this wise?” “I wot naught thereof,”
answered she; so the mother put forth her hand to the belly
of her child and found her pregnant; whereupon she screamed and
buffeted her face and asked, “Whence did this befal thee?” The
women-attendants all heard her cries and running up to her
enquired, “What hath caused thee, O our lady, such case as this?”
whereto she replied, “I would bespeak the Caliph.” So the
women sought him and said, “O our lord, thou art wanted by our
lady;” and he did their bidding and went to his wife, but at first
sight he noted the condition of his daughter and asked her, “What
is to do with thee and what hath brought on thee such calamity?”
Hereupon the Princess told him how it was with her and he
exclaimed as he heard it, “O my daughter, I am the Caliph and
Commander of the Faithful, and thou hast been sought to wife of
me by the Kings of the earth one and all, but thou didst not accept
them as connections and now thou doest such deed as this! I
swear the most binding of oaths and I vow by the tombs of my
sires and my grandsires, an thou say me sooth thou shalt be saved;
but unless thou tell me truth concerning whatso befel thee and
from whom came this affair and the quality of the man’s intention
theewards, I will slaughter thee and under earth I will sepulchre
thee.” Now when the Princess heard from her father’s mouth
these words and had pondered this swear he had sworn she
replied, “O my sire, albeit lying may save yet is truth-telling the
more saving side. Verily, O my father, ’tis some time before this
day that my bed beareth me up every night and carrieth me to a
house of the houses wherein dwelleth a youth, a model of beauty
and loveliness, who causeth every seer to languish; and he beddeth
with me and sleepeth by my side until dawn, when my couch
uplifteth me and returneth with me to the Palace: nor wot I the
manner of my going and the mode of my coming is alike unknown
<span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>to me.” The Caliph hearing these her words marvelled at this her
tale with exceeding marvel and fell into the uttermost of wonderment,
but bethinking him of his Wazir, a man of penetrative wit,
sagacious, astute, argute exceedingly, he summoned him to the
presence and acquainted him as soon as he came with this affair
and what had befallen his daughter; to wit, how she was borne
away in her bed without knowing whither or aught else. Quoth
the Minister after taking thought for a full-told hour, “O Caliph of
the Time and the Age, I have a device by whose virtue I do opine
we shall arrive at the stead whither wendeth the Princess;” and
quoth the Caliph, “What may be this device of thine?” “Bid
bring me a bag;” rejoined the Wazir, “which I will let fill with
millet;”<a id="r254"></a><a href="#f254" class="c011"><sup>[254]</sup></a> so they brought him one and he after stuffing the same
with grain set it upon the girl’s bed and close to her where lay her
head, leaving the mouth open to the intent that when during the
coming night her couch might be carried away, the millet in going
and returning might be shed upon the path. “Allah bless thee,
Ho thou the Wazir!” cried the Caliph: “this device of thine is
passing good and fair fall it for a sleight than which naught can be
slyer and good luck to it for a proof than which naught can be
better proven.” Now as soon as it was even-tide, the couch was
carried off as had happened every night and the grain was strown
broadcast upon the path, like a stream, from the gateway of the
Palace to the door of the young Cook’s lodging, wherein the
Princess nighted as was her wont until dawn of day. And when
morn appeared the Sage came and carried off with him the youth
to the Hammam where he found privacy and said to him, “O my
son, an thou ask me aught touching thy mistress’s kith and kin, I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>bid thee know that they have indeed discovered her condition and
against thee they have devised a device.” Exclaimed the youth,
“Verily we are Allah’s and unto Him are we returning! What
may be thy rede in this affair? An they slay me I shall be a
martyr on Allah’s path;<a id="r255"></a><a href="#f255" class="c011"><sup>[255]</sup></a> but do thou wend thy ways and save
thyself and may the Almighty requite thee with all of welfare;
thee, through whom mine every wish I have won, and the whole
of my designs I have fulfilled; after which let them do with me as
they desire.” The Warlock replied, “O my son, grieve not neither
fear, for naught shall befal thee of harm, and I purpose to show
thee marvels and miracles wroughten upon them.” When the
youth heard these words his spirits were cheered, and joying with
joy exceeding he replied, “Almighty Allah reward thee for me
with fullest welfare!” Then the twain went forth the Hammam
and hied them home. But as soon as morning morrowed, the
Wazir repaired to the Caliph; and, both going to the Princess
together, found her in her bower and the bag upon her bed clean
empty of millet, at sight of which the Minister exclaimed, “Now
indeed we have caught our debtor. Up with us and to horse, O
Caliph of the Age, and sum and substance of the Time and the
Tide, and follow we the millet and track its trail.” The Commander
of the Faithful forthright gave orders to mount, and the
twain, escorted by their host, rode forth on the traces of the grain
till they drew near the house, when the youth heard the jingle and
jangle<a id="r256"></a><a href="#f256" class="c011"><sup>[256]</sup></a> of horses’ tramp and the wrangle and cangle of men’s outcries.
Upon this said the Cook to the Warlock, “Here they draw
near to seize me, O my lord, what is there now for me to do?” and
said the other, “Rise and fill me an ewer with water; then mount
therewith to the terrace-roof and pour the contents round and
about the house, after which come down to me.” The youth did
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>his bidding, and meanwhile the Caliph and the Wazir and the
soldiery had approached the house when, lo and behold! the
site had become an island amiddlemost a main dashing with
clashing billows.<a id="r257"></a><a href="#f257" class="c011"><sup>[257]</sup></a> But when the Commander of the Faithful
sighted this sea, he was perplexed with mighty great perplexity
and enquired of the Wazir, “At what time did such great water
appear in this place?” The Minister replied, “I never knew that
here was any stream, albe well I wot that the Tigris river floweth
amiddlemost the capital; but this is a magical current.” So saying
he bade the soldiery urge their horses into the water sans fear,
and every one drave as he had directed until all who entered lost
their lives and a many of men where drowned. Hereupon cried
the Prince of True Believers, “O Wazir, we are about to destroy
our host and to fare with them!” and cried the other, “How shall
we act, O Caliph of the Age? Haply our first, nay our best way,
is to ask help of those within the house and grant to them
indemnity while they exchange words with us and we see anon
what will come of their affair.” “Do as beseemeth thee,” answered
the Prince of True Believers; whereupon the Minister commanded
his men to cry aloud upon the household and they sued
for help during a length of time. But the Sage, hearing their
shouts, said to the youth, “Arise and go up to the terrace and say
to the Caliph of the Age:—Thou art in safety; turn away thy
steps hence and presently we will meet thy Highness in health and
weal; otherwise<a id="r258"></a><a href="#f258" class="c011"><sup>[258]</sup></a> thy daughter shall be lost and thine army shall
be destroyed, and thou, O Commander of the Faithful, wilt depart
and return as one outdriven. Do thou wend thy ways: this be
not the mode of meeting us and in such manner there is no
<span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>management.” The Cook did as he was bidden, and when the
twain heard his words, quoth the Wazir to the Caliph, “Verily
these be naught save Magicians, otherwise they must be of the
fulsomest of the Jann, for indeed never heard we nor saw we aught
of this.” Hereupon the Prince of True Believers turned his back
upon the place and he sorrowful and strait of breast and disheartened
of heart; so he went down to his Palace and sat there
for a full-told hour when behold, the Warlock and the Cook
appeared before him. But as soon as they stood in the presence
the Caliph cried out, “O Linkman, bring me the head of yonder
youth from between his shoulders!” Hereupon the Executioner
came forward and tearing a strip off the youth’s robe-skirt
bandaged his eyes; then he walked thrice round about him
brandishing his blade over the victim’s head and lastly cried,
“O Caliph of the Age, shall I make away with this youth?”
Answered the Caliph, “Yes, after thou shalt have stricken off his
head.” Hearing this the Sworder raised his hand and smote,
when suddenly his grip was turned backwards upon a familiar
of his who stood beside him, and it lighted upon his neck
with such force that his head flew off and fell at the Caliph’s
feet. The King and the Wazir were perplexed at this affair,
and the former cried out, “What be this? Art gone blind, O
Bhang-eater, that thy stroke hath missed the mark and thou
hast not known thy familiar from this youth who kneeleth before
thee? Smite him without delay!” Hereupon the Linkman again
raised his hand to obey his lord, but the blow fell upon the neck
of his varlet and the head flew off and rolled at the feet of the
Caliph and his Chief Councillor. At this second mishap the wits of
all present were bewildered and the King cried, “What business
is this, O Wazir?” whereto the other made answer, “O Caliph of
the Time and rare gift of the Age and the Tide, what canst thou
do, O my lord, with such as these? And whoso availeth to take
away o’ nights thy daughter upon her bed and dispread a sea
<span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>around his house, the same also hath power to tear thy kingdom
from thy grasp; nay more, to practise upon thy life. Now ’tis my
rede that thou rise and kiss the hand of this Sage and sue his protection,<a id="r259"></a><a href="#f259" class="c011"><sup>[259]</sup></a>
lest he work upon us worse than this. Believe me, ’twere
better for thee, O my lord, to do as I bid thee and thus ’twill be
well for us rather than to rise up as adversaries of this man.”
Hearing such words from his Minister, the King bade them raise
the youth from the strip of blood-rug and remove the bandage
from before his eyes, after which he rose to his feet, and, kissing
the Warlock’s hand, said to him, “In very sooth we knew
thee not nor were we ware of the measure of thine excellence.
But, O teacher of the Time and sum and substance of revolving
Tide, why hast thou wrought to me on this wise in the matter
of my daughter and destroyed my servants and soldiers?” “O
Viceregent of Allah upon His Earth,” replied the Sage, “I am a
stranger, and having eaten bread and salt with this youth, I formed
friendship and familiarity with him: then, seeing his case which
was sad and his state which was marvellous as it had afflicted him
with sickness, I took compassion upon him; moreover I designed
to show you all what I am and what Almighty Allah hath taught
me of occult knowledge. Hitherto there hath been naught save
weal, and now I desire of thy favour that thou marry thy daughter
to this youth, my familiar, for that she suiteth none other save
himself.” Quoth the Caliph, “This proceeding I look upon as the
fittest and it besitteth us that we obey thy bidding.” Presently
he robed the youth with a sumptuous robe worth the kingdom of a
King, and commanded him to sit beside the presence and seated
the Sage upon a chair of ebony-wood. Now whilst they were in
converse the Warlock turned round and beheld arear of the Caliph
a hanging of sendal whereupon stood figured lions twain: so he
signed with his hand to these forms which were mighty huge of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>limb and awesome to look upon, when each put forth his paw upon
his fellow and both roared with roars like unto the bellow of ear-rending
thunder. Hereat all present were perplext in the extreme
and were in admiration at that matter, and especially the Prince
of True Believers who cried, “O Wazir, what seest thou in this
business?” The Wazir replied, “O Caliph of the Age, verily
Allah Almighty to thee hath sent this Sage that He<a id="r260"></a><a href="#f260" class="c011"><sup>[260]</sup></a> might
show thee such marvels as these.” Then the Warlock signalled
with his hand to the lions which shrank till they became as
cats which carried on the combat; and both Caliph and Wazir
wondered thereat with excessive wonderment. Anon quoth the
King to the Minister, “Bid the Sage display to us more of his
marvels;” and accordingly the Wazir obeyed his lord’s behest, and
the Warlock replied, “To hear is to obey.” He then said, “Bring
hither to me a chauldron full of water;” and when it was brought
he asked the Courtiers, “Which of you would divert himself?”
“I,” quoth the Wazir; when quoth the Sage, “Do thou rise to
thy feet and doff thy robes and gird thee with a zone:” whereto
said the other, “Bring me a waistcloth;” and when it was brought
he did therewith as he was bidden. Hereat said the Warlock,
“Seat thee in the centre of the chauldron;” so he plunged into
the water, but when he would have seated him amiddlemost thereof
as ordered he saw only that he had entered a sea dashing with
surges clashing wherein whoso goeth is lost to view, and whence
whoso cometh is born anew; and he fell to swimming from side to
side intending to issue forth, while the waves suffered him not to
make the shore. And while he was in this case behold, a billow
of the billows vomited<a id="r261"></a><a href="#f261" class="c011"><sup>[261]</sup></a> him up from the sea to the strand and he
stood on dry land, when he surveyed his person and suddenly saw
that he had become a woman with the breasts of a woman and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_136">136</span>solution of continuity like a woman, and long black hair flowing
down to his heels even as a woman’s. Then said he to himself,
“O ill-omened diversion! What have I done with such unlucky
disport that I have looked upon this marvel and wonder of wonderments,
only to become a woman.<a id="r262"></a><a href="#f262" class="c011"><sup>[262]</sup></a> Verily we are Allah’s, and unto
Him shall we return;” adding as he took thought of the matter
and of what had befallen him, “There is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.” Presently a
Fisherman approached him and sighting a fair girl said, “This
be none other than a blessed day which Allah hath opened to us
with a beautiful maiden for quarry; and she is doubtless of the
Daughters of the Deep, whom Allah Almighty hath sent to us
that I may espouse her to my son.” Hearing these words said
the transformed to himself, “Now after being a Wazir I have
become a woman and this be for that as tit for tat,<a id="r263"></a><a href="#f263" class="c011"><sup>[263]</sup></a> and the wight
furthermore desireth to see me married, and as for the Caliph and
the kingdom and the countries, who shall now be able to offer
them counsel?” But the Fisherman who for his joyance had no
stomach to ply his pursuit, as was his custom, forthwith arose and
taking with him the Daughter of the Deep led her to his house,
and on entering the door cried aloud to his wife, “This day hath
been a lucky for my fishing craft: during all these years it never
befel me to happen upon a Mermaid save on this best-omened of
all the days,” adding, “Where is thy son, to whom Allah hath sent
this Daughter of the Daughters of the Main; and hath made her
his portion and vouchsafed her to his service? for ’tis my design
to marry them.” Replied the woman, “He hath taken the beast<a id="r264"></a><a href="#f264" class="c011"><sup>[264]</sup></a>
and hath fared forth to pasture it and plough therewith; but right
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>soon will he return.” And whilst they were thus conversing the
youth came forward, and the Wazir on sighting him groaned and
cried, “Well-away for me! this very night I shall become a bride
for this blamed lad<a id="r265"></a><a href="#f265" class="c011"><sup>[265]</sup></a> to sleep withal. And if I say to them:—What
intent have ye? Ye are in meanness and misery<a id="r266"></a><a href="#f266" class="c011"><sup>[266]</sup></a> while I am
Wazir to the Caliph; they will never believe me for that I have
become a woman, and all thereto appertaining now belongeth to
me. Alack and alas for that I did with mine own self; indeed
what business had I with such diversion?” Hereupon the fisherman
called out, “O my son, up with thee and straightway take
this Mermaid and marry her and abate her pucelage and be blessed
with her and enjoy thy joy with her during all the days of thy life-tide:
doubtless, O my child, thou art in all boon fortune, seeing
that what good befel thee never betided any before thee nor will
become the lot of one after thee.” So the youth arose and for his
delight hardly believing in his conquest, married her and lay with
her and did away her maidenhead and on that very night she conceived
by him. After nine months she bare him issue and the
couple ceased not to be after this fashion till she had become a
mother of seven. But the Wazir, of his stress and excess of the
trouble and the travail he endured, said to himself, “How long shall
last this toil and torment wherewith I am liver-smitten and that
too by mine own consent? So e’en will I arise and hie me to this
sea and hurl me thereinto and whatso shall become of me let it
be: haply I may find rest from these torments into which I have
fallen.” And forthright he arose and sought the shore and did as
he had devised, when a wave enveloped him and cast him deep
into the depths and he was like to choke, when suddenly his head
protruded from the chauldron and he was seated as before he had
ducked it. Hereupon he saw the Caliph sitting in state with the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_138">138</span>Sage by his side and all the Lords of the land and the Notables of
the commons awaiting the end of his adventure. So he gazed at
them and showed a smiling face<a id="r267"></a><a href="#f267" class="c011"><sup>[267]</sup></a> and laughed aloud when the
Prince of True Believers asked him saying, “What hast thou seen,
O Wazir?” So he repeated to the Sovran all he had sighted and
everything that had come down upon his head, presently adding,
“O Caliph of the Age and the sum and substance of the Time and
the Tide, what be these marvels wrought by this Sage? Verily I
have beheld the garths of Paradise<a id="r268"></a><a href="#f268" class="c011"><sup>[268]</sup></a> with maidens of the Húr and
the youths of Heaven, and wonderments galore unlooked upon by
mankind at all, at all. But, an thou be pleased, O Commander of
the Faithful, to espy these rare spectacles and marvellous conditions
with thine own eyes, deign go down into the water; so shalt thou
divert thyself with peregrine matters and adventures seld-seen.”
The Sultan, delighted at this rede, arose and doffed his dress;
then, girding his loins with a zone, he entered the chauldron
whereat the Sage cried out to him, “O my lord, sit thee down and
duck thy head.” But when this was done the Caliph found himself
in a bottomless sea and wide-dispread and never at rest by any
manner of means, so he fell to swimming therein, when a huge
breaker threw him high ashore and he walked up the beach
mother-naked save for his zone. So he said in his mind, “Let me
see what hath been wrought with me by the Sage and the Wazir
who have thus practised upon me and have cast me in this place;
and haply they have married my daughter to the youth, and they
have stolen my kingdom, the Sage becoming Sultan in my stead.
And now let me ask myself, What had I to do with such damned
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>diversion as this?” But as he brooded over these thoughts and
the like of them behold, a bevy of maidens came forwards to fill
their pitchers from a fountain and a pool of sweet water lying
beside the sea; and sighting him they exclaimed, “Thou, who art
thou? say sooth be thou of mankind or rather haply of Jinn-kind?”
He replied, “I am a mortal and of the noblest-born;
withal I am a stranger in the land and I wot not whither I should
wend.” “Of what country art thou?” asked they, and he
answered, “I am from Baghdad.” “Up with thee,” quoth one of
the damsels, “to yonder knoll, then down to the flat on the further
side, and thou shalt sight a city whose name is ’Omán,<a id="r269"></a><a href="#f269" class="c011"><sup>[269]</sup></a> whereinto
do thou enter.” The Caliph did her bidding, and no sooner
had the people seen him stripped than they said one to other,
“This man is a merchant who hath been shipwrecked;” so they
gave him by way of alms-gift a Tobe<a id="r270"></a><a href="#f270" class="c011"><sup>[270]</sup></a> all tattered and torn wherewith
he veiled his shame. And after so doing he fell to wandering
about the city for pastime, and while walking about he passed into
a Bazar and there sighted a cook, before whom he stood open-mouthed
(for indeed famine had thinned him), and he bethought
him of what to do, and he knew not how to act. However the
cook at first sight was certified of his being a foreigner, and haply
a shipwrecked mariner so he asked him, “O my brother, why dost
thou not come in and sit thee down, for thou art a stranger and
without means; so in the way of Allah I would engage thy services
and will pay thee daily two dirhams to provide thee with meat
and drink.” Answered the Caliph, “Hearing and obeying,” after
which he abode with the cook and served him and stinted not
to serve him for a long time, saying in himself the while, “This
for that is tit for tat! and after the Caliphate and commandment
and happiness and honour, this day art thou left to lick the platters.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>What had I to do with such diversion as this? Withal ’tis fairer
than the spectacle that anyone even my Wazir ever saw and the
more excellent, for that I after being the Caliph of the Age, and
the choice gift of the Time and Tide have now become the hireling
of a cook. Would to Heaven I wot the sin which brought
me hereto?”<a id="r271"></a><a href="#f271" class="c011"><sup>[271]</sup></a> Now as he abode with the cook it befel him that
one day he threaded the Jewellers’ Bazar; for about that city
was a sea-site whereinto the duckers and divers went down and
whence they brought up pearls and corals and precious stones;
and as he stood in the market-place, quoth he to himself, “Let me
here become a broker in this market-street and find rest from
my groaning in labour and my licking of platters.” As soon as
morning morrowed he did on such wise, when suddenly a merchant
approached him, hending in hand a costly gem whose light
burned like a lamp or rather like a ray of sunshine, and ’twas
worth the tribute of Egypt and Syria. Hereat the Caliph marvelled
with exceeding marvel, and quoth he to the trader, “Say
me, wilt thou sell this jewel?” and quoth the other, “Yes.” So
the Sultan taking it from him went about with it amongst the
merchants, who seeing and considering it, wondered greatly at its
beauty. Accordingly they bid for it fifty thousand dinars, but
the royal broker ceased not to bear it about and the buyers
to increase their biddings till they offered an hundred thousand
gold pieces. Thereupon the Caliph returned with it to the owner
and accosted him saying, “Wilt thou sell it for the sum named?”
and when the merchant consented, he continued, “I now go to
receive its price, wherewith I will come back to thee.” Then the
broker went up to the buyer and said, “Bring hither its value and
set it in my hand;” but the man asked him, “Where be its
owner?” and the Caliph answered, “Its owner hath commissioned
<span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>me to receive its price, after which he will come and recover the
same from me.” However the bidder retorted, “This be not
fitting nor is it according to Holy Law: do thou bring me its
owner; then come and let him pouch the price, for ’tis he hath
sold it to me and thou art only our agent.” Hereupon the Caliph
went forth to seek the proprietor and wandered about a long
while without finding him; after which he again accosted the
purchaser, and said to him, “I am the rightful proprietor: place
the price in my hand.” The buyer arose to pay his debt, but
before so doing he considered the jewel and saw that it was a bit
of dark Sandarach;<a id="r272"></a><a href="#f272" class="c011"><sup>[272]</sup></a> whereat he was sore perplext and cried out
to the Caliph, “O Satan, dost thou palm off false wares, the
market-place of the merchants being under the orders of the
Sultan?” But when the traders heard these words, they flocked
around the pretended broker and having seized him they pinioned
his elbows and dragged him before the Sovran of that city who,
when they set the prisoner before him, asked, “What be the
offence of this man?” “O our honoured lord,” answered they,
“this wight palmeth off false wares and swindleth the traders in
the royal Bazar.” So the King commanded them to hang him,
whereat they charged his neck with chains and bared his head,
and bade the cryer cry, “This be his award and the least of
awards who forgeth counterfeits and who tricketh the merchant-folk
in the market-place of the Sultan.” Hereat quoth the Caliph
to himself, “I was not content with platter-licking, which now
appeareth to me a mighty pleasant calling but e’en I must become
a broker and die <em>sus. per coll</em>. This be for that tit for tat; however,
scant blame to the Time which hath charged me with this
work.” Now when they brought him to the hanging-place and
threw the loop around his neck and fell to hoisting him up, as he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>rose from the ground his eyes were opened and he found himself
emerging from the chauldron, whilst the Wazir and the Sage and
the youth were sitting and considering him. And the Minister
catching sight of his lord sprang to his feet and kissed ground
before him, and laughed aloud, and the Commander of the Faithful
asked him, “Why this laughter?” Answered he, “O thou, the
Prince of True Believers and God-guarded Sovran, my laughter
and my gladness are for myself, seeing that I have recovered my
identity after becoming a woman and being wedded to a ploughman,
who eared the ground, and after bearing to him seven babes.”
Cried the Caliph, “Woe to thee, O dog, O son of a dog, thou
wast married and rejoicedst in children, whereas I this very
moment from the hanging-place have come down.” Then he
informed the Wazir of all that had befallen him and the Minister
did on like guise, whereat all those present laughed consumedly
and marvelled at the words of the Warlock, and his proficiency
in occult knowledge. Then the Kazi and witnesses were summoned
with their writing-gear and were bidden draw up the
marriage-contract of the young Cook and the Caliph’s daughter.
After this the Sage sojourned with the Commander of the
Faithful in highmost degree and most honourable dignity, and
they abode eating and drinking and living the most delectable of
lives and the most enjoyable with all manner of joy and jollity,
till came to them the Destroyer of delights
and the Divider of man’s days
and they departed life
one and all.</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE PLEASANT HISTORY OF THE COCK AND THE FOX.</h2>
</div>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span><b>Here we begin to indite the pleasant History which befel between the Cock and the Fox.</b><a id="r273"></a><a href="#f273" class="c011"><sup>[273]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">It is said that there abode in such a village a man which was a
Shaykh of long standing, one gifted with fair rede and right
understanding. Now he had on his farm a plenty of poultry, male
and female, and these he was wont to breed and to eat of their
eggs and their chickens. But amongst his cocks was a Chanticleer,
well advanced of age and wily of wit, who had long fought
with Fortune and who had become wise and ware in worldly
matters and in the turns and shifts of Time. It fortuned one day
that this Cock went forth to wander about the farm-lands pecking
and picking up as he went such grains of wheat and barley and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>holcus<a id="r274"></a><a href="#f274" class="c011"><sup>[274]</sup></a> and sesame and millet as chanced fall in his way; but,
being careless of himself, he had left the village afar off without
thinking of what he did, and ere he took counsel with himself he
found him amiddlemost the wilderness. So he turned him rightwards
and leftwards but espied nor friend nor familiar, whereat he
stood perplext as to his affair and his breast was straitened and
still he knew not what to do. Now while thus bewildered in his
wits touching his next step, behold, his glance fell upon a Fox<a id="r275"></a><a href="#f275" class="c011"><sup>[275]</sup></a>
who was approaching him from afar, whereat he feared and
trembled and was agitated with mighty great agitation. At once
he turned him about and presently espied a high wall arising from
the waste, whereto was no place of ascending for his foe; so he
spread his wings and flew up and perched upon the coping where
he took his station. Presently the Fox came forward to the foot
of the wall, and, finding no means of climbing it and getting at
the fowl, he raised his head and said, “The Peace be upon thee,
ho thou the soothfast brother and suitable friend!” But as the
Cock would not turn towards him nor return aught of reply to his
salutation, the Fox resumed, “What is to do with thee, O dear my
brother, that my greeting thou acknowledgest not and to my
words inclinest thee not?” Still the Cock requited not his
courtesy and declined to reply, whereat the Fox resumed,
“Wottest thou not, O my brother, the glad tidings wherewith
I came theewards, with what suitable intelligence and counsel
veridical and information at once sincere and self-evident? and,
didst know what it is hath come to mine ears, verily thou
hadst embraced me and kissed me on the mouth.” But the Cock
feigned absence of mind and ignored him and answered him
naught, but stood with rounded eyes and fixed upon the
far when the Fox resumed, “O my brother, the King of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>Beasts which be the Lion and the King of the Birds which be
the Eagle have alighted from a journey upon the meads where
grass is a-growing and by the marge where waters are a-flowing
and blossoms are a-blowing and browsing gazelles are a-to-ing and
a-fro-ing; and the twain have gathered together all manner of
ferals, lions and hyenas, leopards and lynxes, wild cattle and
antelopes and jackals and even hares, brief, all the wild beasts of
the world; and they have also collected every kind of bird, eagle
and vulture, crow and raven,<a id="r276"></a><a href="#f276" class="c011"><sup>[276]</sup></a> wild pigeon and turtle-dove, poultry
and fowls and Katás and quails<a id="r277"></a><a href="#f277" class="c011"><sup>[277]</sup></a> and other small deer, and these
two liege lords have bidden the herald proclaim, throughout the
tracts of the upland wold and the wild lowland, safety and security
and confraternity and peace with honour and sympathy and
familiar friendship and affection and love amongst wild beasts
and cattle and birds; also that enmity be done away with and
wrongs be forbidden nor might one transgress against other; nay,
if any chance to injure his fellow this offence might be for his
scourging a reason, and for his death by tearing to pieces a justification.
The order hath also come forth that all do feed and
browse in one place whichever they please, never venturing to
break the peace but dwelling in all amity and affection and
intimacy one with other. Moreover they have commissioned me,
very me, to overroam the wastes and gladden with good tidings
the peoples of the wilds and proclaim that one and all without
exception must assemble together, and also that whoso delayeth
or refuseth obedience shall not escape punishment<a id="r278"></a><a href="#f278" class="c011"><sup>[278]</sup></a> nor let each
and every fail to make act of presence and to kiss hands. And of
thee, O my brother, I especially require that thou descend from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>thy high stead in safety and security and satisfaction, and that
henceforward thy heart be not startled nor thy limbs shake for
fear.” All this description was described by the Fox to the Cock
who paid no heed to him as though he had never heard the news;
and he remained silent without return of reply or without so much
as turning to regard him; nay, he only kept his head raised and
gazed afar. Hereat quoth to him the Fox (for indeed his heart
burned with desire to know how he could seize and devour him),
“O brother mine, why and wherefore dost thou not acknowledge
me by an answer or address to me a word or even turn thy face
towards me who am a Commissioner sent by Leo, Sovran of the
beasts, and Aquila, Sultan of the birds? Sore I fear lest thou
refuse to accompany me and thus come upon thee censure
exceeding and odium excessive seeing that all are assembled in
the presence and are browsing upon the verdant mead.” Then
he added (as Chanticleer regarded him not), “O my brother, I
bespeak thee and thou unheedest me and my speech; and, if thou
refuse to fare with me, at least let me know what may be thy
reply.” Hereupon the Cock inclined towards him and said,
“Sooth hast thou spoken, O my brother, and well I wot thou be
an Envoy and a Commissioner from our King, and the special
Messenger of him: but my condition is changed by that which
hath befallen me.” “And what calamity, O my brother, hath
betided thee?” “Dost thou espy what I am at present espying?”
“And what is it thou espiest?” “Verily, I see a dust-cloud
lowering and the Saker-falcons in circles towering;” and quoth
the Fox (whose heart throbbed with fear), “Look straitly, O my
brother, lest there happen to us a mishap.” So Chanticleer gazed
as one distraught for a full-told hour, after which he turned to the
Fox and said, “O my brother, I behold and can distinguish a bird
flying and a dust-trail hieing.” “Consider them narrowly, O my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>brother,” cried the Fox (whose side-muscles quivered), “lest this
be sign of greyhound;” and the other replied, “The Truth is
known to Allah alone, yet I seem now to see a something lengthy
of leg, lean of flank, loose of ears, fine of forehand and full of
quarter, and at this moment it draweth near and is well nigh upon
us—O fine!”<a id="r279"></a><a href="#f279" class="c011"><sup>[279]</sup></a> Now when the Fox heard these words he cried to
the Cock, “O my brother, I must farewell thee!” and so saying
he arose and committed his legs to the wind and he had recourse
to the Father of Safety.<a id="r280"></a><a href="#f280" class="c011"><sup>[280]</sup></a> Seeing this, the Cock also cried, “Why
thus take to flight when thou hast no spoiler thy heart to affright?”
Replied the Fox, “I have a fear of the Greyhound, O my brother,
for that he is not of my friends or of my familiars;” and the Cock
rejoined, “Didst thou not tell me thou camest as Commissioner of
the Kings to these wastes proclaiming a peace and safety amongst
all the beasts and the birds?” “O my brother Chanticleer,”
retorted the other, “this feral, Greyhound hight, was not present
at the time when pacification was proclaimed, nor was his name
announced in the Congress of the beasts; and I for my part have
no love lost with him, nor between me and him is there aught of
security.” So saying the Fox turned forthright to fly, routed with
the foulest of routing, and the Cock escaped the foe by his sleight
and sagacity with perfect safety and security. Now after the Fox
had turned tail and fled from him Chanticleer came down from the
wall and regained his farm, lauding Allah Almighty who had conveyed
him unharmed to his own place. And here he related unto
  his fellows what had befallen him with the Fox
    and how he had devised that cunning device
      and thereby freed himself from a
        strait wherein, but for it,
          the foe had torn him
            limb by limb.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span><b>Here we begin to indite the History of what befel the Fowl-let from the Fowler.</b><a id="r281"></a><a href="#f281" class="c011"><sup>[281]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">They relate (but Allah is All-knowing) that there abode in
Baghdad-city a huntsman-wight in venerie trained aright. Now
one day he went forth to the chase taking with him nets and
springes and other gear he needed and fared to a garden-site with
trees bedight and branches interlaced tight wherein all the fowls
did unite; and arriving at a tangled copse he planted his trap in
the ground and he looked around for a hiding-place and took seat
therein concealed. Suddenly a Birdie approaching the trap-side
began scraping the earth and, wandering round about it, fell to
saying in himself, “What may this be? Would Heaven I wot,
for it seemeth naught save a marvellous creation of Allah!”
Presently he considered the decoy which was half buried in the
ground and salam’d to it from afar to the far and the Trap
returned his salutation, adding thereto, “And the ruth of Allah
and His blessings;” and presently pursued, “Welcome and fair
welcome to the brother dear and the friend sincere and the companionable
fere and the kindly compeer, why stand from me so
far when I desire thou become my neighbour near and I become
of thine intimates the faithful and of thy comrades the truthful?
So draw thee nigh to me and be of thy safety trustful and prove
thee not of me fearful.” Quoth the Fowl-let, “I beseech thee by
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>Allah, say me who art thou so I may not of thee feel affright and
what be thy bye-name and thy name and to which of the tribes
dost trace thy tree?” And quoth the Trap, “My name is Holdfast<a id="r282"></a><a href="#f282" class="c011"><sup>[282]</sup></a>
and my patronymic is Bindfast and my tribe is hight
the Sons of Fallfast.” Replied the Birdie, “Sooth thou sayest;
for such name is truly thy name and such bye-name is without
question thy bye-name nor is there any doubt of thy tribe being
the noblest of the tribes.” The Trap answered him saying,
“Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord—that me thou hast recognised
and that I be of thy truest friends thou hast acknowledged, for
where shalt thou find a familiar like unto me, a lover soothful and
truthful and my fellow in mind? And indeed I  a devotee of
religious bent and from vain gossip and acquaintances and even
kith and kin abstinent; nor have I any retreat save upon the
heads of hills and in the bellies of dales which be long and deep;
and from mundane tidings I am the true Holdfast and in worldly
joys the real Bindfast.” The Fowl replied, “Sooth hast spoken,
O my lord; and all hail to thee; how pious and religious and of
morals and manners gracious art thou? Would to Heaven I
were a single hair upon thy body.” Rejoined the Trap, “Thou
in this world art my brother and in the next world my father;”
and the other retorted, “O my brother, fain would I question thee
concerning matters concealed within thy thoughts;” whereto the
Trap, “Enquire of whatso thou requirest, that I make manifest to
thee what in heart thou desirest; for I will truly declare to thee
mine every aim and disclose to thee soothly all my case and my
thoughts concealed, nor shall remain unrevealed of mine intent
aught.” So the Birdie began, “O my brother, why and wherefore
see I thee on this wise abiding in the dust and dwelling afar from
relations and companeers and thou hast parted from thy family
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>and peers and hast departed from the fondness of thy dears?”
“Hast thou not learned, O my brother,” answered the Trap, “that
retirement is permanent heal and farness from folk doth blessings
deal and separation from the world is bodily weal;” and on this
matter hath one of the poets said, and said right well:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Fly folk, in public ne’er appearing, ✿ And men shall name thee man God-fearing;<a id="r283"></a><a href="#f283" class="c011"><sup>[283]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">Nor say I’ve brother, mate and friend: ✿ Try men with mind still persevering:</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, few are they as thou couldst wish: ✿ Scorpions they prove when most endearing.<a id="r284"></a><a href="#f284" class="c011"><sup>[284]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And one of the Sages hath said, “Solitude and not ill associate.”
Also quoth they to Al-Bahlúl,<a id="r285"></a><a href="#f285" class="c011"><sup>[285]</sup></a> Why this tarrying of thine amid
the homes of the dead and why this sojourning in a barren stead
and wherefore this farness from kinsmen and mate and lack of
neighbourly love for brother and intimate? But quoth he, “Woe
to you! my folk did I dwell amongst them would some day unlove
me and the while I abide far from them will never reprove me; nor
indeed would they remember my affection nor would they desire my
predilection; and so satisfied with my solitude am I that an I saw
my family I should start away as in fear of them, and were my
parents quickened anew and longed for my society verily I would
take flight from them.” Replied the Fowl-let, “In good sooth,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>O my brother, truth thou hast pronounced in all by thee announced
and the best of rede did from thee proceed; but tell me, prithee,
anent that cord about thy middle wound and despite thine expending
efforts that abound why thou art neither a-standing nor
a-sitting on ground?” To him replied the Trap, “O my brother,
learn that I spend every night of every month in prayer, during
which exercise whenever sleep would seize me I tighten this cord
about my waist and drive slumber from my eyes and become
therefrom the more wide-awake for my orisons. Know thou also
that Allah (be He glorified and magnified!) affectioneth his servants
when devout are they, and stand in worship alway, ever
dight to pray and praise Him by night and by day; and who turn
on their sides loving the Lord to obey in desire and dismay and
doling their good away. And quoth Allah (be He glorified and
magnified!):—‘And for scanty while of the night they take not
gentle rest and at rising morn His pardon they obtest and their
Lord granteth unto them their request.’<a id="r286"></a><a href="#f286" class="c011"><sup>[286]</sup></a> And wottest thou not,
O my brother, what said the poet?—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">These busy are with worldly gear ✿ Those of their moneys proud appear:</div>
      <div class="line">But some be rich by God’s approof— ✿ Praise Him o’ nights with love sincere:</div>
      <div class="line">Their Guardian’s eye regards them aye ✿ Praying, confessing sins to clear:</div>
      <div class="line">They wot nor worship aught but Him ✿ And hail His name with love and fear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Therewith quoth the Fowl-let: “Sooth hast thou said, O my
brother, in each word by thee sped and right eloquently was
announced all by thee pronounced; however (I am thy protected!),
do thou tell me why I see thee one half buried in earth
and the other half above ground?” And quoth the Trap, “For
the reason that I thereby resemble the dead and in life I am
shunning the pernicious lusts of the flesh; and Almighty Allah
(be He glorified and magnified!) said in His August Volume:—‘From
<span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>earth have We created you and unto her We will return
you and from her will We draw you forth a second time.’”<a id="r287"></a><a href="#f287" class="c011"><sup>[287]</sup></a>
Replied the Birdie, “The truth thou hast told in whatso thou
dost unfold, but why do I see thee so bent of back?” and rejoined
the Trap, “Learn, O my brother, that the cause for this bowing
of my back is my frequent standing in prayer by day and my
upstanding by night in the service of the King, the Clement, the
One, the Prepotent, the Glorious, the Omnipotent; and verily
upon this matter right well the poet hath spoken:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">None save the pious Youth gains boon of Paradise ✿ (To whom the Lord doth pardon crime and sin and vice),</div>
      <div class="line">Whose back by constant prayer through murk o’ night is bent ✿ And longs to merit Heaven in sore and painful guise.</div>
      <div class="line">Hail to the slave who ever would his lord obey ✿ And who by death is saved when he obedient dies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Fowl-let continued, “O my brother, of truth the token is that
whereof thou hast spoken and I have understood thee and am
certified of thy sooth. But yet, I see upon thee a robe<a id="r288"></a><a href="#f288" class="c011"><sup>[288]</sup></a> of hair!”
and the Trap rejoined, “O my brother, knowest thou not of hair
and wool that they be the wear of the pious and the religious,
whereof one of the poets hath spoken in these words:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Folk who in fear of long accompt<a id="r289"></a><a href="#f289" class="c011"><sup>[289]</sup></a> for naught of worldly care ✿ Hail to them! haply garb of wool they’ll change for silken wear:</div>
      <div class="line">In life for provaunt shall suffice them salt and barley-bread ✿ Who seek th’ Almighty Lord and bow the head in sedulous pray’r.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Birdie resumed, “In very deed thy speech the sooth doth
teach; but say me what be this staff<a id="r290"></a><a href="#f290" class="c011"><sup>[290]</sup></a> thou hendest in hand?”
Replied the Trap, “O my brother, know that I have become an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>olden man well shotten in years and my strength is minished,
wherefor I have taken me a staff that I may prop me thereon and
that it aid my endeavour when a-fasting.” The Fowl-let pursued,
“Thy speech is true, O my brother, and thou speakest as due, yet
would I ask thee of a matter nor refuse me information thereanent:
tell me why and wherefore this plenty of grain scattered all about
thee?” The Trap answered, “Indeed the merchants and men of
wealth bring to me this victual that I may bestow it in charity
upon the Fakir and the famisht;” and the Birdie rejoined, “O my
brother, I also am an-hungered; so dost thou enjoin me to eat
thereof?” “Thou art my companion,” cried the Trap, “so upon
me such injunction is a bounden duty,” presently adding, “Be so
kind, O my brother, and haste thee hither and eat.” Hereat the
Fowl-let flew down from off his tree and approaching little by
little (with a heart beating for fear of the Trap) picked up a few
grains which lay beside it until he came to the corn set in the loop
of the springe. Hereupon he pecked at it with one peck nor had
he gained aught of good therefrom ere the Trap came down heavily
upon him and entangled his neck and held him fast. Hereupon
he was seized with a fit of sore affright and he cried out “Zík!
zík!” and “Mík! mík!<a id="r291"></a><a href="#f291" class="c011"><sup>[291]</sup></a> Verily I have fallen into wreak and am
betrayed by friendly freke and oh, the excess of my trouble and
tweak, Zík! Zík! O Thou who kennest my case, do Thou enable
me escape to seek, and save me from these straits unique and be
Thou ruthful to me the meek!” Thereupon quoth to him the
Trap, “Thou criest out Zik! Zik! and hast fallen into straits
unique and hast strayed from the way didst seek, O Miscreant and
Zindík,<a id="r292"></a><a href="#f292" class="c011"><sup>[292]</sup></a> and naught shall avail thee at this present or brother or
friend veridique or familiar freke. Now understand and thy pleasure
seek! I have deceived thee with a deceit and thou lentest ear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_159">159</span>and lustedst.” Replied the Bird, “I am one whom desire hath
cast down and ignorance hath seduced and inordinate greed, one
for whose neck the collar of destruction is fitted and I have fallen
along with those who lowest fall!” Hereupon the Fowler came
up with his knife to slaughter the Fowl-let and began saying,
“How many a birdie have we taken in all ease for desire of its
meat that we may dress their heads with rice or in Harísah<a id="r293"></a><a href="#f293" class="c011"><sup>[293]</sup></a> or
fried in pan and eat thereof pleasurably myself or feed therewith
great men and grandees. Also ’tis on us incumbent to feed privily
upon half the bodies and the other half shall be for our guests
whilst I will take the wings to set before my family and kinsmen
as the most excellent of gifts.”<a id="r294"></a><a href="#f294" class="c011"><sup>[294]</sup></a> Hearing these words the Bird
fell to speaking and saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Birder, my mother’s in misery ✿ And blind with weeping my loss is she.</div>
      <div class="line">I suffice not thy guest nor can serve for gift: ✿ Have ruth and compassion and set me free!</div>
      <div class="line">With my parents I’ll bless thee and then will I ✿ Fly a-morn and at e’en-tide return to thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently resumed he, “Seest thou not how my meat be mean and
my maw be lean; nor verily can I stand thee in stead of cate nor
thy hunger satiate: so fear Allah and set me at liberty then shall
the Almighty requite thee with an abundant requital.” But the
Fowler far from heeding his words, made him over to his son
saying, “O my child, take this bird and faring homewards
slaughter him and of him cook for us a cumin-ragout and a lemon-stew,
a mess flavoured with verjuice and a second of mushrooms
and a third with pomegranate seeds and a fourth of clotted curd<a id="r295"></a><a href="#f295" class="c011"><sup>[295]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>cooked with Summák,<a id="r296"></a><a href="#f296" class="c011"><sup>[296]</sup></a> and a fine fry and eke conserves of pears<a id="r297"></a><a href="#f297" class="c011"><sup>[297]</sup></a>
and quinces and apples and apricots hight the rose-water and
vermicelli<a id="r298"></a><a href="#f298" class="c011"><sup>[298]</sup></a> and Sikbáj;<a id="r299"></a><a href="#f299" class="c011"><sup>[299]</sup></a> and meat dressed with the six leaves and
a porridge<a id="r300"></a><a href="#f300" class="c011"><sup>[300]</sup></a> and a rice-milk, and an ’Ajíjíyah<a id="r301"></a><a href="#f301" class="c011"><sup>[301]</sup></a> and fried flesh in
strips and Kabábs and meat-olives and dishes the like of these.
Also do thou make of his guts strings for bows and of his gullet a
conduit for the terrace-roof and of his skin a tray-cloth and of his
plumage cushions and pillows.” Now when the Fowl-let heard
these words (and he was still in the Fowler’s hand), he laughed a
laugh of sorrow and cried, “Woe to thee, O Birder whither be
wended thy wits and thine understanding? Art Jinn-mad or
wine-drunken? Art age-foolish or asleep? Art heavy-minded or
remiss in thought? Indeed had I been that long-necked bird the
’Anká, daughter of Life, or were I the she-camel of Sálih to be, or
the ram of Isaac the sacrificed, or the loquent calf of Al-Sámiri<a id="r302"></a><a href="#f302" class="c011"><sup>[302]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>or even a buffalo fattened daintily all this by thee mentioned had
never come from me.” Hereat he fell to improvising and saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The Ruthful forbiddeth the eating of me ✿ And His Grace doth grace me with clemency:</div>
      <div class="line">A Camel am I whom they overload ✿ And the Birder is daft when my flesh seeth he:</div>
      <div class="line">From Solomon’s breed, O my God I have hope: ✿ If he kill me the Ruthful his drowning<a id="r303"></a><a href="#f303" class="c011"><sup>[303]</sup></a> decree.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then quoth the Fowl to the Fowler, “An thou design to slaughter
me in thy greed even as thou hast described, verily I shall avail thee
naught, but an thou work my weal and set me free I will show thee
somewhat shall profit thee and further the fortunes of thy sons’ sons
and thy latest descendants.” “What is that direction thou wouldst
deal to me?” asked the Fowler, and answered the Fowl-let, “I will
teach a trio of words all-wise and will discover to thee in this earth
a Hoard wherewith thou and thy seed and posterity shall ever be
satisfied and shall ever pray for the lengthening of my years.
Moreover I will point out to thee a pair of Falcons ashen-grey,
big of body and burly of bulk, who are to me true friends and
whom thou didst leave in the gardens untrapped.” Asked the
Birder, “And what be the three words which so savour of
wisdom?” and answered the other, “O Fowler, the three words
of wisdom are:—Bemourn not what is the past nor at the future
rejoice too fast nor believe aught save that whereon thy glance is
cast. But as regards the Hoard and the two Falcons, when thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_162">162</span>shalt have released me I will point them out to thee and right soon
to thee shall be shown the sooth of whatso I have said to thee.”
Hereat the Birder’s heart became well affected towards the Birdie
for his joy anent the Treasure and the Falcons; and the device of
the captive deceived the Capturer and cut short his wits so that he
at once released the prey. Forthright the Fowl-let flew forth the
Fowler’s palm in huge delight at having saved his life from death;
then, after preening his plume and spreading his pinions and
his wings, he laughed until he was like to fall earthwards in a
fainting-fit. Anon he began to gaze right and left, long breaths
a-drawing and increase of gladness ever a-showing; whereupon
quoth the Birder, “O Father of Flight, O thou The Wind hight!
what saidst thou to me anent pointing out the two Falcons ashen-grey
and who were the comrades thou leftest in the gardens?”
Quoth the Birdie in reply, “Alack and alas! never saw I thy
like for an ass nor aught than thyself meaner of capacity nor
mightier of imbecility; for indeed thou carriest in thy head lightness
and in thy wits slackness. O Scant of sense, when sawest
thou ever a sparrow company with a Falcon, much less with
two Falcons? So short is thine understanding that I have
escaped thy hand by devising the simplest device which my
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nous</span></i> and knowledge suggested.” Hereat he began to improvise
and repeat:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“When Fortune easy was, from duty<a id="r304"></a><a href="#f304" class="c011"><sup>[304]</sup></a> didst forbear ✿ Nor from that malady<a id="r305"></a><a href="#f305" class="c011"><sup>[305]</sup></a> hast safety or repair:</div>
      <div class="line">Then blame thyself nor cast on other wight<a id="r306"></a><a href="#f306" class="c011"><sup>[306]</sup></a> the fault ✿ And lacking all excuse to death of misery fare!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then resumed the Fowl-let, “Woe to thee, O mean and mesquin,
thou wottedst not that which thou hast lost in me, for indeed baulked
is thy bent and foiled is thy fortune and near to thee is poverty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_163">163</span>and nigh to thee is obscurity. Hadst thou when taking me cut my
throat and cloven my crop thou hadst found therein a jewel the
weight of an ounce which I picked up and swallowed from the
treasury of Kisrà Anúshírwán the King.” But when the Birder
heard the Birdie’s words he scattered dust upon his head and
buffeted his face and plucked out his beard and rent his raiment,
and at last slipped down a-swooning to the ground. And presently
recovering his senses he looked towards his late captive and cried,
“O Father of Flight, O thou The Wind hight, say me is there any
return for thee me-wards, where thou shalt with me abide, and thee
within the apple of mine eye will I hide, and after all this toil and
turmoil I will perfume and fumigate thee with ambergris and with
Comorin lign-aloes, and I will bring thee sugar for food and nuts
of the pine<a id="r307"></a><a href="#f307" class="c011"><sup>[307]</sup></a> and with me thou shalt tarry in highmost degree?”
Replied the Birdie, “O miserable, past is that which passed; I
mean, suffice me not thy fraud and thy flattering falsehood. And
laud to the Lord, O thou meanest of men, how soon hast thou
forgotten the three charges wherewith I charged thee! And how
short are thy wits seeing that the whole of me weighteth not ten
drachms<a id="r308"></a><a href="#f308" class="c011"><sup>[308]</sup></a> and how then can I bear in crop a jewel weighing an
ounce? How far from thee is subtilty and how speedily hast thou
forgotten mine injunctions wherewith I enjoined thee saying:—Believe
not aught save that whereon thine eye is cast nor regret
and bemourn the past nor at what cometh rejoice too fast. These
words of wisdom are clean gone from thy memory, and hadst thou
been nimble of wits thou hadst slaughtered me forthright: however,
Alhamdolillah—Glory to God, who caused me not to savour the
whittle’s sharp edge, and I thank my Lord for my escape and for
the loosing of my prosperity from the trap of trouble.” Now when
the Birder heard these words of the Birdie he repented and regretted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>his folly, and he cried, “O my sorrow for what failed me of the
slaughter of this volatile, and as he sank on the ground he sang:—<a id="r309"></a><a href="#f309" class="c011"><sup>[309]</sup></a></p>

    <div><span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span><b>Here we begin to write and indite the Tale of a man of Syria, Attaf hight.</b><a id="r310"></a><a href="#f310" class="c011"><sup>[310]</sup></a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">They relate (but Allah is All-knowing of His unknown and All-cognisant
of what forewent in the annals of folk and the wonders
of yore, and of times long gone before!) that in the city of Shám<a id="r311"></a><a href="#f311" class="c011"><sup>[311]</sup></a>
there dwelt of old a man Attáf hight, who rivalled Hátim of Tayy<a id="r312"></a><a href="#f312" class="c011"><sup>[312]</sup></a>
in his generosity and his guest-love and in his self-control as to
manners and morals. Now he lived in the years when the Caliph
Harun al-Rashid was reigning in Baghdad-city, and it happened
on a day of the days that this Commander of the Faithful awoke
morne and melancholic, and right straitened was his breast. So
he arose, and taking Ja’afar the Barmecide and Masrúr the Eunuch
passed with them into the place where his treasures were stored.
Presently quoth he to the Wazir, “O Ja’afar, open to me this
door that I may solace me with the sight, and my breast may
be broadened and haply be gladdened by such spectacle.” The
<span class="pageno" id="Page_168">168</span>Minister did the bidding of his lord, who, finding a room full of
books, put forth his hand, and taking up one of the volumes,
opened and read. Then he fell to weeping thrice, and thrice to
laughing aloud,<a id="r313"></a><a href="#f313" class="c011"><sup>[313]</sup></a> whereat the Wazir considered him and cried, “O
King of the Age, how is it I espy thee reading and weeping and
laughing at one and the same moment when none so act save
madmen and maniacs?”<a id="r314"></a><a href="#f314" class="c011"><sup>[314]</sup></a> And having spoken on this wise he held
his peace; but the Prince of True Believers turned himwards and
cried, “O dog of the sons of Bermak, I see thee going beyond
thy degree and quitting the company of sensible men, and thou
speakest vainly making me a madman in saying:—None laugh and
cry at one and the same time save maniacs?” With these words
the Caliph restored the volume to its place in the Treasury and
bade lock the door, after which the three returned to the Divan.
Here the Commander of the Faithful regarded Ja’afar and
exclaimed, “Go thou forth from before me and address me not
again nor seat thee upon the Wazirial seat until thou answer
thine own question and thou return me a reply concerning that
which is writ and aligned in yonder book I was reading, to the end
thou learn why I wept and wherefore I laught at one and the same
hour.” And he cried at him in anger saying, “Off and away with
thee, nor face me again save with the answer, else will I slay thee
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>with the foulest of slaughter.” Accordingly Ja’afar fared forth and
hardly could he see with his eyes, and he kept saying to himself,
“Indeed I have fallen with a sore fall; foul befal it for a fall; how
fulsome it is!” Then he fared homewards where he encountered
face to face his father Yahyá the Bermaki, who was issuing from the
mansion and he recounted to him the tale, whereat his parent said,
“Go at once, abide not here, but turn thee Damascus-wards until shall
terminate this decline of fortune and this disjunction of favour, and
at the ending thereof thou shalt see wonders therein.”<a id="r315"></a><a href="#f315" class="c011"><sup>[315]</sup></a> Ja’afar
replied, “Not until I shall have laid a charge upon my Harím;”<a id="r316"></a><a href="#f316" class="c011"><sup>[316]</sup></a> but
Yahya cried, “Enter not these doors, hie thee at once to Al-Shám, for
even so ’tis determined by Destiny.” Accordingly the Wazir gave
ear to his sire, and taking a bag containing one thousand dinars
and slinging on his sword farewelled him; then, mounting a
she-mule, alone and unattended by slave or page, he rode off and
he ceased not riding for ten days full-told until he arrived at the
Marj<a id="r317"></a><a href="#f317" class="c011"><sup>[317]</sup></a> or mead of Damascus. Now it so fortuned that on that
same day Attaf,<a id="r318"></a><a href="#f318" class="c011"><sup>[318]</sup></a> a fair youth and a well-known of the “Smile of
the Prophet,” and one of the noblest and most generous of her
sons had pitched tents and had spread a banquet outside the city,
where chancing to sight Ja’afar mounted on his beast, he knew him
to be a wayfarer passing by, and said to his slaves, “Call to me
yonder man!” They did his bidding and the stranger rode up to
the party of friends, and dismounting from his mule saluted them
with the salam which they all returned. Then they sat for a while<a id="r319"></a><a href="#f319" class="c011"><sup>[319]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>after which Attaf arose and led Ja’afar to his house companied by
all the company which was there and they paced into a spacious
open hall and seated themselves in converse for an hour full-told.
Anon the slaves brought them a table spread with the evening
meal and bearing more than ten several manners of meat. So
they ate and were cheered, and after the guests had washed hands,
the eunuchs and attendants brought in candles of honey-coloured
wax that shed a brilliant light, and presently the musicians came
in band and performed a right royal partition while the servants
served up conserves for dessert. So they ate, and when they had
eaten their sufficiency they<a id="r320"></a><a href="#f320" class="c011"><sup>[320]</sup></a> drank coffee; and finally, at their
ease and in their own good time, all the guests arose and made
obeisance and fared homewards. Then Attaf and Ja’afar sat at
table for an hour or so, during which the host offered his guest an
hundred greetings, saying, “All kinds of blessings have descended
from Heaven upon our heads. Tell me, how was it thou honouredst
us, and what was the cause of thy coming and of thy favouring us
with thy footsteps?”<a id="r321"></a><a href="#f321" class="c011"><sup>[321]</sup></a> So Ja’afar disclosed to him his name and
office<a id="r322"></a><a href="#f322" class="c011"><sup>[322]</sup></a> and told him the reasons of his ride to Damascus from
the beginning to the end full and detailed, whereto Attaf rejoined,
“Tarry with me an thou please a decade of years; and grieve not
at all, for thy Worship is owner of this place.” After this the
eunuchs came in and spread for Ja’afar bedding delicately wrought
at the head of the hall and its honour-stead, and disposed other
sleeping-gear alongside thereof, which seeing the Wazir said to himself,
“Haply my host is a bachelor, that they would spread his bed
by my side; however, I will venture the question.” Accordingly he
addressed his host saying, “O Attaf, art thou single or married?”<a id="r323"></a><a href="#f323" class="c011"><sup>[323]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>“I am married, O my lord,” quoth the other, whereat Ja’afar
resumed, “Wherefore dost thou not go within and lie with thy
Harím?” “O my lord,” replied Attaf, “the Harim is not about to
take flight, and it would be naught but disgraceful to me were I
to leave a visitor like thyself, a man by all revered, to sleep alone
while I fare to-night with my Harim and rise betimes to enter the
Hammam.<a id="r324"></a><a href="#f324" class="c011"><sup>[324]</sup></a> In me such action would I deem be want of courtesy
and failure in honouring a magnifico like thine Honour. In very
sooth, O my lord, so long as thy presence deign favour this house
I will not sleep within my Harem until I farewell thy Worship and
thou depart in peace and safety to thine own place.” “This be a
marvellous matter,” quoth Ja’afar to himself, “and peradventure
he so doeth the more to make much of me.” So they lay
together that night and when morning morrowed they arose and
fared to the Baths whither Attaf had sent for the use of his
guest a suit of magnificent clothes, and caused Ja’afar don it
before leaving the Hammam. Then finding the horses at the
door, they mounted and repaired to the Lady’s Tomb,<a id="r325"></a><a href="#f325" class="c011"><sup>[325]</sup></a> and spent
a day worthy to be numbered in men’s lives. Nor did they
cease visiting place after place by day and sleeping in the same
stead by night, in the way we have described, for the space of
four months, after which time the soul of the Wazir Ja’afar waxed
sad and sorry, and one chance day of the days, he sat him down
and wept. Seeing him in tears Attaf asked him, saying, “Allah
fend from thee all affliction, O my lord! why dost thou weep and
wherefore art thou grieved? An thou be heavy of heart why not
relate to me what hath oppressed thee?” Answered Ja’afar,
“O my brother, I find my breast sore straitened and I would
<span class="pageno" id="Page_172">172</span>fain stroll about the streets of Damascus and solace me with
seeing the Cathedral-mosque of the Ommiades.”<a id="r326"></a><a href="#f326" class="c011"><sup>[326]</sup></a> “And who, O
my lord,” responded the other, “would hinder thee therefrom?
Do thou deign wander whither thou wilt and take thy solace, so
may thy spirits be gladdened and thy breast be broadened.
Herein is none to let or stay thee at all, at all.” Hearing these
words Ja’afar arose to fare forth, when quoth his host, “O my
lord, shall they saddle thee a hackney?” but the other replied,
“O my friend, I would not be mounted for that the man on horseback
may not divert himself by seeing the folk; nay the folk
enjoy themselves by looking upon him.” Quoth Attaf, “At
least delay thee a while that I may supply thee with spending
money to bestow upon the folk; and then fare forth and walk
about to thy content and solace thyself with seeing whatso thou
wilt; so mayest thou be satisfied and no more be sorrowed.”
Accordingly, Ja’afar took from Attaf a purse of three hundred
dinars and left the house gladly as one who issueth from durance
vile, and he turned into the city and began a-wandering about the
streets of Damascus and enjoying the spectacle; and at last he
entered the Jámi’ al-Amawi where he prayed the usual prayers.
After this he resumed his strolling about pleasant places until he
came to a narrow street and found a bench formed of stone<a id="r327"></a><a href="#f327" class="c011"><sup>[327]</sup></a> set
in the ground. Hereon he took seat to rest a while, and he
looked about, when behold, fronting him were latticed windows
wherein stood cases planted with sweet-smelling herbs.<a id="r328"></a><a href="#f328" class="c011"><sup>[328]</sup></a> And
hardly had he looked before those casements were opened and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>suddenly appeared thereat a young lady,<a id="r329"></a><a href="#f329" class="c011"><sup>[329]</sup></a> a model of comeliness
and loveliness and fair figure and symmetrical grace, whose
charms would amate all who upon her gaze, and she began
watering her plants. Ja’afar cast upon her a single glance and
was sore hurt by her beauty and brilliancy; but she, after looking
upon the lattices and watering the herbs to the extent they
required turned her round and gazed adown the street where she
caught a sight of Ja’afar sitting and earnestly eyeing her. So she
barred the windows and disappeared. But the Minister lingered
on the bench hoping and expecting that haply the casement would
open a second time and allow him another look at her; and as
often as he would have risen up his nature said to him, “Sit thee
down.” And he stinted not so doing till evening came on, when
he arose and returned to the house of Attaf, whom he found
standing at the gateway to await him, and presently his host exclaimed,
“’Tis well, O my lord! during all this delay indeed my
thoughts have gone with thee for that I have long been expecting
thy return.” “’Tis such a while since I walked abroad,” answered
Ja’afar, “that I had needs look about me and console my soul,
wherefor I lingered and loitered.” Then they entered the house
and sat down, when the eunuchs served up on trays the evening
meal, and the Minister drew near to eat thereof but was wholly
unable, so he cast from his hand the spoon and arose. Hereat
quoth his host, “Why, O my lord, canst thou not eat?” “Because
this day’s noon-meal hath been heavy to me and hindereth
my supping; but ’tis no matter!” quoth the other. And when
the hour for sleep came Ja’afar retired to rest; but in his excitement
by the beauty of that young lady he could not close eye, for
her charms had mastered the greater part of his sense and had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>snared his senses as much as might be; nor could he do aught
save groan and cry, “Ah miserable me! who shall enjoy thy
presence, O full Moon of the Age and who shall look upon that
comeliness and loveliness?” And he ceased not being feverish
and to twist and turn upon his couch until late morning, and he
was as one lost<a id="r330"></a><a href="#f330" class="c011"><sup>[330]</sup></a> with love; but as soon as it was the undurn-hour
Attaf came in to him and said, “How is thy health? My
thoughts have been settled on thee: and I see that thy slumber
hath lasted until between dawn and midday: indeed I deem that
thou hast lain awake o’night and hast not slept until so near
the mid-forenoon.” “O my brother, I have no Kayf,”<a id="r331"></a><a href="#f331" class="c011"><sup>[331]</sup></a> replied
Ja’afar. So the host forthwith sent a white slave to summon a
physician, and the man did his bidding, and after a short delay
brought one who was the preventer<a id="r332"></a><a href="#f332" class="c011"><sup>[332]</sup></a> of his day. And when
ushered into Ja’afar’s room he addressed the sick man, “There
is no harm to thee and boon of health befal thee:<a id="r333"></a><a href="#f333" class="c011"><sup>[333]</sup></a> say me what
aileth thee?” “All is excitement<a id="r334"></a><a href="#f334" class="c011"><sup>[334]</sup></a> with me,” answered the other,
whereat the Leach putting forth his fingers felt the wrist of his
patient, when he found the pulsations pulsing strong and the
intermissions intermitting regularly.<a id="r335"></a><a href="#f335" class="c011"><sup>[335]</sup></a> Noting this he was ashamed
to declare before his face, “Thou art in love!” so he kept
silence and presently said to Attaf, “I will write thee a recipe
containing all that is required by the case.” “Write!” said the
host, and the Physician sat down to indite his prescription, when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>behold, a white slave came in and said to his lord, “Thy Harim
requireth thee.” So the host arose and retired to learn what was
wanted of him in the women’s apartments, and when his wife
saw him she asked, “O my lord, what is thy pleasure that we
cook for dinner and supper?” “Whatsoever may be wanted,”
he rejoined and went his ways, for since Ja’afar had been guested
in his house Attaf had not once entered the inner rooms according
as he had before declared to the Minister. Now the Physician
during the host’s visit to the Harem had written out the prescription
and had placed it under the pillow of the patient, and as he
was leaving the house he came suddenly upon the housemaster on
return to the men’s apartment, and Attaf asked him, “Hast thou
written thy prescription?” “Yes,” answered the Leach, “I
have written it and set it under his head.” Thereupon the host
pulled out a piastre<a id="r336"></a><a href="#f336" class="c011"><sup>[336]</sup></a> and therewith fee’d the physician; after
which he went up to Ja’afar’s couch and drew the paper from
under his pillow and read it and saw therein written,<a id="r337"></a><a href="#f337" class="c011"><sup>[337]</sup></a> “O Attaf,
verily thy guest is a lover, so do thou look for her he loveth and
for his state purvey and make not overmuch delay.” So the host
addressed his guest, saying, “Thou art now become one of us:
why then hide from me thy case and conceal from me thy condition?
This Doctor, than whom is none keener or cleverer in
Damascus, hath learned all that befel thee.” Hereupon he produced
the paper and showed it to Ja’afar, who took it and read it
with a smile; then he cried, “This Physician is a master leach
and his saying is soothfast. Know that on the day when I went
forth from thee and sauntered about the streets and lanes, there
befel me a matter which I never had thought to have betided me;
no, never; and I know not what shall become of me for that, O
my brother Attaf, my case is one involving life-loss.” And he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>told him all that had happened to himself; how when seated upon
the bench a lattice had been unclosed afront of him and he had
seen a young lady, the loveliest of her time, who had thrown it
open and had come forward to water her window-garden; adding,
“Now my heart was upstirred by love to her, and she had suddenly
withdrawn after looking down the street and closed the casement
as soon as she had seen a stranger gazing upon her. Again and
again I was minded to rise and retire but desire for her kept me
seated in the hope that haply she would again throw open the
lattice and allow me the favour of another glimpse, so could I see
her a second time. However, inasmuch as she did not show till
evening came on I arose and repaired hither, but of my exceeding
agitation for the ardour of love to her I was powerless to touch
meat or drink, and my sleep was broken by the excess of desire
for her which had homed in my heart. And now, O my brother
Attaf, I have made known to thee whatso betided me.” When
the host heard these words, he was certified that the house
whereof Ja’afar spoke was his house and the lattice his own lattice
and the lovely and lovesome young lady his wife the daughter of
his paternal uncle, so he said in his thought, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great. Verily we are Allah’s and unto Him shall we return!”
But presently he regained himself in the nobility of his nature,
and he continued, “O Ja’afar, thine intent is pure for that the
dame thou sawest yesterday was divorced by her husband; and
I will straightway fare to her father and bespeak him to the end
that none may lay hand upon her; and then will I return and
let thee ken all concerning her.” So saying he arose and went
at once to his cousin-wife<a id="r338"></a><a href="#f338" class="c011"><sup>[338]</sup></a> who greeted him and kissing his hand
said to him, “Is thy guest a-going?” Said he, “By no means:
the cause of my coming to thee is not his going, the reason
<span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>thereof is my design of sending thee to the home of thy people,
for that thy father anon met me in the market-street and declared
to me that thy mother is dying of a colick, and said to me:—Go
send her daughter without delay so that she may see her
parent alive and meet her once more.” Accordingly the young wife
arose; and, hardly knowing how she moved for tears at such tidings,
she took her slave-girls with her and repairing to her home rapped
at the door, and her mother who opened to her cried on seeing
her, “May this thy coming (Inshallah!) be well, O my daughter,
but how is it thou comest thus unexpected?” “Inshallah!”
said the wife, “thou art at rest from the colick?” and the mother
rejoined, “Who told thee I was colicky? but pass thou within.”
So she entered the court and her father, Abdullah Chelebi hight,<a id="r339"></a><a href="#f339" class="c011"><sup>[339]</sup></a>
hearing her footstep from an inner room, asked, “What is there
to do?” “Thou mettest anon,” replied his daughter, “Attaf thy
son-in-law in the Bazar and didst tell him that my mother was
sore afflicted with a colick.” Hearing this he exclaimed, “This day
I went not once to the market-street nor have I seen a soul!” Now
they had not ceased conversing ere the door was rapped; and as
the slave girls opened it, they saw porters laden with the young
lady’s gear and garments and they led the men into the court
where the father asked them, “Who sent these stuffs?” “Attaf,”
they replied, and setting down their loads within went their way.
Then the father turned to his daughter and said to her, “What
deed hast done that my son-in-law bade take up thy gear and
have it sent after thee?” And the mother said to him, “Hold thy
peace and speak not such speech lest the honour of the house be
blamed and shamed.” And as they were talking, behold, up came
Attaf companied by a party of friends when his father-in-law
asked him, “Wherefore hast thou done on this wise?” “To-day,”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>answered he, “there came from me a wrongous oath: on account
of my inclination to thy daughter my heart is dark as night
whereas her good name is whiter than my turband and ever
bright.<a id="r340"></a><a href="#f340" class="c011"><sup>[340]</sup></a> Furthermore an occasion befel and this oath fell from my
mouth and I bade her be the owner of herself.<a id="r341"></a><a href="#f341" class="c011"><sup>[341]</sup></a> And now will I
beweep the past and straightway set her free.” So saying he
wrote a writ of repudiation and returning to Ja’afar said, “From
early dawn I have wearied myself<a id="r342"></a><a href="#f342" class="c011"><sup>[342]</sup></a> for thy sake and have so acted
that no man can lay hand upon her. And at last thou mayst now
enjoy life and go to the gardens and the Hammams and take thy
pleasure until the days of her widowhood<a id="r343"></a><a href="#f343" class="c011"><sup>[343]</sup></a> be gone by.” Replied
Ja’afar, “Allah quicken thee for what thou wroughtest of kindness
to me,” and Attaf rejoined, “Find for thyself something thou
requirest, O my brother.”<a id="r344"></a><a href="#f344" class="c011"><sup>[344]</sup></a> Then he fell to taking him every day
amongst the crowd of pleasure-seekers and solacing him with a
show of joyous spectacles<a id="r345"></a><a href="#f345" class="c011"><sup>[345]</sup></a> till the term of divorce had sped, when
he said to the Wazir, “O Ja’afar, I would counsel thee with an
especial counsel.” “And what may it be, O my brother?” quoth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_179">179</span>the other; and quoth he, “Know, O my lord, that many of the
folk have found the likeness between thy Honour and Ja’afar the
Barmecide, wherefore must I fain act on this wise. I will bring
thee a troop of ten Mamelukes and four servants on horseback,
with whom do thou fare privily and by night forth the city and
presently transmit to me tidings from outside the walls that thou
the Grand Wazir, Ja’afar the Barmecide, art recalled to court and
bound thither from Egypt upon business ordered by the Sultan.
Hereat the Governor of Damascus, ’Abd al-Malik bin Marwán<a id="r346"></a><a href="#f346" class="c011"><sup>[346]</sup></a>
and the Grandees of Syria will flock forth to meet and greet thee
with fêtes and feasts, after which do thou send for the young lady’s
sire and of him ask her to wife. Then I will summon the Kazi
and witnesses and will write out without stay or delay the marriage-writ
with a dower of a thousand dinars the while thou makest
ready for wayfare, and if thou journey to Homs or to Hamah
do thou alight at whatso place ever pleaseth thee. Also I will
provide thee of spending-money as much as thy soul can desire
and supply to thee raiment and gear, horses and bât-animals, tents
and pavilions of the cheap and of the dear, all thou canst require.
So what sayest thou concerning this counsel?” “Fair fall it for
the best of rede which hath no peer,” replied Ja’afar. Hereupon
Attaf arose and gathering his men about his guest sent him forth
the city when the Minister wrote a writ and despatched it by
twenty horsemen with a trader to inform the Governor of Syria
that Ja’afar the Barmecide was passing that way and was
about to visit Damascus on the especial service of the Sultan.
So the Kapújí<a id="r347"></a><a href="#f347" class="c011"><sup>[347]</sup></a> entered Damascus and read out the Wazirial
<span class="pageno" id="Page_180">180</span>letter<a id="r348"></a><a href="#f348" class="c011"><sup>[348]</sup></a> announcing Ja’afar’s return from Egypt. Hereat the Governor
arose and after sending a present of provisions<a id="r349"></a><a href="#f349" class="c011"><sup>[349]</sup></a> without the walls
bade pitch the tents, and the Grandees of Syria rode forth to meet
the Minister, and the Headmen of the Province set out to greet
him, and he entered with all honour and consideration. It was
indeed a day fit to be numbered among the days of a man’s life,
a day of general joyance for those present, and they read the
Farmán and they offered the food and the forage to the Chamberlain
and thus it became known to one and all of the folk that a
writ of pardon had come to Ja’afar’s hands and on this wise the
bruit went abroad, far and near, and the Grandees brought him all
manner of presents. After this Ja’afar sent to summon the young
lady’s father and as soon as he appeared in his presence, said
to him, “Thy daughter hath been divorced?” and said the other
“Yes; she is at home with me.” Quoth the Minister, “I would
fain take her to wife;” and quoth the father, “Here am I ready
to send her as thy handmaid.” The Governor of Sham added,
“I will assume charge of the dowry,” and the damsel’s father
rejoined, “It hath already come to hand.”<a id="r350"></a><a href="#f350" class="c011"><sup>[350]</sup></a> Hereat they summoned
the Kazi and wrote out the writ of Ja’afar’s marriage; and,
having ended the ceremony, they distributed meat and drink to
the poor in honour of the wedding, and Abd al-Malik bin Marwan
said to Ja’afar, “Deign, O my lord, come hither with me and
become my guest, and I will set apart for thee a place wherein
thou canst consummate thy marriage.” But the other replied,
“Nay, I may not do so; I am sent on public affairs by the Commander
of the Faithful and I purpose setting off with my bride
and marching without further delay.” The Grandees of Syria
<span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>spent that night until morning without any being able to snatch
a moment of sleep, and as soon as dawned the day Ja’afar sent
to summon his father-in-law and said, “On the morrow I design
setting forth, and I desire that my bride be ready for the road;”
whereto replied the other, “Upon my head be it and my eyes!”
Then Abdullah Chelebi fared homewards and said to his daughter,
“O my child, Attaf hath divorced thee from bed and from board,
whereas Sultan Ja’afar the Bermaki hath taken thee to wife, and
on Allah is the repairing of our broken fortunes and the fortifying
of our hearts.” And she held her peace for displeasure
by cause that she loved Attaf on account of the blood-tie and
his exceeding great generosity. But on the next day Ja’afar
sent a message to her sire informing him that the march would
begin about mid-afternoon and that he wished him to make all
ready, so the father did accordingly; and when Attaf heard
thereof he sent supplies and spending-money.<a id="r351"></a><a href="#f351" class="c011"><sup>[351]</sup></a> At the time
appointed the Minister took horse escorted by the Governor and
the Grandees, and they brought out the mule-litter<a id="r352"></a><a href="#f352" class="c011"><sup>[352]</sup></a> wherein was
the bride, and the procession rode onwards until they had reached
the Dome of the Birds,<a id="r353"></a><a href="#f353" class="c011"><sup>[353]</sup></a> whereat the Minister bade them return
home and they obeyed him and farewelled him. But on the ride
back they all met Attaf coming from the city, and he reined in
his horse and saluted the Governor and exchanged salams with
his companions, who said to him, “Now at the very time we are
going in thou comest out.” Attaf made answer, “I wotted not
that he would set forth this day, but as soon as I was certified
that he had mounted I sent to summon his escort and came forth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_182">182</span>a-following him.”<a id="r354"></a><a href="#f354" class="c011"><sup>[354]</sup></a> To this the Governor replied, “Go catch them
up at the Dome of the Birds, where they are now halting.”
Attaf followed this counsel and reaching the place alighted from
his mare, and approaching Ja’afar embraced him and cried,
“Laud to the Lord, O brother mine, who returneth thee to thy
home with fortunes repaired and heart fortified;” and said the
Minister, “O Attaf, Allah place it in my power to requite thee;
but cease thou not to write me and apprise me of thy tidings;
and for the nonce I order thee to return hence and not to lie the
night save in thine own house.” And his host did his bidding
whilst the cousin-wife hearing his voice thrust her head out of the
litter and looked upon him with flowing tears, understanding the
length to which his generosity had carried him. So fared it with
Attaf and his affair; but now give ear to what befel him from
Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. As they hied them home one who
hated the generous man asked the Governor, “Wottest thou the
wherefore he went forth to farewell his quondam guest at so
late a time as this?” “Why so?” answered the other; and the
detractor continued, “Ja’afar hath tarried four months as a guest
in his household, and disguised so that none save the host knew
him, and now Attaf fared not forth for his sake but because of the
woman.” “What woman?” enquired the Governor, and the
other replied, “His whilom wife, whom he divorced for the sake
of his stranger, and married her to him; so this day he followeth
to enjoin him once more concerning the Government of Syria
which perchance is promised to him. And ’tis better that thou
breakfast upon him ere he sup upon thee.” The other enquired,
“And whose daughter is she, is not her sire Abdullah Chelebi?”<a id="r355"></a><a href="#f355" class="c011"><sup>[355]</sup></a>
Whereto the man answered, “Yes, O my lord, and I repeat that
she was put away to the intent that Ja’afar might espouse her.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>When the Governor heard these words, he was wroth with wrath
galore than which naught could be more, and he hid his anger
from Attaf for a while of time until he had devised a device to
compass his destruction. At last, one day of the days he bade cast
the corpse of a murthered man into his enemy’s garden and after
the body was found by spies he had sent to discover the slayer,
he summoned Attaf and asked him, “Who murthered yon man
within thy grounds?” Replied the other, “’Twas I slew him.”
“And why didst slay him?” cried the Governor, “and what harm
hath he wrought thee?” But the generous one replied, “O my
lord, I have confessed to the slaughter of this man in order that
I and only I may be mulcted in his blood-wite lest the neighbours
say:—By reason of Attaf’s garden we have been condemned to
pay his fine.” Quoth Abd al-Malik, “Why should I want to take
mulcts from the folk? Nay; I would command according to
Holy Law and even as Allah hath ordered, ‘A life for a life.’”
He then turned for testimony to those present and asked them,
“What said this man?” and they answered, “He said:—I slew
him.” “Is the accused in his right mind or Jinn-mad<a id="r356"></a><a href="#f356" class="c011"><sup>[356]</sup></a>?” pursued
the Governor; and they said, “In his senses.” Then quoth
the Governor to the Mufti, “O Efendi, deliver me thine official
decision according to that thou heardest from the accused’s
mouth;” and the Judge pronounced and indited his sentence
upon the criminal according to his confession. Hereupon the
Governor gave order for his slaves to plunder the house and
bastinado the owner; then he called for the headsman, but the
Notables interfered and cried, “Give him a delay, for thou hast
<span class="pageno" id="Page_184">184</span>no right to slay him without further evidence; and better send
him to gaol.” Now all Damascus was agitated and excited by
this affair, which came upon the folk so suddenly and unforeseen.
And Attaf’s friends<a id="r357"></a><a href="#f357" class="c011"><sup>[357]</sup></a> and familiars came down upon the Governor
and went about spreading abroad that the generous man had not
spoken such words save in fear lest his neighbours be molested
and be mulcted for a murther which they never committed, and
that he was wholly innocent of such crime. So Abd al-Malik
bin Marwan summoned them and said, “And ye plead that
the accused is Jinn-mad this were folly, for he is the prince
of intelligent men: I was resolved to let him live until the
morrow; but I have been thwarted and this very night I will
send and have him strangled.” Hereupon he returned him to
prison and ordered the gaoler to do him die before day might
break. But the man waxed wroth with exceeding wrath to hear
the doom devised for Attaf and having visited him in prison
said to him, “Verily the Governor is determined to slay thee for
he was not satisfied with the intercession made for thee by the
folk or even with taking the legal blood-wite.” Hereat Attaf wept
and cried, “Allah (be He magnified and glorified!) hath assigned
unto every death a cause. I desired but to do good amongst the
garden folk and prevent their being fined; and now this benevolence
hath become the reason of my ruin.” Then, after much
‘say and said’ the gaoler spake as follows, “Why talk after such
fashion? I am resolved to set thee free and to ransom thee with
my life; and at this very moment I will strike off thy chains and
deliver thee from him. But do thou arise and tear my face and
pluck out my beard and rend my raiment; then, after thrusting a
gag<a id="r358"></a><a href="#f358" class="c011"><sup>[358]</sup></a> into my mouth wend thy ways and save thy life and leave
me to bear all blame.”<a id="r359"></a><a href="#f359" class="c011"><sup>[359]</sup></a> Quoth Attaf, “Allah requite thee for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>me with every weal!” Accordingly the gaoler did as he had
undertaken and his prisoner went forth unhurt and at once followed
the road to Baghdad. So far concerning him; but now hear thou
what befel the Governor of Syria, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan.
He took patience till midnight, when he arose and fared
accompanied by the headsman to the gaol that he might witness
the strangling of Attaf; but lo and behold! he found the prison-door
wide open and the keeper in sore sorrow with his raiment all
rent to rags and his beard plucked out and his face scratched and
the blood trickling from his four sides and his case was the
miserablest of cases. So they removed the gag from his mouth
and the Governor asked him, “Who did with thee on this wise?”
and the man answered, “O my lord, yesternight, about the middle
thereof, a gang of vagabonds and ne’er-do-wells as they were ’Ifrits
of our lord Sulayman (upon whom be The Peace!), not one of
whom I recognised, came upon me and ere I was ware of them
they broke down the prison door and killed me;<a id="r360"></a><a href="#f360" class="c011"><sup>[360]</sup></a> and when I
would have cried aloud and shouted for aid they placed yonder
gag in my mouth, then they wounded me and shredded my dress
and left me in the state thou seest. Moreover they took Attaf
after breaking his chains and said to him:—Go and lay thy
complaint before the Sultan.” Now those who accompanied
the Governor said, “This be a gaoler and the son of a gaoler,
nor during all his days hath anyone charged him with letting a
prisoner out of hand.” Quoth Abd al-Malik to the wounded man
“Hie thee to thy house and stay there;” whereat he straightway
arose and went his ways. After this the Governor took horse, he
and his escort; and all rode off to search for Attaf during a term
of four days and some of them dug and dug deep down while the
others returned after a bootless errand, and reported that they
had failed to find him. Such was the case with the Governor of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>Syria; and now give ear to the adventure of Attaf. He left not
wayfaring until but a single stage remained between him and
Baghdad when robbers came upon him and stripped him of all his
clothes, so that he was compelled to enter the capital in foulest
condition, naked even as his mother bare him. And after some
charitable wight had thrown an old robe about him and bound his
head with a clout (and his unshorn hair fell over his eyes)<a id="r361"></a><a href="#f361" class="c011"><sup>[361]</sup></a> he fell
to asking for the mansion of the Wazir Ja’afar and the folk guided
him thereto. But when he would have entered the attendants
suffered him not; so he stood at that gate till an old man joined
him. Attaf enquired of him saying, “Hast thou with thee, O
Shaykh, an ink-case and pens and paper?” and the other replied,
“I have; but what is thy need thereof? tell me, so may I write
for thee.” “I will write myself,” rejoined Attaf; and when the
old man handed to him the gear, he took seat and indited an
address to Ja’afar informing him of all that passed from first to
last, and especially of his own foul plight.<a id="r362"></a><a href="#f362" class="c011"><sup>[362]</sup></a> Presently he returned
the ink-case and reed pens to the Shaykh; and, going up to the
gate, asked those standing about the doors, “Will ye not admit for
me this missive and place it in the hand of his Highness, Ja’afar
the Bermaki, the Wazir?” “Give it here,” said they, and one of
them took it with the intent of handing it to the Minister when
suddenly the cannon roared;<a id="r363"></a><a href="#f363" class="c011"><sup>[363]</sup></a> the palace was in a hubbub and each
and everyone cried, “What is to do?” Hereat many voices replied,
“The Sultan, who hath been favoured with a man-child, biddeth
decorate the city for seven days.” Hereat the attendant, who had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>charged himself with the letter, threw it in that confusion from his
hand and Attaf was led to gaol as a vagrant. Anon Ja’afar took
horse and, after letting read the Sultan’s rescript about the city-decorations,
gave command that all the prisoners be released,
Attaf amongst the number. As he issued forth the gaol he beheld
all the streets adorned with flags and tapestry, and when
evening approached eating-cloths and trays of food were set
and all fell-to, while sundry said to Attaf who was in pauper
plight, “Come and eat thou;” for it was a popular feast.<a id="r364"></a><a href="#f364" class="c011"><sup>[364]</sup></a>
And affairs went on after this same fashion and the bands made
music and cannon was fired until ended the week of decoration
during which the folk ceased not to-ing and fro-ing. As evening
evened Attaf entered a cathedral-mosque and prayed the night-prayers
when he was accosted by the eunuchs who cried, “Arise
and gang thy gait, that we may close the mosque-door, O Attaf,”
for his name had become known. He replied, “O man, the Apostle
of Allah saith, ‘Whoso striveth for good is as the doer thereof and
the doer is of the people of Paradise:’ so suffer me to sleep here
in some corner;” but quoth the other, “Up with thee and be off:
yesterday they stole me a bit of matting and to-night I will bolt
the door nor allow any to sleep here. And indeed the Apostle of
Allah (whom the Almighty save and assain!) hath forbidden sleep
o’ nights in the mosques.” Attaf had no competence to persuade
the Castrato by placing himself under his protection, albeit he
prayed him sore saying, “I am a stranger in the city nor have
I knowledge of any, so do thou permit me here to pass this
one night and no more.” But as he was again refused he
went forth into the thoroughfares where the street dogs barked at
him, and thence he trudged on to the market where the watchmen
and warders cried out at him, till at last he entered a ruinous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>house where he stumbled when walking and fell over something
which proved to be a youth lately murthered, and in tripping
he fell upon his face and his garments were bewrayed and crimsoned
with blood. And as he stood in doubt as to what must be done
the Wali and the watch, who were going round the town by night,
met him face to face; and as soon as they saw him all rushed at
him in a body and seizing him bore him to the gaol. Here we
leave speaking of him; and now return we to Ja’afar and what
befel him. After he had set out from Damascus and sent back
Attaf from the Dome of the Birds he said in his mind, “Thou art
about to consummate marriage with a damsel and to travel until
thou shalt reach Baghdad, so meanwhile up and take thee an ewer
of water and make the Wuzú and pray.” However, as he purposed
that evening to go in unto the wife of Attaf, controversy
forewent compliments<a id="r365"></a><a href="#f365" class="c011"><sup>[365]</sup></a> and the tent-pitchers, who were sent on
to the next station set up the pavilion of the bride and the other
tents. Ja’afar took patience until every eye however wakeful
waxed sleep-full, at which time he rose up and went in to Attaf’s
wife who, the moment she saw him enter, covered her face with
her hands as from a stranger. “The Peace be upon thee!” said
he and said she, “With thee also be The Peace and the ruth of
Allah and His blessings.” Then he continued, “O daughter of
my father’s brother<a id="r366"></a><a href="#f366" class="c011"><sup>[366]</sup></a> why hast thou placed thy hand upon thy face?
In the lawful there be naught of shameful.” “True, O my lord,”
she replied, “but Modesty is a part of Religion. If to one the like
of thee it be a light matter that the man who guested thee and
served thee with his coin and his case be treated on this wise and
thou have the heart to take his mate from him, then am I but a
slave between thy hands.” “Art thou the divorced wife of Attaf?”
asked Ja’afar, and she answered, “I am.” Quoth he, “And why
<span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>did thy husband on such wise?” and quoth she, “The while I
stood watering plants at the window, thy Highness deigned look
upon me and thou toldest thy love to Attaf, who forthright put
me away and made me wife to thy Worship. And this is wherefore
I conceal from thee my face.” Ja’afar cried, “Thou art now
unlawful to him and licit to me; but presently thou shalt become
illicit to me and legitimate to thy husband: so from this time
forth thou art dearer and more honourable to me than my eyes
and my mother and my sister. But for the moment thy return to
Damascus is not possible for fear of foolish tongues lest they prattle
and say:—Attaf went forth to farewell Ja’afar, and his wife lay the
night with the former, and thus have the back-bones had a single
lappet.<a id="r367"></a><a href="#f367" class="c011"><sup>[367]</sup></a> However I will bear thee to Baghdad where I will stablish
thee in a spacious and well furnished lodging with ten slave girls
and eunuchs to serve thee; and, as long as thou abide with me, I
will give thee<a id="r368"></a><a href="#f368" class="c011"><sup>[368]</sup></a> every day five golden ducats and every month a
suit of sumptuous clothes. Moreover everything in thy lodging
shall be thine; and whatever gifts and offerings be made to thee
they shall be thy property, for the folk will fancy thee to be my
bride and will entertain thee and escort thee to the Hammams and
present thee with sumptuous dresses. After this fashion thou shalt
pass thy days in joyance and thou shalt abide with me in highmost
honour and esteem and worship till what time we see that can be
done. So from this moment forth<a id="r369"></a><a href="#f369" class="c011"><sup>[369]</sup></a> throw away all fear and hereafter
be happy in heart and high in spirits, for that now thou standest
me in stead of mother and sister and here naught shall befal thee
save weal. And now my first desire to thee which burned in my
soul hath been quenched and exchanged for brotherly love yet
<span class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>stronger than what forewent it.” So Attaf’s wife rejoiced with
exceeding joy; and, as they pursued their journey, Ja’afar ceased
not to clothe her in the finest of clothes, so that men might honour
her as the Wazir’s Consort; and ever to entreat her with yet
increasing deference. This endured until they entered Baghdad-city
where the attendants bore her Takhtrawán into the Minister’s
Harem and an apartment was set apart for her even as he had
promised, and she was provided with a monthly allowance of a
thousand dinars and all the comforts and conveniences and
pleasures whereof he had bespoken her; nor did he ever allow his
olden flame for her to flare up again, and he never went near
her; but sent messengers to promise her a speedy reunion with
her mate. Such was the case of Ja’afar and Attaf’s wife; and
now give ear to what befel and betided the Minister during his
first reception by his liege lord who had sorely regretted his
departure and was desolated by the loss of him. As soon as he
presented himself before the Caliph, who rejoiced with exceeding
joy and returned his salute and his deprecation of evil,<a id="r370"></a><a href="#f370" class="c011"><sup>[370]</sup></a> the Commander
of the Faithful asked him, “Where was the bourne of this
thy wayfare?” and he answered, “Damascus.” “And where didst
alight?” “In the house of one Attaf hight,” rejoined Ja’afar,
who recounted all that his host had done with him from the
beginning to the end. The Prince of True Believers took patience,
until he had told his story and then cried to his Treasurer
saying, “Hie thee hence and open the Treasury and bring me forth
a certain book.” And when this was done he continued, “Hand
that volume to Ja’afar.” Now when the Minister took it and read
it he found written therein all that had occurred between Attaf
and himself and he left not reading till he came to the time when
the twain, host and guest, had parted and each had farewelled other
and Attaf had fared homewards. Hereupon the Caliph cried to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>him, “Close the book at what place it completeth the recital of
thy bidding adieu to Attaf and of his returning to his own place,
so shalt thou understand how it was I said to thee:—Near me not
until thou bring that which is contained in this volume.” Then the
Commander of the Faithful restored the book to the Treasurer
saying, “Take this and set it in the bibliotheca;” then, turning to
Ja’afar he observed, “Verily Almighty Allah (be He glorified
and magnified!) hath deigned show thee whatso I read therein
until I fell a-weeping and a-laughing at one and the same time.
So now do thou retire and hie thee home.” Ja’afar did his
bidding and reassumed the office of Wazir after fairer fashion
than he was before. And now return we to the purport of our
story as regardeth the designs of Attaf and what befel him when
they took him out of gaol. They at once led him to the Kazi
who began by questioning him, saying, “Woe to thee, didst thou
murther this Háshimí?”<a id="r371"></a><a href="#f371" class="c011"><sup>[371]</sup></a> Replied he, “Yes, I did!” “And
why killedst thou him?” “I found him in yonder ruin and, I
struck him advisedly and slew him!” “Art thou in thy right
senses?” “Yea, verily.” “What may be thy name?” “I am
hight Attaf.” Now when the Judge heard this confession, which
was thrice repeated, he wrote a writ to the Mufti and acquainted
him with the contention: and the divine after delivering his
decision produced a book and therein indited the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span></i>.
Then he sent notice thereof to Ja’afar the Wazir for official order
to carry out the sentence and the Minister took the document and
affixing his seal and signature thereto gave order for the execution.
So they bore Attaf away and led him to the gallows-foot whither
he was followed by a world of folk in number as the dust; and,
as they set him under the tree Ja’afar the Wazir, who was riding
by with his suite at the time, suddenly espied a crowd going forth
the city. Thereupon he summoned the Sobáshí<a id="r372"></a><a href="#f372" class="c011"><sup>[372]</sup></a> who came up to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>him and kissed his knee. “What is the object of this gathering
of folk who be manifold as the dust and what do they want?”
quoth the Wazir; and quoth the officer, “We are wending to hang<a id="r373"></a><a href="#f373" class="c011"><sup>[373]</sup></a>
a Syrian who hath murthered a youth of Sharif family.” “And
who may be this Syrian?” asked the Wazir, and the other
answered, “One hight Attaf.” But when Ja’afar heard the word
Attaf he cried out with a mighty loud outcry and said, “Hither
with him.” So after loosing the noose from his neck they set him
before the Wazir who regarding him at once recognised his
whilome host albeit he was in the meanest of conditions, so he
sprang up and threw himself upon him and he in turn threw himself
upon his sometime guest.<a id="r374"></a><a href="#f374" class="c011"><sup>[374]</sup></a> “What condition be this?” quoth
Ja’afar as soon as he could speak, and quoth Attaf, “This cometh
of my acquaintance with thee which hath brought me to such
pass.” Hereupon the twain swooned clean away and fell down
fainting on the floor, and when they came to themselves and could
rise to their feet Ja’afar the Wazir sent his friend Attaf to the
Hammam with a sumptuous suit of clothes which he donned as he
came out. Then the attendants led him to the Wazirial mansion
where both took seat and they drank wine and ate the early meal<a id="r375"></a><a href="#f375" class="c011"><sup>[375]</sup></a>
and after their coffee they sat together in converse. And when
they had rested and were cheered, Ja’afar said, “Do thou acquaint
me with all that betided thee from the time we took leave each of
other until this day and date.” So Attaf fell to telling him how
he had been entreated by Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, Governor of
Syria; how he had been thrown into prison and how his enemy
came thither by night with intent to strangle him; also how the
gaoler devised a device to save him from slaughter and how he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>had fled nor ceased flight till he drew near Baghdad when
robbers had stripped him; how he had lost an opportunity of
seeing the Wazir because the city had been decorated; and,
lastly, what had happened to him through being driven from the
Cathedral-mosque; brief, he recounted all from commencement to
conclusion. Hereupon the Minister loaded him with benefits and
presently gave orders to renew the marriage-ceremony between
man and wife; and she seeing her husband led in to pay her the
first visit lost her senses, and her wits flew from her head and she
cried aloud, “Would Heaven I wot if this be on wake or the
imbroglio of dreams!” So she started like one frightened and a
moment after she threw herself upon her husband and cried, “Say
me, do I view thee in vision or really in the flesh?” whereto he
replied, “In the world of sense and no sweven is this.” Then he
took seat beside her and related to her all that had befallen him of
hardships and horrors till he was taken from under the Hairibee;
and she on her part recounted how she had dwelt under Ja’afar’s
roof, eating well and drinking well and dressing well and in
honour and worship the highmost that might be. And the joy
of this couple on reunion was perfect. But as for Ja’afar when the
morning morrowed, he arose and fared for the Palace; then,
entering the presence, he narrated to the Caliph all that had
befallen Attaf, art and part; and the Commander of the Faithful
rejoined, “Indeed this adventure is the most wondrous that can
be, and the most marvellous that ever came to pass.” Presently
he called to the Treasurer and bade him bring the book a second
time from the Treasury, and when it was brought the Prince of
True Believers took it, and handing it to Ja’afar, said to him, “Open
and read.” So he perused the whole tale of Attaf with himself
the while his liege lord again wept and laughed at the same
moment and said, “In very deed, all things strange and rare are
written and laid up amongst the treasuries of the Kings; and
therefor I cried at thee in my wrath and forbade thee my presence
<span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>until thou couldst answer the question, What is there in this
volume? and thou couldst comprehend the cause of my tears and
my smiles. Then thou wentest from before me and wast driven
by doom of Destiny until befel thee with Attaf that which did
befal; and in fine thou returnedst with the reply I required.” Then
the Caliph enrobed Ja’afar with a sumptuous honour-robe and
said to the attendants, “Bring hither to me Attaf.” So they went
out and brought him before the Prince of True Believers; and the
Syrian standing between his hands blessed the Sovran and prayed
for his honour and glory in permanence of prosperity and felicity.
Hereat quoth the Caliph, “O Attaf, ask whatso thou wishest!”
and quoth the generous man, “O King of the Age, I pray only
thy pardon for Abd al-Malik bin Marwan.” “For that he harmed
thee?” asked Harun al-Rashid, and Attaf answered, “O my lord,
the transgression came not from him, but from Him who caused
him work my wrong; and I have freely pardoned him. Also do
thou, O my lord, write a Farmán with thine own hand certifying
that I have sold to the gaoler, and have received from him
the price thereof, all my slaves and estates in fullest tale and
most complete. Moreover deign thou appoint him inspector over
the Governor of Syria<a id="r376"></a><a href="#f376" class="c011"><sup>[376]</sup></a> and forward to him a signet-ring by way
of sign that no petition which doth not bear that seal shall be
accepted or even shall be heard and lastly transmit all this with
a Chamberlain unto Damascus.” Now all the citizens of Syria
were expecting some ill-turn from the part of Attaf, and with this
grievous thought they were engrossed, when suddenly tidings from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>Baghdad were bruited abroad; to wit, that a Kapuji was coming
on Attaf’s business. Hereat the folk feared with exceeding great
affright and fell to saying, “Gone is the head of Abd al-Malik bin
Marwan, and gone all who could say aught in his defence.” And
when the arrival of the Chamberlain was announced all fared
forth to meet and greet him, and he entered on a day of flocking
and crowding,<a id="r377"></a><a href="#f377" class="c011"><sup>[377]</sup></a> which might be truly numbered amongst the days
and lives of men. And presently he produced the writ of
indemnity, and pardon may not be procured save by one duly
empowered to pardon. Then he sent for the gaoler and committed
to him the goods and chattels of Attaf, together with the signet
and the appointment of supervisor over the Governor of Syria with
an especial Farman that no order be valid unless sealed with the
superior’s seal. Nor was Abd al-Malik bin Marwan less rejoiced
that the adventure had ended so well for him when he saw the
Kapuji returning Baghdad-wards that he might report all concerning
his mission. But as for Attaf, his friend Ja’afar bestowed
upon him seigniories and presented him with
property and moneys exceeding tenfold
what he had whilome owned
and made him more
prosperous than he
had ever
been aforetime.</p>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>NOTE ON THE TALE OF ATTAF.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">Mr. Alexander J. Cotheal, of New York, a correspondent who already on
sundry occasions has rendered me able aid and advice, was kind enough to send
me his copy of the Tale of Attaf (the “C. MS.” of the foregoing pages). It
is a small 4to of pp. 334, size 5¾ by 8 inches, with many of the leaves injured and
repaired; and written in a variety of handwritings, here a mere scribble, there
regular and legible as printed Arabic. A fly-leaf inserted into the Arabic binding
contains in cursive hand the title, “A Book embracing many Tales of the Tales of
the Kings and named ‘Stories from the Thousand Nights and a Night.’” And
a note at the end supplies the date; “And the finish thereof was on Fifth Day
(Thursday), 9th from the beginning of the auspicious month Rabí’a 2nd, in the
year 1096 of the Hijrah of the Apostle, upon whom be the choicest of blessings
and the fullest of greetings; and Allah prospereth what he pleaseth,<a id="r378"></a><a href="#f378" class="c011"><sup>[378]</sup></a> and
praise be to God the One.” Thus (A.H. 1096 = A.D. 1685) the volume is upwards
of 200 years old. It was bought by Mr. Cotheal many years ago with
other matters among the effects of a deceased American missionary who had
brought it from Syria.</p>

<p class="c000">The “Tale of Attaf” occupies pp. 10–50, and the end is abrupt. The treatment
of the “Novel” contrasts curiously with that of the Chavis MS. which
forms my text, and whose directness and simplicity give it a European and
even classical character. It is an excellent study of the liberties allowed to
themselves by Eastern editors and scribes. In the Cotheal MS. the tone is
distinctly literary, abounding in verse (sometimes repeated from other portions
of The Nights), and in Saj’a or Cadence which the copyist sometimes denotes
by marks in red ink. The wife of Attaf is a much sterner and more important
personage than in my text: she throws water upon her admirer as he gazes
upon her from the street, and when compelled to marry him by her father, she
“gives him a bit of her mind” as forcibly and stingingly as if she were of
“Anglo-Saxon” blood; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> “An thou have in thee aught of manliness and
generosity thou wilt divorce me even as he did.” Sundry episodes like that of
the brutal Eunuch at Ja’afar’s door, and the Vagabond in the Mosque are also
introduced; but upon this point I need say no more, as Mr. Cotheal shall now
speak for himself.</p>

    <div><b>In the name of God, the Merciful, the Compassionate to whom we cry for help.</b></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">They say God is omniscient, knowing the past and the future, and we learn from
the histories of the peoples that there was in ancient times and bygone seasons
(and God knows best!) a Caliph of the Caliphs of the orthodox and he was
Harun er-Rashid who one night became very restless and from the drowsiness
that came upon him he sat down upon the bed and dressed himself in sleeping-clothes;
then it was that he called to his service Mesrúr the sword-bearer of
grace who came immediately into his presence and said to him, O Mesrur, the
night is very oppressive and I wish thee to dispel my uneasiness. Then Mesrur
said to him, O Commander of the Faithful, arise now and go to the terrace-roof
of the palace and look upon the canopy of heaven and upon the twinkling
stars and the brightness of the moon, while listening to the music of the
rippling streams and the creaking norias as they are spoken of by the poet
who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A Noria that discharges by the spouts of her tears resembles the actions of a distracted lover:</div>
      <div class="line">She is the lover of her branches (sweeps or levers) by the magic in her heart until she laughs:</div>
      <div class="line">She complains and the tears run from her eyes, she rises in the morning to find herself weeping and complaining.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c013"><span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>Then he said, O Commander of the Faithful, the <em>streams</em> also are thus mentioned
by one of them:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My favorite is a damsel dispensing drink, and my recreation is a running stream;</div>
      <div class="line">A damsel whose eyes are a garden of Paradise, and a garden whose springs make a running brook.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then again said Harun er-Rashid, O Mesrur, such is not my wish, and Mesrur
replied, O Commander of the Faithful, in thy palace are three hundred and
sixty damsels, they are thy concubines and thy slaves, and they are as if they
were rising moons and beautiful gazelles, and in elegant robes they are dressed
like the flowers. Walk around in the midst of the palaces and from thy hiding-place
see each of them enter by herself in her own apartment admiring her
beauty and her magnificent dresses, all showing their joy and mirth since they
will not know of thee; then listen to their singing and their playing and their
joyous company in their apartments and perhaps you’ll attach yourself to one
of them who’ll play with thee, keep thee awake and be thy cup-companion,
dispelling what may remain of thy restlessness. But he replied, O Mesrur, bring
to me my cousin Ja’afar the Barmeky immediately. So he answered, Hearing
is obedience. Then Mesrur went out to the house of Ja’afar and said to him,
Come to the Commander of the Faithful, and he answered, To hear is to
obey. Then Ja’afar dressed himself and went with Mesrur to the Caliph and
kissing the ground before him he said, May it be good! O Commander of the
Faithful. It is not other than good, he answered, but I am wearied this night
with a great weariness and I sent for you to divert me so that my unrest may
be dissipated. Then Ja’afar said, Let’s get up, O Commander of the Faithful,
and we’ll go out into the garden of the palace and listen to the warbling of
the birds and smell of the odours of the flowers, and the cool zephyr with its
gentle breath will pass over us, dispelling our uneasiness and gladdening
the heart. The Rawi says that Ja’afar was very familiar with the Caliph by
reason of the endearment between them. Then the Caliph arose and with
Ja’afar and Mesrur went to the garden. The Caliph began to be thoughtful
and asked about the trees and the qualities of the flowers and the fruits and the
nature of their colours, and as the Caliph took pleasure in that, he walked around
for an hour and then passed over to the palaces and houses, going from place to
place, from quarter to quarter, and from market to market; and, whilst they
were going on, they stopped before a book-shop and the Caliph opened a
book-case and began to turn over the books one by one, and taking one in his
hand opened it, began to read in it, and then suddenly laughed until he fell upon
his back. He read in it again and wept until his beard was wet with the falling
tears, and wrapping up the book he put it in his sleeve when Ja’afar said, O
Commander of the Faithful and Lord of the two worlds, what was it that made
thee laugh and then weep at the same time? When the Caliph heard that
he was angered and cried out at him in the midst of his rage, O dog of a
Barmeky, what an impertinence on thy part about what concerns thee not,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>why meddle with what thou hast not lost. You’ve taken upon yourself to be
annoying and conceited, you have passed beyond your place and it only
remained for you to brave the Caliph. By my fathers and grandfathers, if
thou dost not bring me someone who can tell me about the contents of this
book from the first page to the last, I’ll strike thy neck and show thee what it
is that has made me laugh and cry. When Ja’afar heard these words and
saw his passion he said, O Commander of the Faithful, I have committed a
fault: sin is for the like of me and forgiveness for the like of your Highness;
to which the Caliph answered, I have made oath, thou must bring that person
to explain the book or I’ll strike thy neck this very hour. Then Ja’afar said, O
Commander of the Faithful, God created the heavens and the two worlds in six
days and if it had pleased Him He could have created them in one single hour,
but He did so for an instruction to his worshippers that one should not fault
with another but be patient; then, O Lord, be thou patient with thy servant if
it be for three days only; and the Caliph replied to him, If thou bringest not
to me him whom I have mentioned I will slay thee with the most horrible of
deaths. At this Ja’afar said, I depart on thy mission; thereupon Ja’afar went
home with a sorrowful heart to his father Yahya and his brother El-Fadl to
take leave of them and weep. Then they said to him, What is thy trouble? so
he told them of what had occurred between him and the Caliph and of the
condition laid upon him of execution if not complied with in three days, for
doubtless the Caliph seeks my death; he who strikes against a point, ’twill
pierce his hand, and he that struggles with a lion will be killed; but as to
myself I can no longer remain with him for that would be the greatest of
dangers for me and for thee, O my father, and for thee, O my brother. I now
set out to travel and I wish to go far away from his eye. The preservation of
life is not esteemed and is of little value: distance is the best preservative for
our necks—as is said by the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Save your life if menaced by evil (danger), and leave the house to complain of the builder:</div>
      <div class="line">You’ll find a land upon a land, but not another life for your own life.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When he had finished, his father and his brother said to him, Do not do so,
for probably the Caliph will be merciful to you. And Ja’afar answered, Only
good will come of my travel. Then he went to his treasure-room and took out
a purse containing 1,000 dinars, mounted his horse, put on his sword, bade
adieu to his father and brother and set forth in his time and hour; then, not
taking with him any servants, either slave or boy, he hastened on his journey,
travelling day and night for twenty days until he reached the city of Aleppo
without stopping, passing by Hamah and Homs until he reached Teniyát al-Igáb
and arrived at Damascus where he entered the city and saw the Minaret
of the Bride from bottom to top covered with gilded tiles; and it surrounded
with meadows, irrigated gardens with all kinds of flowers, fields of myrtle with
mountains of violets and other beauties of the gardens. He dwelt upon these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_202">202</span>charms while listening to the singing of the birds in the trees; and he saw a
city whose like has never been created in any other country of the world.
Turning then to the right hand and to the left he espied a man standing near
him and said to him, O my brother, what’s the name of this city? and he
answered, O my lord, this city in ancient times was called Jullag the same that
is mentioned by the poet who says:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I am called Jullag and my heart I attach, in me flow the waters, in and out;</div>
      <div class="line">The Garden of Eden upon the earth, birth-place of the fairies:</div>
      <div class="line">I will never forget thy beauties, O Damascus, for none but thee will I ever long:—</div>
      <div class="line">Blessed be the wonders that glitter on thy roofs (expanse).</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She was also called <em>Sham</em> (grain of beauty) because she is the Sham of
Cities and the Sham of God on earth. Ja’afar was pleased at the explanation
of the name, and dismounted with the intention of taking a stroll through the
streets, by the great houses and the domes (mosks). Whilst thus engaged in
examining the various places and their beauties, he perceived a tent of silk
brocade called Dibáj, containing carpets, furniture, cushions, silk curtains,
chairs and beds. A young man was sitting upon a mattress, and he was like a
rising moon, like the shining orb in its fourteenth night. He was in an
undress, upon his head a kerchief and on his body a rose-coloured gaberdine;
and as he sat before him were a company and drinks worthy of Kings. Ja’afar
stopped and began to contemplate the scene, and was pleased with what he
saw of the youth; then looking further he espied a damsel like unto the sun
in serene firmament who took her lute and played on it while singing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Evil to whoever have their heart in possession of their lovers, for in obtaining it they will kill it:</div>
      <div class="line">They have abandoned it when they have seen it amorous: when they see it amorous they abandon it.</div>
      <div class="line">Nursling, they pluck it out from the very entrails: O bird, repeat “Nursling they have plucked thee out!”</div>
      <div class="line">They have killed it unjustly: the loved plays the coquette with the humble lover.</div>
      <div class="line">The seeker of the effects of love, love am I, brother of love, and sigh</div>
      <div class="line">Behold the man stricken by love, though his heart change not they bury it (him?)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Rawi said that Ja’afar was pleased and he rejoiced at hearing the song
and all his organs were moved at the voice of the damsel and he said, Wallahy,
it is fine. Then she began again to sing, reciting the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">With these sentiments thou art in love, it is not wonderful that I should love thee:</div>
      <div class="line">I stretch out my hand to thee asking for mercy and pity for my humility—mayst thou be charitable;</div>
      <div class="line">My life has passed away soliciting thy consent, but I have not found it in my confidence to be charitable,</div>
      <div class="line">And I have become a slave in consequence of her possession of love my heart is imprisoned and my tears flow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>When the poem was finished Ja’afar gave himself up more and more to the
pleasure of hearing and looking at the damsel. The youth, who was reclining,
sat up and calling some of his boys said to them, Don’t you see that young
man standing there in front of us? They answered, Yes, and he said, He must
be a stranger for I see on him the signs of travel: bring him to me and take
care not to offend him. They answered, With joy and gladness, and went
towards Ja’afar, who, while contemplating the damsel, perceived the boy that
came and who said to him, In the name of God, O my lord, please have the
generosity to come in to our master. Ja’afar came with the boy to the door of
the tent, dismounted from his horse and entered at the moment when the youth
was rising upon his feet, and he stretched out his two hands and saluted him
as if he had always known him, and after he had chanted the prayer to the
envoy (of Allah) he sang:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O my visitor be welcome, thou enlivenest us and bringest us our union:</div>
      <div class="line">By thy face I live when it appears and I die if it disappears.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he said to Ja’afar, Please be seated, my dear sir; thanks be to God
for your happy arrival; and he continued his chant after another prayer to
the envoy (of God):—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If we had known of thy arrival we would have covered (thy) heart with the black of our eyes,</div>
      <div class="line">And we would have spread the street with our cheeks that thy coming might have been between our eyelids.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">After that he arose, kissed the breast of Ja’afar, magnified his power and
said to him, O my Master, this day is a happy one and were it not a fast-day I
would have fasted for thee to render thanks to God. Then came up the
servants to whom he said, Bring us what is ready. They spread the table of
viands and the youth said, O my lord, the Sages say, ‘If you are invited content
yourself with what’s before you, but if you are not invited, stay not and visit
not again; if we had known that you would arrive to-day we would have
sacrificed the flesh of our bodies and our children.’ Ja’afar said, I put out my
hand and I ate until I was satisfied, while he was presenting me with his hand
the delicate morsels and taking pleasure in entertaining me. When we had
finished they brought the ewer and basin, we washed our hands and we passed
into the drinking room where he told the damsel to sing. She took up her
lute, tuned it, and holding it against her breast she began:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A visitor of whom the sight is venerated by all, sweeter than either spirit or hope:</div>
      <div class="line">He spreads the darkness of his hair over the morning dawn and the dawn of shame appeared not;</div>
      <div class="line">And when my lot would kill me I asked his protection, his arrival revived a soul that death reclaimed:</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve become the slave of the Prince of the Lovers and the dominion of love was of my making.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>The Rawi says that Ja’afar was moved with exceeding joy, as was also the
youth, but he did not fail to be fearful on account of his affair with the Caliph,
so that it showed itself in his countenance, and this anxiety was apparent to the
youth who knew that he was anxious, frightened, dreaming and uncertain.
Ja’afar perceived that the youth was ashamed to question him on his position
and the cause of his condition, but the youth said to him, O my lord, listen to
what the Sages have said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Worry not thyself for things that are to come, drive away your cares by the intoxicating bowl:</div>
      <div class="line">See you not that hands have painted beautiful flowers on the robes of drink?</div>
      <div class="line">Spoils of the vine-branch, lilies and narcissus, and the violet and the striped flower of N’uman:</div>
      <div class="line">If troubles overtake you, lull them to sleep with liquors and flowers and favourites.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then said he to Ja’afar, Contract not thy breast, and to the damsel, Sing;
and she sang, and Ja’afar who was delighted with her songs, said Let us not
cease our enjoyment, now in conversation, now in song until the day closes and
night comes with darkness.</p>

<p class="c000">The youth ordered the servants to bring up the horses and they presented to
his guest a mare fit for Kings. We mounted (said Ja’afar), and, entering
Damascus, I proceeded to look at the bazars and the streets until we came to
a large square in the middle of which were two mastabas or stone benches
before a high doorway brilliantly illuminated with divers lights, and before a
portière was suspended a lamp by a golden chain. There were lofty domes
surrounded by beautiful statues, and containing various kinds of birds and
abundance of flowing water, and in their midst was a hall with windows of
silver. He opened it and found it looking upon a garden like that of Paradise
animated by the songs of the birds and the perfumes of the flowers and the
ripple of the brooks. The house, wherein were fountains and birds warbling
their songs understood in every language, was carpeted with silken rugs and
furnished with cushions of Dibaj-brocade. It contained also in great number
costly articles of every kind, it was perfumed with the odours of flowers and
fruits and it contained every other imaginable thing, plates and dishes of
silver and gold, drinking vessels, and a censer for ambergris, powder of aloes
and every sort of dried fruits. Brief, it was a house like that described by the
poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Society became perfectly brilliant in its beauty and shone in the éclat of its magnificence.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Ja’afar said, When I sat down the youth came to me and asked, From what
country art thou? I replied, From Basora, soldier by profession, commandant
over a company of men and I used to pay a quit-rent to the Caliph. I became
afraid of him for my life and I came away fleeing with downcast face for dread
of him, and I never ceased wandering about the country and in the deserts
until Destiny has brought me to thee. The youth said, A blessed arrival, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_205">205</span>what may be thy name? I replied, My name is like thine own. On hearing
my words he smiled, and said, laughing, O my Lord, Abu ’l-Hasan, carry no
trouble in your heart nor contraction of your breast; then he ordered a service
and they set for us a table with all kinds of delicacies and we ate until satisfied.
After this they took away the table and brought again the ewer and basin and
we washed our hands and then went to the drinking room where there was a
pleasaunce filled with fruits and flowers in perfection. Then he spoke to the
damsel for music and she sang, enchanting both Ja’afar and the youth with
delight at her performances, and the place itself was agitated, and Ja’afar
in the excess of his joy took off his robes and tore them. Then the youth said
to him, Wallahy, may the tearing be the effect of the pleasure and not of
sorrow and waywardness, and may God disperse far from you the bitterness
of your enemies. Then he went to a chest (continued Ja’afar) and took out
from it a complete dress, worth a hundred dinars and putting it upon me said
to the damsel, Change the tune of thy lute. She did so, and sang the following
verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My jealous regard is attached to him and if he regard another I am impatient:</div>
      <div class="line">I terminate my demand and my song crying, Thy friendship will last until death in my heart.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Rawi said: When she had finished her poetry Ja’afar threw off the last
dress and cried out, and the youth said, May God ameliorate your life and make
its beginning the end. Then he went to the chest and took out a dress better
than the first and put it upon Ja’afar, and the damsel was silent for an hour
during the conversation. The youth said, Listen, O my lord Abu ’l-Hasan, to
what people of merit have said of this valley formerly called the Valley of
Rabwat in which we now are and spoken of in the poem, saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O bounty of our Night in the valley of Rabwat where the gentle zephyr brings in her perfumes:</div>
      <div class="line">It is a valley whose beauty is like that of the necklace: trees and flowers encompass it.</div>
      <div class="line">Its fields are carpeted with every variety of flowers and the birds fly around above them;</div>
      <div class="line">When the trees saw us seated beneath them they dropped upon us their fruits.</div>
      <div class="line">We continued to exchange upon the borders of its gardens the flowing bowls of conversation and of poesy,</div>
      <div class="line">The valley was bountiful and her zephyrs brought to us what the flowers had sent to us.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So when the youth had finished his recitation he turned to the damsel and
told her to sing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I consume (with desire) when I hear from him a discourse whose sweetness is a melting speech:</div>
      <div class="line">My heart palpitates when he sees it, it is not wonderful that the drunken one should dance:</div>
      <div class="line">It has on this earth become my portion, but on this earth I have no chance to obtain it.</div>
      <div class="line">O Lord! tell me the fault that I’ve committed, perhaps I may be able to correct it.</div>
      <div class="line">I find in thee a heart harder than that of others and the hearts consume my being.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>Now when she had finished, Ja’afar in his joy threw off the third dress.
The youth arose, kissed him on the head, and then took out for him another
suit and put it upon him, for he was the most generous man of his time. Then
he entertained Ja’afar with the news of the day and of the subjects and
anecdotes of the great pieces of poetry and said to him, O my lord, load not
thyself with cares. The Rawi says that they continued living in the same way
for forty days and on the forty-first Ja’afar said to the young man, Know, O my
lord, that I have left my country neither for eating nor for drinking, but to
divert myself and to see the world; but if God vouchsafe my return to my
country to talk to my people, my neighbours and friends, and they ask me
where I have been and what I have seen, I will tell them of your generosity
and of the great benefactions that you have heaped upon me in your country
of Damascus. I will say that I have sighted this and that, and thus I will
entertain them with what I have espied in Damascus and of its order. The
young man replied, Thou sayest true: and Ja’afar said, I desire to go out and
visit the city, its bazars and its streets, to which the young man answered,
With love and good will, to-morrow morning if it please Allah. That night
Ja’afar slept there and when God brought the day, he rose, went in to the
young man, wished him good morning and said to him, O my lord, thy
promise! to which he replied, With love and good will; and, ordering a white
dress for him, he handed him a purse of three hundred dinars saying, Bestow
this in charity and return quick after thou hast made thy visit, and lastly said
to his servants, Bring to your lord a horse to ride. But Ja’afar answered, I do
not wish to have one, for a rider cannot observe the people but the people
observe him. The young man, who was named Attaf, said, O my lord, be it as
thou wishest and desirest; be not away long on my account for thine absence
gives me pain. Then he gave to Ja’afar a grain of red musk saying, Take this
and keep it in thy hand and if thou go into any place where there is a bad
odour thou wilt take a smell of the musk. Ja’afar the Barmeky (Allah be
merciful to him!) said, After that I left him and set out to walk in the streets
and quarters of Damascus and went on until I came to the Mosk of the
’Omeyyades where I saw a fountain casting the water from its upper part and
falling like serpents in their flight. I sat down under the pulpit; and as it was
a Friday I heard the preacher and made my Friday prayer and remained
until I made the afternoon prayer when I went to distribute the money I had,
after which I recited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I see the beauties united in the mosk of Jullag, and around her the meaning of beauty is explained;</div>
      <div class="line">If people converse in the mosks tell them their entrance door is open.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then I left the mosk and began to promenade the quarters and the streets
until I came before a splendid house, broad in its richness and strong in its
build, having a border of gold astonishing the mind by the beauty of the work,
showing curtains of silk embroidered with gold and in front of the door were
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>two carpeted steps. I sat down upon one of them and began to think of
myself and of the events that had happened to me and of my ignorance of
what had taken place after my departure. In the midst of my sadness at the
contemplation of my troubles (and the wind blowing upon me) I fell asleep and
I awaked not until a sprinkling of water came down upon me. On opening
my eyes I saw a young woman behind the curtain dressed in a morning gown
and a <em>Sa’údí</em> fillet upon her forehead. Her look and eyelids were full of art
and her eyebrows were like the fronts of the wings of light. The Rawi says
she resembled a full moon. When my eyes fell upon her (continued Ja’afar)
and looked at her, that look brought with it a thousand sighs and I arose and
my disposition was changed. The young woman cried at me and I said, I am
your servant, O my lady, and here at thy command, but said she, No labbayka
and no favour for thee! Is this house thine? Said I, No my lady, and she
replied, O dog of the streets, this house is not thine, why art thou sitting here?
When Ja’afar heard this he was greatly mortified, but he took courage and
dissimulated, answering, O my lady, I am resting here only to recite some
verses which I have composed for thee, then she asked, And what hast thou
said about me? He continued:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She appeared in a whitish robe with eyelids and glances of wonder,</div>
      <div class="line">I said she came out without greeting, with her I’m content to my heart’s content.</div>
      <div class="line">Blessed be He that clothed thy cheeks with roses, He can create what He wills without hindrance.</div>
      <div class="line">Thy dress like thy lot is as my hand, white, and they are white upon white upon my white.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When he had finished these verses he said, I have composed others on thine
expression, and recited the following:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Dost thou see through her veil that face appearing how it shines, like the moon in the horizon?</div>
      <div class="line">Its splendour enlightens the shade of her temples and the sun enters into obscurity by system;</div>
      <div class="line">Her forehead eclipses the rose and the apple, and her look and expression enchant the people;</div>
      <div class="line">It is she that if mortal should see her he’d become victim of love, of the fires of desire.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">On hearing this recitation the young lady said to Ja’afar, Miserable fellow, what
is this discourse which does not belong to the like of thee? Get up and begone
with the malediction of Allah and the protection of Satan. Ja’afar arose, seized
with a mighty rage in addition to his love; and in this love for her he departed
and returned to the house of his friend Attaf and saluted him with a prepossessed
heart. As soon as Attaf saw him he cast himself on his breast and
kissed him between the eyes, saying to him, O my lord, thou hast made me
feel desolate to-day by thine absence. Then Attaf, looking in the face of
Ja’afar and reading in it many words, continued to him, O my lord, I find thy
countenance changed and thy mind broken. Ja’afar answered, O my lord,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>since I left thee up to the present time I have been suffering with a headache
and a nervous attack for I was sleeping upon my ear. The people in the mosk
recited the afternoon prayer without my knowing it, and now I have a mind to
get an hour’s sleep, probably I shall find repose for the body, and what I suffer
will pass off. Accordingly, Attaf went into the house and ordered cushions to
be brought out and a bed to be made for him, Ja’afar then stretched himself
upon it depressed and out of spirits, and covering himself up began to think of
the young lady and of the offensive words she gave him so contrary to usage.
Also he thought of her beauty and the elegance of her stature and perfect
proportions and of what Allah (to whom be praise!) had granted her of
magnificence. He forgot all that happened to him in other days and also his
affair with the Caliph and his people and his friends and his society. Such
was the burden of his thoughts until he was taken with monomania and his
body wasted. Hereupon Attaf sent for doctors, they surrounded him constantly,
they employed all their talents for him, but they could find no remedy.
So he remained during a certain time without anyone being able to discover
what was the matter with him. The breast of Attaf became straitened, he
renounced all diversions and pleasures, and Ja’afar getting worse and worse,
his trouble augmented. One day a new doctor arrived, a man of experience in
the art of gallantry, whose name was Dabdihkán. When he came to Ja’afar
and looked at his face and felt his pulse and found everything in its place, no
suffering, no pain, he comprehended that he was in love, so he took a paper
and wrote a prescription and placed it beneath Ja’afar’s head. He then said,
Thy remedy is under thy head, I’ve prescribed a purge, if thou take it thou wilt
get well, for he was ashamed to tell Attaf his love-sick condition. Presently
the Doctor went away to other patients and Attaf arose and when about
entering to see Ja’afar he heard him recite the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A doctor came to me one day and took my hand and pulse, when I said to him Let go my hand, the fire’s in my heart.</div>
      <div class="line">He said, Drink syrup of the rose and mix it well with water of the tongue but tell it not to anyone:</div>
      <div class="line">I said, The syrup of the rose is quite well known to me; it is the water of the cheek that breaks my very heart;</div>
      <div class="line">But can it be that I can get the water of the tongue that I may cool the burning fire that within me dwells?</div>
      <div class="line">The doctor said, Thou art in love, I said Yes to him, and said he to me, Its remedy is to have the body here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then when Attaf went in to him after the end of the recitation he sat down at
the head of the bed and asked him about his condition and what had been
prescribed for him by the Hakím. Ja’afar said, O my lord, he wrote for me a
paper which is under the pillow. Attaf put out his hand, took out the paper
and read it and found upon it written:—“In the name of God the Curer—To
be taken, with the aid and blessing of God, 3 miskals of pure presence of the
beloved unmixed with morsels of absence and fear of being watched: plus,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>3 miskals of a good meeting cleared of any grain of abandonment and rupture:
plus, 2 okes of pure friendship and discretion deprived of the wood of
separation. Then take some extract of the incense of the kiss, the teeth and
the waist, 2 miskals of each; also take 100 kisses of pomegranate rubbed and
rounded, of which 50 small ones are to be sugared, 30 pigeon-fashion and 20
after the fashion of little birds. Take of Aleppine twist and sigh of Al-Iráq
2 miskals each; also 2 okes of tongue-sucking, mouth and lip kissing, all to
be pounded and mixed. Then put upon a furnace 3 drams of Egyptian grain
with the addition of the beautiful fold of plumpness, boil it in love-water and
syrup of desire over a fire of wood of pleasure in the retreat of the ardour.
Decant the whole upon a royal díbáqy divan and add to it 2 okes of saliva
syrup and drink it fasting during 3 days. Next take for dinner the melon of
desire mixed with embrace-almond and juice of the lemon of concord, and
lastly 3 rolls of thigh-work and enter the bath for the benefit of your health.
And—The Peace!” When Attaf had finished the reading of this paper he burst
into a laugh at the prescription and, turning to Ja’afar, he asked him with
whom he was in love and of whom he was enamoured. Ja’afar gave no
answer, he spoke not neither did he commence any discourse, when Attaf said,
O my brother, thou are not my friend, but thou art in my house esteemed as
is the soul in the body. Between me and thee there has been for the last four
months friendship, company, companionship and conversation. Why then
conceal thy situation? For me, I have fear and sorrow on thine account.
Thou art a stranger, thou art not of this capital. I am a son of the city, I can
dispel what thou hast (of trouble) and that of which thou sufferest. By my
life, which belongs to you, by the bread and salt between us, reveal to me thy
secret. And Attaf did not cease to speak thus until Ja’afar yielded and said to
him, It shall no longer be concealed, and I will not blame those who are in love
and are impatient. Then he told his story from beginning to end, what was
said to him by the young lady and what she did with him and lastly he described
the quarter and the place. Now when Attaf heard the words of Ja’afar he
reflected on the description of the house and of the young lady and concluded
that the house was his house and the young lady was his cousin-wife, and said
to himself, There is no power nor strength but in Allah the High, the Great.
We are from God and to Him we return. Then he came to his mind again and
to the generosity of his soul and said to himself, O Attaf! God hath favoured
me and hath made me worthy of doing good and hath sent to me I know not
whence this stranger who hath become bound in friendship with me during all
this time and he hath acquired over me the ties of friendship. His heart hath
become attached to the young woman and his love for her hath reached in him
an imminent point. Since that time he is almost on the verge of annihilation,
in so pitiable a condition and behold, he hopeth from me a good issue from his
trouble. He hath made known to me his situation after having concealed it for
so long a time: if I do not befriend him in his misfortune I should resemble
him who would build upon water and thus would aid him to annihilate his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_210">210</span>existence. By the magnanimity of my God, I will further him with my
property and with my soul. I will divorce my cousin and will marry her to
him and I will not change my character, my generosity nor my resolution. The
Rawi says, that young woman was his wife and his cousin, also a second wife as
he was previously married to another, and she occupied the house, his own house
containing all that he possessed of property and so forth, servants, odalisques
and slaves. There was also his other house which was for his guests, for
drinking and eating and to receive his friends and his company. Of this,
however, he said nothing to his cousin-wife when he came to see her at certain
times. When he heard that Ja’afar was in love with her he could not keep
from saying to him, Be quiet, I take upon myself to dispel thy chagrin, and
soon I shall have news of her, and if she is the daughter of the Naïb of
Damascus I will take the proper steps for thee even though I should lose all
my property; and if she is a slave-girl I will buy her for thee even were her
price such as to take all I possess. Thus he calmed the anguish of Ja’afar the
best way he could; then he went out from his own house and entered that of
his cousin-wife without making any change in his habits or saying a single
word save to his servants, Go to my uncle’s and bring him to me. The boy
then went for the uncle and brought him to Attaf, and when the uncle entered
the nephew arose to receive him, embraced him and made him be seated, and,
after he had been seated awhile, Attaf came to him and said, O my uncle!
there is naught but good! Know that when God wills good to his servitor he
shows to him the way and my heart inclines to Meccah, to the house of God,
to visit the tomb of Mohammed (for whom be the most noble of prayers and
the most complete of salutations!) I have decided to visit those places this
year and I cannot leave behind me either attachments or debts or obligations;
nothing in fact that can disturb the mind, for no one can know who will be
the friend of the morrow. Here, then, is the writ of divorce of thy daughter
and of my other wife. Now when his uncle heard that, he was troubled and
exaggerating to himself the matter, he said, O son of my brother, what is it
that impels thee to this? If thou depart and leave her and be absent as long
as thou willest she is yet thy wife and thy dependent which is sufficient. But
Attaf said, O my uncle, what hath been done is done. As soon as the young
wife heard that, the abomination of desolation overcame her, she became
as one in mourning and was upon the point of killing herself, because she
loved her husband by reason of his relationship and his education. But this
was done by Attaf only to please Ja’afar, and for that he was incited by
his duty to do good to his fellow beings. Then Attaf left the house and
said to himself, if I delay this matter it will be bruited abroad, and will
come to the ears of my friend who will be afflicted and will be ashamed to
marry, and what I have done will come to naught. The divorce of Attaf’s
second spouse was only out of regard to his cousin-wife, and that there might
not be an impediment to the success of his project. Then Attaf proceeded to
his guest-house and went in to Ja’afar, who when he saw him, asked where he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_211">211</span>had been. Attaf replied, Make yourself easy, O my brother, I am now occupied
with your affair, I have sought out the young lady and I know her. She is
divorced from her husband and her ’iddah is not yet expired, so expand your
breast and gladden your soul, for when her obligatory term of waiting shall
be accomplished I will marry her to you. And Attaf ceased not to divert
him by eating and drinking, amusements and shows, song and songstress until
he knew that the ’iddah of his cousin had ended; then he went to Ja’afar and
said to him, “Know, O my lord, that the father of the young woman thou
sawest is one of my friends, and if I betroth her that would not be proper on
my part and he will say: My friend hath not done well in betrothing my
daughter to a man who is a stranger and whom I know not. He will take
her and carry her to his own country and we shall be separated. Now I
have an idea that has occurred to me, and ’tis to send out for you a tent with
ten mamelukes and four servants upon horses and mules, baggage, stuffs, chests
of dresses, and horses and gilded vehicles. Everything I have mentioned will
be placed outside the city that no one shall know of thee, and I will say that
thou art Ja’afar the Barmeky the Caliph’s Wazir. I will go to the Kady and
the Wali and the Naïb and I will inform them of thee (as Ja’afar); so will they
come out to meet and salute thee. Then thou wilt salute them and tell
them that thou hast come on business of the Caliph. Thou must also say thou
hast heard that Damascus is a very fine city and a hospitable, and add, I will
go in to visit it and if it prove favourable to me I will remain and marry to
establish between myself and its inhabitants relationship and friendship, and
I would like you to seek for me a man of high position and noble origin who
hath a beautiful cousin that I may marry. Attaf then said to Ja’afar, O my
lord, we know one who hath a daughter of noble origin, that man is such-and-such
an one, ask her of him for betrothal and say to him, Here is her dowry,
which is all that thou hast in the chests. Then produce a purse of a thousand
dinars and distribute them among those present, and display the characteristic
of the Barmekys, and take out a piece of silken stuff and order them to draw up
the marriage contract immediately. If they sign it, declare to them that thou
wilt not enter the city because thou art pressed and thy bride will come to thee.
Should thou do thus, thou wilt accomplish what thou desirest, God willing,
then leave instantly and order that the tents be struck, the camels loaded, and
set out for thine own country in peace. Know that all I shall do for you is
little for the rights of friendship and devotedness.” Ja’afar sprang up to kiss
the hand of Attaf, but was prevented, then he thanked him and praised him
and passed the night with him. The next morning at break of day he arose,
made his ablutions, and having recited his morning prayer, accompanied his
host to the outside of the city. Attaf ordered a great tent to be pitched and
that everything necessary should be carried to it; of horses, camels, mules,
slaves, mamelukes, chests containing all kinds of articles for distribution,
and boxes holding purses of gold and silver. He dressed his guest in a
robe worthy a Wazir, and set up for him a throne and sent some slaves to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_212">212</span>the Naïb of Damascus to announce the arrival of Ja’afar on business of the
Caliph. As soon as the Naïb of Damascus was informed of that, he went out
accompanied by the notables of the city and of his government and met the
Wazir Ja’afar, and kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, O my
lord, why didst thou not inform me sooner in order that we might be prepared
for thine arrival. Ja’afar said, That was not necessary, may God augment thy
wealth, I have not come but with the intention to visit this city; I desire to
stay in it for some time and I would also marry in it. I have learned that the
Amír ’Amr has a daughter of noble descent, I wish thou wouldst cause her to be
brought before thee and that thou betroth her to me. The Naïb of Damascus
said, Hearing is obeying. Her husband hath divorced her and desireth to go to
al-Hejaz on the pilgrimage and after her ’iddah hath expired and there remaineth
not any impediment the betrothal can take place. At the proper time the Naïb of
Damascus caused to be present the father of the lady and spoke to him of what
the Wazir Ja’afar had said and that he should betroth his daughter, so that
there was nothing more for the father to say than, I hear and I obey. The Rawi
says that Ja’afar ordered to be brought the dress of honour and the gold from the
purses to be thrown out for distribution and commanded the presence of the
Kady and witnesses; and, when they arrived, he bade them write the marriage
contract. Then he brought forward and presented the ten chests and the ten
purses of gold, the dowry of the bride, and all those present, high and low, and
rich and poor gave him their best wishes and congratulations. After the father
of the lady had taken the dowry he ordered the Kady to draw up the contract
and presented to him a piece of satin; he also called for sugar-water to drink
and set before them the table of viands, and they ate and washed their
hands. Afterwards they served sweet dishes and fruits; and when that
was finished and the contract passed, the Naïb of Damascus said to the Wazir,
O my lord, I will prepare a house for thy residence and for the reception of
thy wife. Ja’afar said, That cannot be; I am here on a commission of the
Commander of the Faithful, and I wish to take my wife with me to Baghdad and
only there can I have the bridal ceremonies. The father of the lady said, Enter
unto thy bride and depart when thou wilt. Ja’afar replied, I cannot do that,
but I wish thee to make up the trousseau of thy daughter and have it ready so
as to depart this very day. We only wait, said the father of the bride, for the
Naïb of Damascus to retire, to do what the Wazir commands. He answered
With love and good will; and the lady’s father set about getting together the
trousseau and making her ready. He took her out and got her trousseau,
mounted her upon a Hodaj, and when she arrived at Ja’afar’s camp her people
made their adieus and departed. When Ja’afar had ridden to some distance
from Damascus and had arrived at Tiniat el ’Iqáb he looked behind him and
perceived in the distance in the direction of Damascus a horseman galloping
towards him; so he stopped his attendants and when the rider had come near
them Ja’afar looked at him and behold it was Attaf. He had come out after
him and cried, Hasten not, O my brother. And when he came up he embraced
<span class="pageno" id="Page_213">213</span>him and said, O my lord, I have found no rest without thee, O my brother Abu
’l-Hasan, it would have been better for me never to have seen thee nor known
thee, for now I cannot support thine absence. Ja’afar thanked him and said to
him, I have not been able to act against what thou hast prescribed for me and
provided, but we pray God to bring near our reunion and never more separate us.
He is Almighty to do what He willeth. After that Ja’afar dismounted and spread
a silken carpet and they sat down together, and Attaf laid a tablecloth with duck,
chicken, sweets and other delicacies, of which they ate and he brought out dry
fruits and wine. They drank for an hour of the day when they remounted their
horses and Attaf accompanied Ja’afar a way on the journey, when Ja’afar
said to him, Every departer must return, and he pressed him to his breast and
kissed him and said to him, O my brother Abu ’l-Hasan, do not interrupt the
sending of thy letters; but make known to me about thyself, and thy condition
as if I were present with thee. Then they bade each other adieu and each
went on his way. When the young wife noticed that the camels had stopped
on their march as well as their people, she put out her head from the Hodaj
and saw her cousin dismounting with Ja’afar and they eating and drinking
together and then in company to the end of the road where they bade
adieu exchanging a recitation of poetry. So she said, The one, Wallahy
is my cousin Attaf and the other the man whom I saw seated under the
window, and upon whom I sprinkled the water. Doubtless he is the
friend of my cousin. He hath been seized with love for me, and complaining
to my cousin, hath given him a description of me and of my
house; and the devotedness of his character and the greatness of his soul
must have impelled him to divorce me and to take steps to marry me to that
man. The Rawi says that Attaf in bidding good-bye to Ja’afar left him joyful
in the possession of the young lady for whom he was on the point of ruin by
his love, and in having made the friendship of Attaf whom he intended to
reward in gratitude for what he had done by him. So glad was he to have
the young wife that everything that had taken place with Er-Rashid had passed
out of his mind. In the meanwhile she was crying and lamenting over what
had happened to her, her separation from her cousin and from her parents
and her country, and bemoaning what she did and what she had been; and
her scalding tears flowed while she recited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I weep for these places and these beauties; blame not the lover if some day he’s insane:</div>
      <div class="line">For the places the dear ones inhabit. O praise be to God! how sweet is their dwelling!</div>
      <div class="line">God protect the past days while with you, my dear friends, and in the same house may happiness join us!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">On finishing this recitation she wept and lamented and recited again:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I’m astonished at living without you at the troubles that come upon us:</div>
      <div class="line">I wish for you, dear absent ones, my wounded heart is still with you.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>Then, still crying and lamenting, she went on:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O you to whom I gave my soul, return; from you I wish’d to pluck it, but could not succeed:</div>
      <div class="line">Then pity the rest of a life that I’ve sacrificed for thee, before the hour of death my last look I will take:</div>
      <div class="line">If all of thee be lost astonished I’ll not be; my astonishment would be that his lot will be to another.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently the Wazir Ja’afar coming up to the Hodaj said to the young wife,
O mistress of the Hodaj, thou hast killed us. When she heard this address
she called to him with dejection and humility, We ought not to talk to thee for
I am the cousin-wife of thy friend and companion Attaf, prince of generosity
and devotion. If there be in thee any feeling of the self-denial of a man thou
wilt do for him that which, in his devotion, he hath done for thee. When
Ja’afar heard these words he became troubled and taking in the magnitude of
the situation he said to the young lady, O thou! thou art then his cousin-wife?
and said she, Yes! it is I whom thou sawest on such a day when this and that
took place and thy heart attached itself to me. Thou hast told him all that.
He divorced me, and while waiting for the expiration of my ’iddah diverted thee
that such and such was the cause of all my trouble. Now I have explained to
thee my situation: do thou the action of a man. When Ja’afar heard these
words he uttered a loud cry and said, We are from God and to Him we return.
O thou! thou art now to me an interdiction and hast become a sacred deposit
until thy return to where it may please thee. Then said Ja’afar to a servant,
Take good care of thy mistress. After which they set forward and travelled on
day and night. Now Er-Rashid, after the departure of Ja’afar, became uneasy
and sorrowful at his absence. He lost patience and was tormented with a great
desire to see him again, while he regretted the conditions he had imposed as
impossible to be complied with and obliging him to the extremity of tramping
about the country like a vagabond, and forcing him to abandon his native land.
He had sent envoys after him to search for him in every place, but he had
never received any news of him, and was cast into great embarrassment by
reason of his absence. He was always waiting to hear of him, and when Ja’afar
had approached Baghdad and he, Er-Rashid, had received the good tidings of
his coming, he went forth to meet him, and as soon as they came together they
embraced each other, and the Caliph became content and joyful. They entered
together into the palace and the Prince of True Believers seating Ja’afar at his
side, said to him, Relate to me thy story where thou hast been during thine
absence and what thou hast come upon. So Ja’afar told him then all that had
happened from the time he left him until the moment of finding himself between
his hands. Er-Rashid was greatly astonished and said, Wallahy, thou hast made
me sorrowful for thine absence, and hast inspired me with great desire to see
thy friend. My opinion is that thou divorce this young lady and put her on the
road homeward accompanied by someone in whom thou hast confidence. If
<span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>thy friend have an enemy he shall be our enemy, and if he have a friend he also
shall be ours; after which we will make him come to us, and we shall see him
and have the pleasure of hearing him and pass the time with him in joy. Such
a man must not be neglected, we shall learn, by his generosity, bounty and
useful things. Ja’afar answered, To hear is obedience. Then Ja’afar apportioned
to the young lady a spacious house and servants and a handsome
enclosure; and he treated with generosity those who had come with her as
suite and followers. He also sent to her sets of furniture, mattresses and every
thing else she might need, while he never intruded upon her and never saw her.
He sent her his salutation and reassuring words that she should be returned to
her cousin; and he made her a monthly allowance of a thousand dinars,
besides the cost of her living. So far as to Ja’afar; but as to Attaf, when he
had bidden adieu to Ja’afar and had returned to his country, those who were
jealous of him took steps to ruin him with the Naïb of Damascus to whom they
said, O our lord, what is it that hath made thee neglect Attaf? Dost thou not
know that the Wazir was his friend and that he went out after him to bid him
adieu after our people had returned, and accompanied him as far as Katifa, when
Ja’afar said to him, Hast thou need of anything O Attaf? he said <em>Yes</em>. Of
what? asked the Wazir, and he answered, That thou send me an imperial
rescript removing the Naïb of Damascus. Now this was promised to him, and
the most prudent thing is that thou invite him to breakfast before he takes you
to supper; success is in the opportunity and the assaulted profiteth by the
assaulter. The Naïb of Damascus replied, Thou hast spoken well, bring him to
me immediately. The Rawi says that Attaf was in his own house, ignorant
that anyone owed him grudge when suddenly in the night he was surrounded
and seized by the people of the Naïb of Damascus armed with swords and clubs.
They beat him until he was covered with blood, and they dragged him along
until they set him in presence of the Pasha of Damascus who ordered the pillage
of his house and of his slaves and his servants and all his property and they
took everything, his family and his domestics and his goods. Attaf asked, What
is my crime? and he was answered, O scoundrel, thou art an ignorant fellow of
the rabble, dost dispute with the Naïb of Damascus? Then the Swordman
was ordered to strike his neck, and the man came forward and, cutting off a
piece of his robe, with it blindfolded his eyes, and was about to strike his
neck when one of the Emírs arose and said, Be not hasty, O my lord, but wait,
for haste is the whisper of Satan, and the proverb saith: Man gaineth his ends
by patience, and error accompanieth the hasty man. Then he continued, Do
not press the matter of this man; perhaps he who hath spoken of him lieth
and there is nobody without jealousy; so have patience, for thou mayest have
to regret the taking of his life unjustly. Do not rest easy upon what may come
to thee on the part of the Wazir Ja’afar, and if he learn what thou hast done by
this man be not sure of thy life on his part. He will admit of no excuse for he
was his friend and companion. When the Naïb of Damascus heard that he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_216">216</span>awoke from his slumber and conformed to the words of the Emir. He ordered
that Attaf should be put in prison, enchained and with a padlock upon his neck,
and bade them, after severely tightening the bonds, illtreat him. They dragged
him out, listening neither to his prayers nor his supplications; and he cried
every night, doing penance to God and praying to Him for deliverance from his
affliction and his misfortune. In that condition he remained for three months.
But one night as he woke up he humiliated himself before God and walked
about his prison, where he saw no one; then, looking before him, he espied an
opening leading from the prison to the outside of the city. He tried himself
against his chain and succeeded in opening it; then, taking it from his neck,
he went out from the gaol running at full speed. He concealed himself in a
place, and darkness protected him until the opening of the city gate, when he
went out with the people and hastening his march he arrived at Aleppo and
entered the great mosk. There he saw a crowd of strangers on the point of
departure and Attaf asked them whither they were going, and they answered to
Baghdad. Whereupon he cried, And I with you. They said, Upon the earth
is our weight, but upon Allah is our nourishment. Then they went on their
march until they arrived at Koufa after a travel of twenty days, and then continued
journeying till they came to Baghdad. Here Attaf saw a city of strong
buildings, and very rich in elegant palaces reaching to the clouds, a city containing
the learned and the ignorant, and the poor and the rich, and the virtuous
and the evil doer. He entered the city in a miserable dress, rags upon his
shoulders, and upon his head a dirty conical cap, and his hair had become long
and hanging over his eyes and his entire condition was most wretched. He
entered one of the mosks. For two days he had not eaten. He sat down, when
a vagabond entered the mosk and seating himself in front of Attaf threw off
from his shoulder a bag from which he took out bread and a chicken, and
bread again and sweets and an orange, and olive and date-cake and cucumbers.
Attaf looked at the man and at his eating, which was as the table of ’Isa son
of Miriam (upon whom be peace!). For four months he had not had a
sufficient meal and he said to himself, I would like to have a mouthful of this
good cheer and a piece of this bread, and then cried for very hunger. The
fellow looked at him and said, Bravo! why dost thou squint and do what
strangers do? By the protection of God, if you weep tears enough to fill
the Jaxartes and the Bactrus and the Dajlah and the Euphrates and the
river of Basrah and the stream of Antioch and the Orontes and the Nile of
Egypt and the Salt Sea and the ebb and the flow of the Ocean, I will not let
thee taste a morsel. But, said the buffoon, if thou wish to eat of chicken and
white bread and lamb and sweets and mutton patties, go thou to the house
of Ja’afar son of Yahya the Barmeky, who hath received hospitality from a
Damascus man named Attaf. He bestoweth charity in honour of him in this
manner, and he neither getteth up nor sitteth down without speaking of him.
Now when Attaf heard these words from the buffoon he looked up to heaven
<span class="pageno" id="Page_217">217</span>and said, O Thou whose attributes are inscrutable, bestow thy benefits upon
thy servant Attaf. Then he recited this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Confide thy affairs to thy Creator; set aside thy pains and dismiss thy thoughts.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Attaf went to a paper-seller and got from him a piece of paper and
borrowed an inkstand and wrote as follows:—From thy brother Attaf whom
God knoweth. Let him who hath possessed the world not flatter himself, he
will some day be cast down and will lose it in his bitter fate. If thou see me
thou wilt not recognise me for my poverty and my misery; and, because of
the change in situation and the reverses of the times, my soul and body are
reduced by hunger, by the long journey I have made, until at last I have come
to thee. And peace be with thee. Then he folded the paper and returning
the pen-case to its owner asked for the house of Ja’afar, and when it was shown
to him he went there and stood at a distance before it. The doorkeepers saw
him standing, neither commencing nor repeating a word, and nobody spoke to
him, but as he was thus standing embarrassed, an eunuch dressed in a striped
robe and golden belt passed by him. Attaf remained motionless before
him, then went up to him, kissed his hands and said to him, O my lord, the
Apostle of Allah (upon whom be peace and salutation) hath said, The medium
of a good deed is like him who did it, and he who did it belongeth to the
dwellers in heaven. The man said to him, What is thy need? and said he, I
desire of thy goodness to send in this paper to thy lord and say to him, Thy
brother Attaf is standing at the door. When the servant heard his words he
got into a great and excessive rage so that his eyes swelled in his head and he
asked, O cursed one, thou art then the brother of the Wazir Ja’afar! and as
he had in his hand a rod with a golden end, he struck Attaf with it in the face
and his blood flowed and he fell full length to the ground in his weakness from
weeping and from receiving the blow. The Rawi says that God hath placed
the instinct of good in the heart of some domestics, even as he hath placed
that of evil in the heart of others. Another of the domestics was raised up
against his companion by good will to Attaf and reproved him for striking the
stranger and was answered, Didst thou not hear, O brother, that he pretended
to be the brother of the Wazir Ja’afar? and the second one said, O man of evil,
son of evil, slave of evil, O cursed one, O hog! is Ja’afar one of the prophets?
is he not a dog of the earth like ourselves? Men are all brethren, of one
father and one mother, of Adam and of Eve; and the poet hath said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Men by comparison all are brethren, their father is Adam their mother is Eve;</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">but certain people are preferable to others. Then he came up to Attaf and
made him be seated and wiped off the blood from his face and washed him
and shook off the dust that was upon him and said, O my brother, what is thy
need? and said he, My need is the sending of this paper to Ja’afar. The servant
took the paper from his hand and going in to Ja’afar the Barmeky found
<span class="pageno" id="Page_218">218</span>there the officers of the Governor and the Barmekys standing at his service on
his right and on his left; and Ja’afar the Wazir who held in his hand a cup of
wine was reciting poetry and playing and saying, O you all here assembled,
the absent from the eye is not like the present in the heart; he is my brother
and my friend and my benefactor, Attaf of Damascus, who was continuous in
his generosity and his bounty and his benefactions to me; who for me divorced
his cousin-wife and gave her to me. He made me presents of horses and
slaves and damsels and stuffs in quantities that I might furnish her dower;
and, if he had not acted thus, I should certainly have been ruined. He was
my benefactor without knowing who I was, and generous to me without any
idea of profiting by it. The Rawi says that when the good servant heard
these words from his lord he rejoiced and coming forward he kneeled down
before him and presented the paper. When Ja’afar read it he was in a state of
intoxication and not being able to discern what he was doing he fell on his face
to the floor while holding the paper and the glass in his hand, and he was
wounded in the forehead so his blood ran and he fainted and the paper fell
from his grasp. When the servant saw that he hastened to depart fearing the
consequence; and the Wazir Ja’afar’s friends seated their lord and staunched
the blood. They exclaimed, There is no power and strength but in God the
High, the Mighty. Such is the character of servants; they trouble the life of
kings in their pleasures and annoy them in their humours: Wallahy, the writer
of this paper merits nothing less than to be handed over to the Wali who
shall give him five hundred lashes and put him in prison. Thereupon the
Wazir’s doorkeeper went out and asked for the owner of the paper, when Attaf
answered, ’Tis I, O my lord. Then they seized him and sent him to the
Wali and ordered him to give one hundred blows of the stick to the prisoner
and to write upon his chain “for life.” Thus they did with Attaf and carried
him to the prison where he remained for two months when a child was born to
Harun er-Rashid, who then ordered that alms should be distributed, and good
done to all, and bade liberate all that were in prison and among those that were
set free was Attaf. When he found himself out of gaol, beaten and famished
and naked he looked up to heaven and exclaimed, Thanks be to thee, O Lord,
in every situation, and crying said, It must be for some fault committed by me
in the past, for God had taken me into favour and I have repaid Him in disobedience;
but I pray to Him for pardon for having gone too far in my
debauchery. Then he recited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O God! the worshipper doth what he should not do; he is poor, depending on Thee:</div>
      <div class="line">In the pleasures of life he forgetteth himself, in his ignorance, pardon Thou his faults.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he cried again and said to himself, What shall I do? If I set out for my
country I may not reach it; if I arrive there, there will be no safety for my
life on the part of the Naïb, and if I remain here nobody knoweth me among
the beggars and I cannot be for them of any use nor for myself as an aid or an
intermediate. As for me, I had hope in that man, that he would raise me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span>from my poverty. The affair hath turned out contrary to my expectations, and
the poet was right when he said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O friend, I’ve run o’er the world west and east; all that I met with was pain and fatigue:</div>
      <div class="line">I’ve frequented the men of the age, but never have found e’en a friend grateful not even to me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Once more he cried and exclaimed, God give me the grace of patience. After
that he got up and walked away, and entered one of the mosks and staid there
until afternoon. His hunger increased and he said, By Thy magnanimity and
Thy majesty I shall ask nothing of anyone but of Thee. He remained in the
mosk until it became dark when he went out for something, saying to himself,
I have heard a call from the Prophet (on whom be the blessing and peace of
Allah!) which said, God forbiddeth sleep in the Sanctuary and forbiddeth it to
His worshippers. Then he arose, and went out from the mosk to some distance
when he entered a ruined building after walking an hour, and here he stumbled
in the darkness and fell upon his face. He saw something before him that he
had struck with his foot and felt it move, and this was a lad that had been slain
and a knife was in his side. Attaf rose up from off the body, his clothes
stained with blood; he stood motionless and embarrassed and while in that
situation the Wali and his policemen stood at the door of the ruin and Attaf
said to them, Come in and search. They entered with their torches and found
the body of the murdered lad and the knife in him and the miserable Attaf
standing at the head with his clothes stained with blood. When a man with a
scarf saw him he arrested him and said to him, O Wretch, ’tis thou killedst
him. Attaf said, Yes. Then said the Wali, Pinion him and take him to prison
until we make our report to the Wazir Ja’afar. If he orders his death we will
execute him. They did as ordered, and the next day the man with the scarf
wrote to the Wazir, We went into a ruin and found there a man who had killed
a lad and we interrogated him and he confessed that it was he who had done
the deed, what are thine orders? The Wazir commanded them to put him to
death; so they took Attaf from the prison to the place of execution and cut
off a piece of his garment and with it bandaged his eyes. The Sworder said
O my lord, shall I strike his neck? and the Wali said, Strike! He brandished
the sword which whistled and glittered in the air and was about to strike,
when a cry from behind, Stop thy hand! was heard, and it was the voice of
the Wazir Ja’afar who was out on a promenade. The Wali went to him and
kissed the earth before him and the Wazir said to him, What is this great
gathering here? He answered, ’Tis the execution of a young man of Damascus
whom we found yesterday in a ruin; he had killed a lad of noble blood and we
found the knife with him and his clothes spotted with blood. When I said to
him, Is it thou that killedst him? he replied Yes three times. To-day I sent to
thee my written report and thine Excellency ordered his death, saying, “Let
the sentence of God be executed,” and now I have brought him out that his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>neck may be struck. Ja’afar said, “Oh, hath a man of Damascus come into
our country to find himself in a bad condition? Wallahy, that shall never be!”
Then he ordered that he should be brought to him. The Wazir did not
recognize him, for Attaf’s air of ease and comfort had disappeared; so Ja’afar
said to him, From what country art thou, O young man, and he answered,
I am a man from Damascus. From the city or from the villages? Wallahy
O my lord, from Damascus city where I was born. Ja’afar asked, Didst thou
happen to know there a man named Attaf? I know when thou wast his
friend and he lodged thee in such-and-such a house and thou wentest out to
such-and-such a garden; and I know when thou didst marry his cousin-wife,
I know when he bade adieu to thee at Katifa where thou drankest with him.
Ja’afar said, Yes, all that is true, but what became of him after he left me? He
said, O my Lord, there happened to him this and that and he related to him
everything from the time he quitted him up to the moment of his standing
before him and then recited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">This age, must it make me its victim, and thou at the same time art living: wolves are seeking to devour me while thou the lion art here.</div>
      <div class="line">Every thirsty one that cometh his thirst is quenched by thee: can it be that I thirst while thou art still our refuge?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When he had finished the verses he said, O my lord. I am Attaf, and then
recalled all that had taken place between them from first to last. While
he was thus speaking a great cry was heard, and it came from a Sheikh who
was saying, This is not humanity. They looked at the speaker, who was an
old man with trimmed beard dyed with henna, and upon him was a blue
kerchief. When Ja’afar saw him he asked him what was the matter, and he
exclaimed, Take away the young man from under the sword, for there is no
fault in him: he hath killed no one nor doth he know anything of the dead
youth. Nobody but myself is the killer. The Wazir said, Then ’tis thou that
killed him? and he answered, Yes.—Why didst thou kill him? hast thou not
the fear of God in killing a Hashimy child? The old man said, He was my
servant, serving me in the house and working with me at my trade. Every
day he took from me some quarter-pieces of money and went to work for
another man called Shumooshag, and to work with Nagísh, and with Gasís,
and with Ghúbar, and with Gushír, and every day working with someone.
They were jealous of my having him. ’Odís the sweeper and Abu Butrán
the stoker, and everyone wanted to have him. In vain I corrected him, but he
would not abide corrected and ceased not to do thus until I killed him in the
ruin, and I have delivered myself from the torment he gave me. That is my
story. I kept silent until I saw thee when I made myself known at the time
thou savedst the head of this young man from the sword. Here I am standing
before you: strike my neck and take life for life. Pray do no harm to
this young man, for he hath committed no fault. The Wazir said, Neither
<span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>to thee nor to him. Then he ordered to be brought the parents of the dead
lad and reconciled them with the old man, whom he pardoned. He mounted
Attaf upon a horse and took him to his house; then he entered the palace of
the Caliph and kissed the earth before him and said, Behold Attaf, he who was
my host at Damascus, and of whom I have related his treatment of me and his
kindness and generosity, and how he preferred me to himself. Er-Rashid said,
Bring him in to me immediately. He presented him to the Caliph in the
miserable state in which he had found him; and when he entered, he made
his salutations in the best manner and with the most eloquent language,
Er-Rashid answered and said to him, What is this state in which I find you?
and Attaf wept and made his complaint in these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Troubles, poverty and distant sojourn far away from the dear ones, and a crushing desire to see them:</div>
      <div class="line">The soul is in them, they became like their fellows, thus the enigma remains in the world;</div>
      <div class="line">While the generous is stricken with misfortune and grief, where’s the miser that finds not good fortune therein?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Attaf had finished he conversed with the Caliph about his history and
all his life from beginning to end; and Er-Rashid cried and suffered at
what had happened to him after the loss of his riches, nor did he cease to weep
with Ja’afar until the close of Attaf’s story. The Sheikh who had killed the
lad and had been liberated by Ja’afar came in and Er-Rashid laughed at seeing
him. Then he caused Attaf to be seated and made him repeat his story.
And when Attaf had finished speaking the Caliph looked at Ja’afar and said,
The proverb goeth:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Good for good, to the giver the merit remains; evil for evil, the doer’s most cruel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Afterwards the Caliph said to Ja’afar, Tell me what thou didst for thy brother
Attaf before he came to thee, and he answered, O Commander of the Faithful,
he came upon me suddenly, and I now prepare for him three millions of gold,
and the like of it in horses, and in slaves, and in boys, and in dresses; and the
Caliph said, From me the same. Here endeth the last leaf of the writ, but the
Rawi says that two days afterwards Ja’afar restored to his friend Attaf his
beloved cousin-wife, saying to him, I have divorced her and now I deliver over
to thee intact the precious deposit that thou didst place in my hands. Already
hath the order from the Caliph been despatched to Damascus enjoining the
arrest of the Naib, to place him in irons and imprison him until further notice.
Attaf passed several months in Baghdad enjoying the pleasures of the city in
company with his friend Ja’afar and Er-Rashid. He would have liked to have
stayed there all his life, but numerous letters from his relations and his friends
praying him to return to Damascus, he thought it his duty to do so, and asked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>leave of the Caliph, who granted it, not without regrets and fears for his future
condition. Er-Rashid appointed him Wali of Damascus and gave him the
imperial rescript; and a great escort of horses, mules and dromedaries, with
abundant magnificent presents accompanied him as far as Damascus, where
he was received with great pomp. All the city was illuminated as a mark of
joy for the return of Attaf, so loved and respected by all classes of the people,
and above all by the poor who had wept incessantly for him in his absence.
As to the Naib, a second decree of the Caliph ordered his being put to death
for his oppression of the people, but by the generous intercession of Attaf
Er-Rashíd contented himself with commuting the sentence to banishment.
Attaf governed his people many years with justice and prosperity, protector
of his happy subjects and in the enjoyment of the delights and pleasures of
life, until the Angel of Death overtook him and summoned him to Paradise.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class="c010">It is related (but Allah is All-knowing of His unknown and
All-cognisant of what took place and forewent in the annals of
folk!) that there was, in days of yore and in times and tides long
gone before, a tribe of the tribes of the Arabs hight Banú Hilál<a id="r380"></a><a href="#f380" class="c011"><sup>[380]</sup></a>
whose head men were the Emir Hilál and the Emir Salámah.<a id="r381"></a><a href="#f381" class="c011"><sup>[381]</sup></a>
Now this Emir Salamah had well nigh told out his tale of days
without having been blessed with boon of child; withal he was
a ruler valiant, masterful, a fender of his foes and a noble knight
of portly presence. He numbered by the thousand horsemen the
notablest of cavaliers and he came to overrule three-score-and-six
tribes of the Arabs. One chance night of the nights as he lay
sleeping in the sweetness of slumber, a Voice addressed him
saying, “Rise forthright and know thy wife, whereby she shall
<span class="pageno" id="Page_226">226</span>conceive under command of Allah Almighty.” Being thus disturbed
of his rest the Emir sprang up and compressed his spouse
Kamar al-Ashráf;<a id="r382"></a><a href="#f382" class="c011"><sup>[382]</sup></a> she became pregnant by that embrace and
when her days came to an end she bare a boy as the full moon
of the fulness-night who by his father’s hest was named Habíb.<a id="r383"></a><a href="#f383" class="c011"><sup>[383]</sup></a>
And as time went on his sire rejoiced in him with joy exceeding
and reared him with fairest rearing and bade them teach him
Koran-reading together with the glorious names of Almighty
Allah and instruct him in writing and in all the arts and sciences.
After this he bestowed robes of honour and gifts of money and
raiment upon the teachers who had made the Sultan<a id="r384"></a><a href="#f384" class="c011"><sup>[384]</sup></a> Habib,
when he reached the age of seventeen, the most intelligent and
penetrating and knowing amongst the sons of his time. And
indeed men used to admire at the largeness of his understanding
and were wont to say in themselves, “There is no help but that
this youth shall rise to dignity (and what dignity!) whereof men
of highmost intellect shall make loud mention. For he could
write the seven caligraphs<a id="r385"></a><a href="#f385" class="c011"><sup>[385]</sup></a> and he could recite traditions and
he could improvise poetry; and, on one occasion when his father
bade him versify impromptu, that he might see what might come
thereof, he intoned:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my sire, I am lord of all lere man knows or knew— ✿ Have enformed my vitals with lore and with legend true;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor cease I repeat what knowledge this memory guards ✿ And my writ as ruby and pearl doth appear to view.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So the Emir Salamah his sire marvelled at the elegance of his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>son’s diction; and the Notables of the clan, after hearing his
poetry and his prose, stood astounded at their excellence; and
presently the father clasped his child to his breast and forthright
summoned his governor, to whom there and then he did honour
of the highmost. Moreover he largessed him with four camels
carrying loads of gold and silver and he set him over one of his
subject tribes of the Arabs; then said he to him, “Indeed thou
hast done well, O Shaykh; so take this good and fare therewith
to such a tribe and rule it with justice and equity until the day of
thy death.” Replied the governor, “O King of the Age, I may on
no wise accept thy boons, for that I am not of mankind but of
Jinn-kind; nor have I need of money or requirement of rule. Know
thou, O my lord, that erst I sat as Kázi amongst the Jinns and I
was enthroned amid the Kings of the Jánn, whenas one night of
the nights a Voice<a id="r386"></a><a href="#f386" class="c011"><sup>[386]</sup></a> addressed me in my sleep saying, “Rise and
hie thee to the Sultan Habib son of the Emir Salamah ruler of
the tribes of the Arabs subject to the Banu Hilal and become
his tutor and teach him all things teachable; and, if thou gainsay
going, I will tear thy soul from thy body.” Now when I saw
this marvel-vision in my sleep, I straightway arose and repairing
to thy son did as I was bidden.”<a id="r387"></a><a href="#f387" class="c011"><sup>[387]</sup></a> But as the Emir Salamah
heard the words of this Shaykh he bowed him down and kissing
his feet cried, “Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord, who hath
vouchsafed thee to us of His bounty; and indeed thy coming
to us was of good omen, O Judge of the Jann.” “Where is thy
son?” quoth the governor and quoth the father, “Ready, aye
ready;” then he summoned his child and when the Shaykh
looked upon his pupil he wept with sore weeping and cried,
“Parting from thee, O Habib, is heavy upon us,” presently
<span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span>adding, “Ah! were ye to wot all that shall soon befal this
youth after my departure and when afar from me!”<a id="r388"></a><a href="#f388" class="c011"><sup>[388]</sup></a> Those
present in the assembly at once asked saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And what shall, O Shaykh, to us fall forthright? ✿ Quoth he, ‘Sore marvels shall meet your sight’:</div>
      <div class="line">No heart have I to describe it you”. ✿ Then approached Habib the same tutor-wight;</div>
      <div class="line">And clasping the youth to the breast of him, ✿ Kissed his cheek a-shrieking the shrillest shright.<a id="r389"></a><a href="#f389" class="c011"><sup>[389]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whereupon all about them were perturbed and were amated and
amazed at the action of the Shaykh when, vanishing from their
view, he could nowhere be seen. Then the Emir Salamah addressed
the lieges saying, “Ho ye Arabs, who wotteth what
presently shall betide my son? would Heaven I had one to
advise him!” Hereupon said his Elders and Councillors, “We
know of none.” But the Sultan Habib brooded over the disappearance
of his governor and bespake his sire weeping bitter
tears the while, “O my father, where be he who brought me up
and enformed me with all manner knowledge?” and the Emir
replied, “O my son, one day of the days he farewelled us and
crying out with a loud cry evanished from our view and we
have seen him no more.” Thereupon the youth improvised and
said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed I am scourged by those ills whereof I felt affray, ah! ✿ By parting and thoughts which oft compelled my soul to say, ‘Ah!’</div>
      <div class="line">Oh saddest regret in vitals of me that ne’er ceaseth, nor ✿ Shall minished be his love that still on my heart doth prey, ah!</div>
      <div class="line">Where hath hied the generous soul my mind with lere adorned? ✿ And alas! what hath happened, O sire, to me, and well-away, ah!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereat the Emir Salamah shed tears (as on like wise did all
present) and quoth he to his son, “O Habib, we have been
troubled by his action,” and quoth the youth, “How shall I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_229">229</span>endure severance from one who fostered me and brought me to
honour and renown and who raised my degree so high?” Then
began he to improvise saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed this pine in my heart grows high, ✿ And in eyeballs wake doth my sleep outvie:</div>
      <div class="line">You marched, O my lords, and from me hied far ✿ And you left a lover shall aye outcry:</div>
      <div class="line">I wot not where on this earth you be ✿ And how long this patience when none is nigh:</div>
      <div class="line">Ye fared and my eyeballs your absence weep, ✿ And my frame is meagre, my heart is dry.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now whilst the Emir Salamah was sitting in his seat of dignity
and the Sultan Habib was improvising poetry and shedding tears
in presence of his sire, they heard a Voice which announced itself
and its sound was audible whilst its personality was invisible.
Thereupon the youth shed tears and cried, “O father mine, I need
one who shall teach me horsemanship and the accidents of edge
and point and onset and offset and spearing and spurring in the
Maydán; for my heart loveth knightly derring-do to plan, such
as riding in van and encountering the horseman and the valiant
man.” And the while they were in such converse behold, there
appeared before them a personage rounded of head, long of
length and dread, with turband wide dispread, and his breadth
of breast was armoured with doubled coat of mail whose manifold
rings were close-enmeshed after the model of Dáúd<a id="r390"></a><a href="#f390" class="c011"><sup>[390]</sup></a> the
Prophet (upon whom be The Peace!) Moreover he hent in
hand a mace erst a block cut out of the live hard rock, whose
shock would arrest forty braves of the doughtiest; and he was
baldrick’d with an Indian blade that quivered in the grasp,
and he bestrode, with a Samhari<a id="r391"></a><a href="#f391" class="c011"><sup>[391]</sup></a> lance at rest, a bay destrier
of black points whose peer was not amongst the steeds of the
Arabs. Then he took his station standing as a vassal between
<span class="pageno" id="Page_230">230</span>the Emir Salamah’s hands and he addressed a general salam and
he greeted all that stood afoot or were seated. His salute they
repeated and presently the pages hastened forwards and aided
him alight from his charger’s back; and after waiting for a full-told
hour that he might take somewhat of repose, the stranger-knight
and doughty wight advanced and said, “Ho thou the
Emir, I came hither to fulfil the want whereof thou expressedst a
wish; and, if such prove thy pleasure, I will teach thy son fray and
fight and prowess in the plain of sword-stroke and lance-lunge.
But ere so doing I would fain test thy skill in cavalarice; so
do thou, O Emir, be first to appear as champion and single combatant
in the field when I will show thee what horsemanship is.”
“Hearkening and obeying,” replied the Emir, “and if thou desire
the duello with us we will not baulk thee thereof.” Hereat his
Shaykhs and Chieftains sprang up and cried to him, “O Emir,
Allah upon thee do not meet in fight this cavalier for that thou
wottest not an he be of mankind or of Jinn-kind; so be thou not
deceived by his sleights and snares.” “Suffer me this day,” quoth
the Emir, “to see the cavalarice of this cavalier, and, if over me
he prevail, know him to be a knight with whom none may avail.”
Speaking thus the Emir arose and hied him to his tent where he
bade the slaves bring forth the best of his habergeons; and, when
all these were set before him, he took from them a Davidian suit
of manifold rings and close-meshed, which he donned, and he
baldrick’d himself with a scymitar of Hindi steel, hadst thou
smitten therewith a cliff it had cleft it in twain or hadst thou
stricken a hill it had been laid level as a plain; and he hent in
hand a Rudaynían lance<a id="r392"></a><a href="#f392" class="c011"><sup>[392]</sup></a> of Khatt Hajar, whose length was thirty
ells and upon whose head sat a point like unto a basilisk’s tongue;
and lastly he bade his slaves bring him his courser which in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>race was the fleetest-footed of all horses. Then the two combatants
took the plain accompanied by the tribesmen nor did one
of them all, or great or small, remain in camp for desire to witness
the fight of these champions who were both as ravening lions.
But first the stranger-knight addressed his adversary and speaking
with free and eloquent tongue quoth he, “I will encounter thee,
O Emir Salamah, with the encountering of the valiant; so have
thou a heed of me for I am he hath overthrown the Champions
some and all.” At these words each engaged his foeman and
the twain forwards pressed for a long time, and the Raven of
cut-and-thrust croaked over the field of fight and they exchanged
strokes with the Hindi scymitar and they thrust and foined with
the Khatti spear and more than one blade and limber lance was
shivered and splintered, all the tribesmen looking on the while
at both. And they ceased not to attack and retire and to
draw near and draw off and to heave and fence until their forearms
ailed and their endeavour failed. Already there appeared in
the Emir Salamah somewhat of weakness and weariness; natheless
when he looked upon his adversary’s skill in the tourney
and encounter of braves he saw how to meet all the foeman’s
sword-strokes with his targe: however at last fatigue and loss of
strength prevailed over him and he knew that he had no longer
the force to fight; so he stinted his endeavour and withdrew from
brunt of battle. Hereat the stranger knight alighted and falling
at the Emir’s feet kissed them and cried, “O Sovran of the Age,
I came not hither to war with thee but rather with the design of
teaching thy son, the Sultan Habib, the complete art of arms and
make him the prow cavalier of his day.” Replied Salamah, “In
very sooth, O horseman of the age, thou hast spoken right fairly
in thy speech; nor did I design with thee to fight nor devised I
the duello or from steed to alight;<a id="r393"></a><a href="#f393" class="c011"><sup>[393]</sup></a> nay, my sole object was my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>son to incite that he might learn battle and combat aright, and the
charge of the heroic Himyarite<a id="r394"></a><a href="#f394" class="c011"><sup>[394]</sup></a> to meet with might.” Then the
twain dismounted and each kissed his adversary; after which they
returned to the tribal camp and the Emir bade decorate it and all
the habitations of the Arab clans with choicest decoration, and
they slaughtered the victims and spread the banquets and throughout
that day the tribesmen ate and drank and fed the travellers
and every wayfarer and the mean and mesquin and all the
miserables. Now as soon as the Sultan Habib was informed
concerning that cavalier how he had foiled his father in the field
of fight, he repaired to him and said, “Peace be with him who
came longing for us and designing our society! Who art thou,
Ho thou the valorous knight and foiler of foemen in fight?”
Said the other, “Learn thou, O Habib, that Allah hath sent me
theewards.” “And, say me, what may be thy name?” “I am
hight Al-’Abbús,<a id="r395"></a><a href="#f395" class="c011"><sup>[395]</sup></a> the Knight of the Grim Face.” “I see thee
only smiling of countenance whilst thy name clean contradicteth
thy nature;” quoth the youth. Presently the Emir Salamah
committed his son to the new governor saying, “I would thou
make me this youth <em>the</em> Brave of his epoch;” whereto the knight
replied, “To hear is to obey, first Allah then thyself and to do
suit and service of thy son Habib.” And when this was determined
youth and governor went forth to the Maydan every day
and after a while of delay Habib became the best man of his age
in fight and fray. Seeing this his teacher addressed him as
follows. “Learn, O Sultan Habib, that there is no help but
thou witness perils and affrights and adventures, wherefor is weak
the description of describers and thou shalt say in thyself:—Would
<span class="pageno" id="Page_233">233</span>heaven I had never sighted such and I were of these same
free. And thou shalt fall into every hardship and horror until
thou be united with the beautiful Durrat al-Ghawwás, Queen-regnant
over the Isles of the Sea. Meanwhile to affront all the
perils of the path thou shalt fare forth from thy folk and bid
adieu to thy tribe and patrial stead; and, after enduring that
which amateth man’s wit, thou shalt win union with the daughter
of Queen Kamar al-Zamán<a id="r396"></a><a href="#f396" class="c011"><sup>[396]</sup></a>.” But when Habib heard these
words concerning the “Pearl of the Diver” his wits were wildered
and his senses were agitated and he cried to Al-Abbus, “I
conjure thee by Allah say me, is this damsel of mankind or of
Jinn-kind.” Quoth the other, “Of Jinn-kind, and she hath two
Wazirs, one of either race, who overrule all her rulers and a
thousand islands of the Isles of the Sea are subject to her
command, while a host of Sayyids and Sharífs<a id="r397"></a><a href="#f397" class="c011"><sup>[397]</sup></a> and Grandees
hath flocked to woo her, bringing wealthy gifts and noble presents,
yet hath not any of them won his wish of her but all returned
baffled and baulked of their will.” Now the Sultan Habib
hearing this from him cried in excess of perturbation and stress
of confusion, “Up with us and hie we home where we may take
seat and talk over such troublous matter and debate anent its
past and its future.” “Hearkening and obedience,” rejoined the
other; so the twain retired into privacy in order to converse at
ease concerning the Princess, and Al-Abbus began to relate in
these words—</p>

  <span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>
  <h3 class="c015"><em>THE HISTORY OF DURRAT AL-GHAWWAS.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">Whilome there was a Sovran amongst the Kings of the Sea,
hight Sábúr, who reigned over the Crystalline Isles,<a id="r398"></a><a href="#f398" class="c011"><sup>[398]</sup></a> and he was
a mighty ruler and a generous, and a masterful potentate and
a glorious. He loved women and he was at trouble to seek out
the fairest damsels; yet many of his years had gone by nor
yet had he been blessed with boon of boy. So one day of the
days he took thought and said in himself, “To this length of
years I have attained and am well nigh at life’s end and still
am I childless: what then will be my case?” Presently, as he
sat upon his throne of kingship, he saw enter to him an Ifrit fair
of face and form, the which was none other than King ’Atrús<a id="r399"></a><a href="#f399" class="c011"><sup>[399]</sup></a>
of the Jánn, who cried, “The Peace be upon thee, Ho thou the
King! and know that I have come to thee from my liege lord
who affecteth thee. In my sleep it befel that I heard a Voice
crying to me:—During all the King’s days never hath he been
vouchsafed a child, boy or girl; so now let him accept my command
and he shall win to his wish. Let him distribute justice
and largesse and further the rights of the wronged and bid men
to good and forbid them from evil and lend not aid to tyranny
or to innovation in the realm and persecute not the unfortunate,
and release from gaol all the prisoners he retaineth. At these
words of the Voice I awoke astartled by my vision and I hastened
to thee without delay and I come with design to inform thee,
O King of the Age, that I have a daughter, hight Kamar al-Zaman,
who hath none like her in her time, and no peer in this tide, and
her I design giving thee to bride. The Kings of the Jann have
ofttimes asked her in marriage of me but I would have none of
them save a ruler of men like thyself and Alhamdolillah—glory
<span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>be to God, who caused thy Highness occur to my thought, for
that thy fame in the world is goodly fair and thy works make
for righteousness. And haply by the blessing of these thou shalt
beget upon my daughter a man child, a pious heir and a virtuous.”
Replied the King, “Ho thou who comest to us and desirest
our weal, I accept thine offer with love and good will.” Then
Sabur, the King of the Crystalline Isles, bade summon the Kazi
and witnesses, and quoth the Ifrit, “I agree to what thou sayest,
and whatso thou proposest that will I not oppose.” So they
determined upon the dowry and bound him by the bond of
marriage with the daughter of Al-’Atrus, King of the Jinns, who
at once sent one of his Flying Jann to bring the bride. She
arrived forthright when they dressed and adorned her with all
manner ornaments, and she came forth surpassing all the maidens
of her era. And when King Sabur went in unto her he found
her a clean maid: so he lay that night with her and Almighty
Allah so willed that she conceived of him. When her days and
months of pregnancy were sped, she was delivered of a girl-babe
as the moon, whom they committed to wet-nurses and dry-nurses,
and when she had reached her tenth year, they set over
her duennas who taught her Koran-reading and writing and
learning and <em>belles-lettres</em>; brief, they brought her up after the
fairest of fashions. Such was the lot<a id="r400"></a><a href="#f400" class="c011"><sup>[400]</sup></a> of Durrat al-Ghawwas,
the child of Kamar al-Zaman, daughter to King ’Atrus by her
husband King Sabur. But as regards the Sultan Habib and his
governor Al-Abbus, the twain ceased not wandering from place
to place in search of the promised damsel until one day of the
days when the youth entered his father’s garden and strolled the
walks adown amid the borders<a id="r401"></a><a href="#f401" class="c011"><sup>[401]</sup></a> and blossoms of basil and of
rose full blown and solaced himself with the works of the Compassionate
<span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>One and enjoyed the scents and savours of the flowers
there bestrown; and, while thus employed, behold, he suddenly
espied the maiden, Durrat al-Ghawwas hight, entering therein as
she were the moon; and naught could be lovelier than she of all
earth supplies, gracious as a Huriyah of the Virgins of Paradise,
to whose praise no praiser could avail on any wise. But when the
Sultan Habib cast upon her his eyes he could no longer master
himself and his wits were bewildered from the excitement of his
thoughts; so he regarded her with a long fixed look and said in
himself, “I fear whenas she see me that she will vanish from my
sight.” Accordingly, he retired and clomb the branches of a tree in
a stead where he could not be seen and whence he could see her
at his ease. But as regards the Princess, she ceased not to roam
about the Emir Salamah’s garden until there approached her two
score of snow-white birds each accompanied by a handmaid of
moon-like beauty. Presently they settled upon the ground and
stood between her hands saying, “Peace be upon thee, O our
Queen and Sovran Lady.” She replied, “No welcome to you and
no greeting; say me, what delayed you until this hour when ye
know that I am longing to meet the Sultan Habib, the dear one,
son of Salamah, and I long to visit him for that he is the dearling
of my heart. Wherefor I bade you accompany me and ye obeyed
not, and haply ye have made mock of me and of my commandment.”
“We never gainsay thy behest,” replied they, “or in word
or in deed;” and they fell to seeking her beloved. Hearing this
the Sultan Habib’s heart was solaced and his mind was comforted
and his thoughts were rightly directed and his soul was reposed;
and when he was certified of her speech, he was minded to appear
before her; but suddenly fear of her prevailed over him and he
said to his thoughts, “Haply she will order one of the Jinns to
do me die; so ’twere better to have patience and see what Allah
shall purpose for me of His Almighty will.” But the Princess
and her attendants ceased not wandering about the garden from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>site to site and side to side till they reached the place wherein
the Sultan Habib lay in lurking; when Durrat al-Ghawwas there
stood still and said in herself, “Now I came not from my capital
save on his account, and I would see and be seen by him even
as the Voice informed me of him, O ye handmaidens; and
peradventure hath the same informed him of me.” Then the
Princess and her suite, drawing still nearer to his place of concealment,
found a lakelet in the Arab’s garden brimful of water
amiddlemost whereof stood a brazen lion, through whose mouth
the water entered to issue from his tail. Hereat the Princess
marvelled and said to her bondswomen, “This be none other
than a marvellous lake, together with the lion therein; and when,
by the goodwill of Almighty Allah, I shall have returned home
I will let make a lakelet after this fashion, and in it set a lion of
brass.” Thereupon she ordered them to doff their dress and go
down to the piece of water and swim about; but they replied,
“O our lady, to hear is to obey thy commandment, but we will
not strip nor swim save with thee.” Then she also did off her
dress and all stripped themselves and entered the lakelet in a
body, whereupon the Sultan Habib looked through the leaves to
solace himself with the fair spectacle and he ejaculated, “Blessed
be the Lord the best of Creators!” And when the handmaids
waxed aweary of swimming, the Princess commanded them to
come forth the water, and said “Whenas Heaven willeth that the
desire of my heart be fulfilled in this garden, what deem ye I
should do with my lover?” and quoth they, “’Twould only add
to our pleasure and gladness.” Quoth she, “Verily my heart
assureth me that he is here and hidden amongst the trees of yon
tangled brake;” and she made signs with her hand whither
Habib lay in lurking-place; and he, espying this, rejoiced with
joy galore than which naught could be more, and exclaimed,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great: what meaneth this lady? Indeed, I fear
<span class="pageno" id="Page_238">238</span>to stay in this stead lest she come hither and draw me forth and
put me to shame; and ’twere better that of mine own accord
I come out of my concealment and accost her and suffer her to do
all she designeth and desireth.” So he descended from the
topmost of the tree wherein he had taken refuge and presented
himself before the Princess Durrat al-Ghawwas, who drew near
and cried to him, “O Habib, O welcome to Habib! and is it thus
that we have travailed with love of thee and longing for thee, and
where hast thou been all this time, O my dearling, and O coolth
of my eyes and O slice of my liver?” Replied he, “I was in
the head of yonder huge tree to which thou pointedst with thy
finger.” And as they looked each at other she drew nearer to him
and fell to improvising:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou hast doomed me, O branchlet of Bán, to despair ✿ Who in worship and honour was wont to fare,—</div>
      <div class="line">Who lived in rule and folk slaved for me ✿ And hosts girded me round every hest to bear!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_c236a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>

<p class="c000">And anon quoth the Sultan Habib; “Alhamdolillah—laud be to
the Lord, who deigned show me thy face and thy form! Can it
be thou kennest not what it was that harmed me and sickened
me for thy sake, O Durrat al-Ghawwas?” Quoth she, “And what
was it hurt thee and ailed thee?” “It was the love of thee and
longing for thee!” “And who was the first to tell thee and make
thee ware of me?” He replied saying, “One day it so befel, as
I was amongst my family and my tribe, a Jinni Al-Abbus hight
became my governor and taught me the accidents of thrust and
cut and cavalarice; and ere he left he commended thy beauty and
loveliness and foretold to me all that would pass between thee and
me. So I was engrossed with affection for thee ere my eyes had
sight of thee, and thenceforwards I lost all the pleasures of sleep,
nor were meat and eating sweet to me, nor were drink and winedraughts
a delight to me: so Alhamdolillah—praise be to Allah,
who deigned conjoin me in such union with my heart’s desire!”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>Hereat the twain exchanged an embrace so long that a swoon
came upon them and both fell to the ground in a fainting fit, but
after a time the handmaidens raised them up and besprinkled their
faces with rose-water which at once revived them. All this
happened, withal the Emir Salamah wotted naught of what had
befallen his son the Sultan Habib nor did his mother weet that
had betided her child; and the husband presently went in to his
spouse and said, “Indeed this boy hath worn us out: we see that
o’ nights he sleepeth not in his own place and this day he fared
forth with the dawn and suffered us not to see a sight of him.”
Quoth the wife, “Since the day he went to Al-Abbus, thy boy
fell into cark and care;” and quoth the husband, “Verily our son
walked about the garden and Allah knoweth that therefrom is no
issue anywhither. So there shalt thou find him and ask him of
himself.” And they talked over this matter in sore anger and
agitation. Meanwhile as the Sultan Habib sat in the garden with
the handmaids waiting upon him and upon the Princess Durrat
al-Ghawwas, there suddenly swooped upon them a huge bird which
presently changed form to a Shaykh seemly of aspect and
semblance who approached and kissing their feet humbled himself
before the lover and his beloved. The youth marvelled at such
action of the Shaykh, and signalled to the Princess as to ask,
“Who may be this old man?” and she answered in the same way,
“This is the Wazir who caused me forgather with thee;” presently
adding to the Shaykh, “What may be thy need?” “I came hither
for the sake of thee,” he replied, “and unless thou fare forthright
to thy country and kingdom the rule of the Jánn will pass from
thy hand; for that the Lords of the land and Grandees of the
realm seek thy loss and not a few of the nobles have asked me
saying, O Wazir, where is our Queen? I answered, She is within
her palace and to-day she is busied with some business. But such
pretext cannot long avail, and thou, unless thou return with me to
the region of thy reign there shall betray thee some one of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_240">240</span>Marids and the hosts will revolt against thee and thy rule will go
to ruin and thou wilt be degraded from command and sultanat.”
“What then is thy say and what thy bidding?” enquired she, and
he replied, “Thou hast none other way save departure from this
place and return to thy realm.” Now when these words reached
the ear of Durrat al-Ghawwas, her breast was straitened and she
waxed sorrowful with exceeding sorrow for severance from her
lover whom she addressed in these words, “What sayest thou anent
that thou hast heard? In very sooth I desire not parting from
thee and the ruin of my reign as little do I design; so come with
me, O dearling of my heart, and I will make thee liege lord over
the Isles of the Sea and sole master thereof.” Hereat the Sultan
Habib said in his soul, “I cannot endure parting from my own
people; but as for thee thy love shall never depart from thee:” then
he spake aloud, “An thou deign hear me, do thou abandon that
which thou purposest and bid thy Wazir rule over the Isles and thy
patrial stead; so shall we twain, I and thou, live in privacy for
all time and enjoy the most joyous of lives.” “That may never
be,” was her only reply; after which she cried to the Wazir
saying, “Carry me off that I fare to my own land.” Then after
farewelling her lover, she mounted the Emir-Wazir’s back<a id="r402"></a><a href="#f402" class="c011"><sup>[402]</sup></a> and
bade him bear<a id="t240"></a> her away, whereat he took flight and the forty
handmaidens flew with him, towering high in air. Presently,
the Sultan Habib shed bitter tears; his mother hearing him weeping
sore as he sat in the garden went to her husband and said,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>“Knowest thou not what calamity hath befallen thy son that I
hear him there groaning and moaning?” Now when the parents
entered the garden, they found him spent with grief and the tears
trickled adown his cheeks like never-ceasing rain-showers;<a id="r403"></a><a href="#f403" class="c011"><sup>[403]</sup></a> so they
summoned the pages who brought cucurbits of rose-water wherewith
they besprinkled his face. But as soon as he recovered his
senses and opened his eyes, he fell to weeping with excessive
weeping and his father and mother likewise shed tears for the
burning of their hearts and asked him, “O Habib, what calamity
hath come down to thee and who of his mischief hath overthrown
thee? Inform us of the truth of thy case.” So he related all
that had betided between him and Durrat al-Ghawwas, and his
mother wept over him while his father cried, “O Habib, do thou
leave this say and this thy desire cast away that the joys of meat
and drink and sleep thou may enjoy alway.” But he made answer,
“O my sire, I will not slumber upon this matter until I shall sleep
the sleep of death.” “Arise thou, O my child,” rejoined the
Emir, “and let us return homewards,”<a id="r404"></a><a href="#f404" class="c011"><sup>[404]</sup></a> but the son retorted
“Verily I will not depart from this place wherein I was parted
from the dearling of my heart.” So the sire again urged him
saying, “These words do thou spare nor persist in this affair
because therefrom for thee I fear;” and he fell to cheering him
and comforting his spirits. After a while the Sultan Habib arose
and fared homewards beside his sire who kept saying to him,
“Patience, O my child, the while I assist thee in thy search for
this young lady and I send those who shall bring her to thee.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_242">242</span>“O my father,” rejoined the son, “I can no longer endure parting
from her; nay, ’tis my desire that thou load me sundry camels
with gold and silver and plunder and moneys that I may go forth
to seek her: and if I win to my wish and Allah vouchsafe me
length of life I will return unto you; but an the term of my days
be at hand then the behest be to Allah, the One, the Omnipotent.
Let not your breasts be straitened therefor and do ye hold and
believe that if I abide with you and see not the beloved of my soul
I shall perish of my pain while you be standing by to look upon
my death. So suffer me to wayfare and attain mine aim; for from
the day when my mother bare me ’twas written to my lot that I
journey over wild and wold and that I see and voyage over the
seas seven-fold.” Hereupon he fell to improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My heart is straitened with grief amain ✿ And my friends and familiars have wrought me pain;</div>
      <div class="line">And whene’er you’re absent I pine, and fires ✿ In my heart beweep what it bears of bane:</div>
      <div class="line">O ye, who fare for the tribe’s domain, ✿ Cry aloud my greetings to friends so fain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when the Emir Salamah heard these his son’s verses, he bade
pack for him four camel loads of the rarest stuffs, and he largessed
to him a she-dromedary laden with thrones of red gold; then he
said to him, “Lo, O my son, I have given thee more than thou
askedst.” “O my father,” replied Habib, “where are my steed
and my sword and my spear?” Hereat the pages brought forward
a mail-coat Davidian<a id="r405"></a><a href="#f405" class="c011"><sup>[405]</sup></a> and a blade Maghrabian and a lance Khattian
and Samharian, and set them between his hands; and the
Sultan Habib donning the habergeon and drawing his sabre and
sitting lance in rest backed his steed, which was of the noblest
blood known to all the Arabs. Then quoth he, “O my father is
it thy desire to send with me a troop of twenty knights that they
may escort me to the land of Al-Yaman and may anon bring me
<span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>back to thee?” “My design,” quoth the sire, “is to despatch those
with thee who shall befriend thee upon the road;” and, when
Habib prayed him do as he pleased, the Emir appointed to him
ten knights, valorous wights, who dreaded naught of death however
sudden and awesome. Presently, the youth farewelled his
father and mother, his family and his tribe, and joining his escort,
mounted his destrier when Salamah, his sire, said to his company,
“Be ye to my son obedient in all he shall command you;” and
said they, “Hearing and obeying.” Then Habib and his many
turned away from home and addressed them to the road when
he began to improvise the following lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My longing grows less and far goes my cark ✿ After flamed my heart with the love-fire stark;</div>
      <div class="line">As I ride to search for my soul’s desire ✿ And I ask of those faring to Al-Irák.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">On this wise it befel the Sultan Habib and his farewelling his
father and mother; but now lend ear to what came of the knights
who escorted him. After many days of toil and travail they waxed
discontented and disheartened; and presently taking counsel one
with other, they said, “Come, let us slay this lad and carry off the
loads of stuffs and coin he hath with him; and when we reach our
homes and be questioned concerning him, let us say that he died
of the excess of his desire to Princess Durrat al-Ghawwas.” So
they followed this rede, while their lord wotted naught of the
ambush laid for him by his followers. And having ridden through
the day when the night of offence<a id="r406"></a><a href="#f406" class="c011"><sup>[406]</sup></a> was dispread, the escort said,
“Dismount we in this garden<a id="r407"></a><a href="#f407" class="c011"><sup>[407]</sup></a> that here we may take our rest
during the dark hours, and when morning shall morrow we will
resume our road.” The Sultan Habib had no mind to oppose
<span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>them, so all alighted and in that garden took seat and whatso of
victual was with them produced; after which they ate and drank
their sufficiency and lay down to sleep all of them save their lord,
who could not close eye for excess of love-longing. “O Habib,
why and wherefore sleepest thou not?” they asked, and he
answered, “O comrades mine, how shall slumber come to one
yearning for his dearling, and verily I will lie awake nor enjoy
aught repose until such time as I espy the life-blood of my heart,
Durrat al-Ghawwas.” Thereupon they held their peace; and
presently they held council one with other saying, “Who amongst
us can supply a dose of Bhang that we may cast him asleep and
his slaughter may be easy to us?” “I have two Miskáls weight<a id="r408"></a><a href="#f408" class="c011"><sup>[408]</sup></a>
of that same,” quoth one of them, and the others took it from him
and presently, when occasion served, they put it into a cup of water
and presented it to Habib. He hent that cup in hand and drank
off the drugged liquid at a single draught; and presently the Bhang
wrought in his vitals and its fumes mounted to his head, mastering
his senses and causing his brain to whirl round, whereupon he sank
into the depths of unconsciousness. Then quoth his escort, “As
soon as his slumber is soundest and his sleep heaviest we will arise
and slay him and bury him on the spot where he now sleepeth:
then will we return to his father and mother, and tell them that of
love-stress to his beloved and of excessive longing and pining for
her he died.” And upon this deed of treachery all agreed. So
when dawned the day and showed its sheen and shone clear and
serene, the knights awoke and seeing their lord drowned<a id="r409"></a><a href="#f409" class="c011"><sup>[409]</sup></a> in sleep
they arose and sat in council, and quoth one of them, “Let us cut
<span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>his throat from ear to ear;”<a id="r410"></a><a href="#f410" class="c011"><sup>[410]</sup></a> and quoth another, “Nay, better we
dig us a pit the stature of a man and we will cast him amiddlemost
thereof and heap upon him earth so that he will die, nor shall
any know aught about him.” Hearing this said one of the retinue,
whose name was Rabí’a,<a id="r411"></a><a href="#f411" class="c011"><sup>[411]</sup></a> “But fear you naught from Almighty
Allah and regard ye not the favours wherewith his father fulfilled
you, and remember ye not the bread which ye ate in his household
and from his family? Indeed ’twas but a little while since his sire
chose you out to escort him that his son might take solace with
you instead of himself, and he entrusted unto you his heart’s core,
and now ye are pleased to do him die and thereby destroy the life
of his parents. Furthermore, say me doth your judgment decide
that such ill-work can possibly abide hidden from his father? Now
I swear by the loyalty<a id="r412"></a><a href="#f412" class="c011"><sup>[412]</sup></a> of the Arabs there will not remain for us a
wight or any who bloweth the fire alight, however mean and slight,
who will receive us after such deed. So do ye at least befriend and
protect your households and your clans and your wives and your
children whom ye left in the tribal domain. But now you design
utterly to destroy us, one and all, and after death affix to our
memories the ill-name of traitors, and cause our women be enslaved
and our children enthralled, nor leave one of us aught to be longed
for.” Quoth they jeeringly, “Bring what thou hast of righteous
rede:” so quoth he, “Have you fixed your intent upon slaying
him and robbing his good?” and they answered, “We have.”
However, he objected again and cried, “Come ye and hear from
me what it is I advise you, albeit I will take no part<a id="r413"></a><a href="#f413" class="c011"><sup>[413]</sup></a> in this
matter;” presently adding, “Established is your resolve in this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>affair, and ye wot better than I what you are about to do. But
my mind is certified of this much; do ye not transgress in the
matter of his blood and suffer only his crime be upon you;<a id="r414"></a><a href="#f414" class="c011"><sup>[414]</sup></a> moreover,
if ye desire to lay hands upon his camels and his moneys and
his provisions, then do ye carry them off and leave him where he
lieth; then if he live, ’twere well, and if he die ’twill be even better
and far better.” “Thy rede is right and righteous,” they replied.
Accordingly they seized his steed and his habergeon and his sword
and his gear of battle and combat, and they carried off all he had
of money and means, and placing him naked upon the bare ground
they drove away his camels. Presently asked one of other,
“Whenas we shall reach the tribe what shall we say to his father
and his mother?” “Whatso Rabi’a shall counsel us,” quoth they,
and quoth Rabi’a, “Tell them:—We left not travelling with
your son; and, as we fared along we lost sight of him and we
saw him nowhere until we came upon him a-swoon and lying
on the road senseless: then we called to him by name but he
returned no reply, and when we shook him with our hands
behold, he had become a dried-up wand. Then seeing him dead
we buried him and brought back to you his good and his belongings.”
“And if they ask you,” objected one:—In what place did
ye bury him and in what land, and is the spot far or near, what
shall ye make answer; also if they say to you, “Why did ye not
bear his corpse with you, what then shall be your reply?” Rabi’a
to this rejoined, “Do you say to them:—Our strength was
weakened and we waxed feeble from burn of heart and want of
water, nor could we bring his remains with us. And if they ask
you:—Could ye not bear him a-back; nay, might ye not have
carried him upon one of the camels? do ye declare that ye could
not for two reasons, the first being that the body was swollen and
stinking from the fiery air, and the second our fear for his father,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>lest seeing him rotten he could not endure the sight and his sorrow
be increased for that he was an only child and his sire hath none
other.” All the men joined in accepting this counsel of Rabi’a,
and each and every exclaimed, “This indeed is the rede that is
most right.” Then they ceased not wayfaring until they reached
the neighbourhood of the tribe, when they sprang from their steeds
and openly donned black, and they entered the camp showing the
sorest sorrow. Presently they repaired to the father’s tent, grieving
and weeping and shrieking as they went; and when the Emir
Salamah saw them in this case, crowding together with keening
and crying for the departed, he asked them, “Where is he, my
son?” and they answered, “Indeed he is dead.” Right hard upon
Salamah was this lie, and his grief grew the greater, so he scattered
dust upon his head and plucked out his beard and rent his raiment
and shrieked aloud saying, “Woe for my son, ah! Woe for Habib,
ah! Woe for the slice of my liver, ah! Woe for my grief, ah!
Woe for the core<a id="r415"></a><a href="#f415" class="c011"><sup>[415]</sup></a> of my heart, ah!” Thereupon his mother
came forth, and seeing her husband in this case, with dust on his
head and his beard plucked out and his robe-collar<a id="r416"></a><a href="#f416" class="c011"><sup>[416]</sup></a> rent, and
sighting her son’s steed she shrieked, “Woe is me and well-away
for my child, ah!” and fainted swooning for a full-told hour.
Anon when recovered she said to the knights who had formed
the escort, “Woe to you, O men of evil, where have ye buried my
boy?” They replied, “In a far-off land whose name we wot not,
and ’tis wholly waste and tenanted by wild beasts,” whereat she
was afflicted exceedingly. Then the Emir Salamah and his wife
and household and all the tribesmen donned garbs black-hued and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>ashes whereupon to sit they strewed, and ungrateful to them was
the taste of food and drink, meat and wine; nor ceased they to
beweep their loss, nor could they comprehend what had befallen
their son and what of ill-lot had descended upon him from Heaven.
Such then was the case of them; but as regards the Sultan Habib,
he continued sleeping until the Bhang ceased to work in his brain,
when Allah sent a fresh, cool wind which entered his nostrils and
caused him sneeze, whereby he cast out the drug and sensed the
sun-heat and came to himself. Hereupon he opened his eyes and
sighted a wild and waste land, and he looked in vain for his companions
the knights, and his steed and his sword and his spear and
his coat of mail, and he found himself mother-naked, athirst, an-hungered.
Then he cried out in that Desert of desolation which
lay far and wide before his eyes, and the case waxed heavy upon
him, and he wept and groaned and complained of his case to Allah
Almighty, saying, “O my God and my Lord and my Master, trace
my lot an thou hast traced it upon the Guarded Tablet, for who
shall right me save Thyself, O Lord of Might that is All-might
and of Grandeur All-puissant and All-excellent!” Then he began
improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Faileth me, O my God, the patience with the pride o’ me; ✿ Life-tie is broke and drawing nigh I see Death-tide o’ me:</div>
      <div class="line">To whom shall injured man complain of injury and wrong ✿ Save to the Lord (of Lords the Best!) who stands by side o’ me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now whilst the Sultan Habib was ranging with his eye-corners to
the right and to the left behold, he beheld a blackness rising high
in air, and quoth he to himself, “Doubtless this dark object must
be a mighty city or a vast encampment, and I will hie me thither
before I be overheated by the sun-glow and I lose the power of
walking and I die of distress and none shall know my fate.” Then
he heartened his heart for the improvising of such poetry as came
to his mind, and he repeated these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_249">249</span>“Travel, for on the way all goodly things shalt find; ✿ And wake from sleep and dreams if still to sleep inclined!</div>
      <div class="line">Or victory win and rise and raise thee highmost high ✿ And gain, O giddy pate, the good for which thy soul hath pined;</div>
      <div class="line">Or into sorrow thou shalt fall with breast full strait ✿ And ne’er enjoy the Fame that wooes the gen’rous mind,</div>
      <div class="line">Nor is there any shall avail to hinder Fate ✿ Except the Lord of Worlds who the Two Beings<a id="r417"></a><a href="#f417" class="c011"><sup>[417]</sup></a> designed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he had finished his verse, the Sultan Habib walked in
the direction of that blackness nor left walking until he drew
near the ridge; but after he could fare no farther and that
walking distressed him (he never having been broken to travel
afoot and barefoot withal), and his forces waxed feeble and his
joints relaxed and his strong will grew weak and his resolution
passed away. But whilst he was perplexed concerning what he
should do, suddenly there alighted between his hands a snow-white
fowl huge as the dome of a Hammám, with shanks like the trunk
of a palm-tree. The Sultan Habib marvelled at the sight of this
Rukh and saying to himself, “Blessed be Allah the Creator!” he
advanced slowly towards it and all unknown to the fowl seized its
legs. Presently the bird put forth its wings (he still hanging on)
and flew upwards to the confines of the sky, when behold, a Voice
was heard saying, “O Habib! O Habib! hold to the bird with
straitest hold, else ’twill cast thee down to earth and thou shalt
be dashed to pieces limb from limb!” Hearing these words he
tightened his grasp and the fowl ceased not flying until it came to
that blackness which was the outline of Káf the mighty mountain,
and having set the youth down on the summit it left him and
still flew onwards. Presently a Voice sounded in the sensorium of
the Sultan Habib saying, “Take seat, O Habib; past is that which
conveyed thee hither on thy way to Durrat al-Ghawwas;” and he,
when the words met his ear, aroused himself and arose and, descending
the mountain slope to the skirting plain, saw therein a cave.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>Hereat quoth he to himself, “If I enter this antre, haply shall I lose
myself, and perish of hunger and thirst!” He then took thought
and reflected, “Now death must come sooner or later, wherefore
will I adventure myself in this cave.” And as he passed thereinto
he heard one crying with a high voice and a sound so mighty
that its volume resounded in his ears. But right soon the crier
appeared in the shape of Al-Abbus, the Governor who had taught
him battle and combat; and, after greeting him with great joy,
the lover recounted his love-adventure to his whilome tutor. The
Jinni bore in his left a scymitar, the work of the Jann and in his
right a cup of water which he handed to his pupil. The draught
caused him to swoon for an hour or so, and when he came to Al-Abbus
made him sit up and bathed him and robed him in the
rarest of raiment and brought him a somewhat of victual and the
twain ate and drank together. Then quoth Habib to Al-Abbus
“Knowest thou not that which befel me with Durrat al-Ghawwas
of wondrous matters?” and quoth the other, “And what may
that have been?” whereupon the youth rejoined, “O my brother,
Allah be satisfied with thee for that He willed thou appear to me
and direct me and guide me aright to the dearling of my heart
and the cooling of mine eyes.” “Leave thou such foolish talk,”
replied Al-Abbus, “for where art thou and where is Durrat al-Ghawwas?
Indeed between thee and her are horrors and perils
and long tracts of land and seas wondrous, and adventures marvellous,
which would amaze and amate the rending lions, and
spectacles which would turn grey the sucking child or any one of
man’s scions.” Hearing these words Habib clasped his governor
to his breast and kissed him between the eyes, and the Jinni said,
“O my beloved, had I the might to unite thee with her I would do
on such wise, but first ’tis my desire to make thee forgather with
thy family in a moment shorter than an eye-twinkling.” “Had I
longed for my own people,” rejoined Habib, “I should never have
left them, nor should I have endangered my days nor wouldst
<span class="pageno" id="Page_251">251</span>thou have seen me in this stead; but as it is I will never return
from my wayfaring till such time as my hope shall have been
fulfilled, even although my appointed life-term should be brought
to end, for I have no further need of existence.” To these words
the Jinni made answer, “Learn thou, O Habib, that the cavern
wherein thou art containeth the hoards of our Lord Solomon,
David’s son (upon the twain be The Peace!) and he placed them
under my charge and he forbade me abandon them until such time
as he shall permit me, and furthermore that I let and hinder both
mankind and Jinn-kind from entering the Hoard; and know thou,
O Habib, that in this cavern is a treasure-house and in the Treasury
forty closets offsetting to the right and to the left. Now wouldst
thou gaze upon this wealth of pearls and rubies and precious stones,
do thou ere passing through the first door dig under its threshold,
where thou shalt find buried the keys of all the magazines. Then
take the first of them in hand and unlock its door, after which
thou shalt be able to open all the others and look upon the store
of jewels therein. And when thou shalt design to depart the
Treasury thou shalt find a curtain hung up in front of thee and
fastened around it eighty hooks of red gold;<a id="r418"></a><a href="#f418" class="c011"><sup>[418]</sup></a> and do thou beware
how thou raise the hanging without quilting them all with cotton.”
So saying he gave him a bundle of tree-wool he had by him, and
pursued, “O Habib, when thou shalt have raised the curtain thou
wilt discover a door with two leaves also of red gold, whereupon
couplets are inscribed, and as regards the first distich an thou
master the meaning of the names and the talismans, thou shalt be
saved from all terrors and horrors, and if thou fail to comprehend
them thou shalt perish in that Hoard. But after opening the door
close it not with noise nor glance behind thee, and take all heed,
as I fear for thee those charged with the care of the place<a id="r419"></a><a href="#f419" class="c011"><sup>[419]</sup></a> and its
tapestry. And when thou shalt stand behind the hanging thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_252">252</span>shalt behold a sea clashing with billows dashing, and ’tis one of
the Seven Mains which shall show thee, O Habib, marvels whereat
thou shalt wonder, and whereof relaters shall relate the strangest
relations. Then do thou take thy stand upon the sea-shore whence
thou shalt descry a ship under way and do thou cry aloud to the
crew who shall come to thee and bear thee aboard. After this I
wot not what shall befal thee in this ocean, and such is the end of my
say and the last of my speech, O Habib, and—The Peace!” Hereat
the youth joyed with joy galore than which naught could be
more and taking the hand of Al-Abbus he kissed it and said, “O
my brother, thou hast given kindly token in what thou hast spoken,
and Allah requite thee for me with all weal, and mayest thou be
fended from every injurious ill!” Quoth Al-Abbus, “O Habib, take
this scymitar and baldrick thyself therewith, indeed ’twill enforce
thee and hearten thy heart, and don this dress which shall defend
thee from thy foes.” The youth did as he was bidden; then he
farewelled the Jinni and set forth on his way, and he ceased not
pacing forward until he reached the end of the cavern and here he
came upon the door whereof his governor had informed him. So he
went to its threshold and dug thereunder and drew forth a black
bag creased and stained by the lapse of years. This he unclosed
and it yielded him a key which he applied to the lock and it
forthwith opened and admitted him into the Treasury where, for
exceeding murk and darkness, he could not see what he hent in
hand. Then quoth he to himself, “What is to do? Haply Al-Abbus
hath compassed my destruction!” And the while he sat
on this wise sunken in thought, behold, he beheld a light gleaming
from afar, and as he advanced its sheen guided him to the curtain
whereof he had been told by the Jinni. But as he looked he saw
above it a tablet of emerald dubbed with pearls and precious stones,
while under it lay the hoard which lighted up the place like the rising
sun. So he hastened him thither and found inscribed upon the
tablet the following two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>“At him I wonder who from woe is free, ✿ And who no joy displays<a id="r420"></a><a href="#f420" class="c011"><sup>[420]</sup></a> when safe is he:</div>
      <div class="line">And I admire how Time deludes man when ✿ He views the past; but ah Time’s tyranny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_c256a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>

<p class="c000">So the Sultan Habib read over these verses more than once,
and wept till he swooned away; then recovering himself he said
in his mind, “To me death were pleasanter than life without my
love!” and turning to the closets which lay right and left he
opened them all and gazed upon the hillocks of gold and silver
and upon the heaps and bales of rubies and unions and precious
stones and strings of pearls, wondering at all he espied, and
quoth he to himself, “Were but a single magazine of these
treasures revealed, wealthy were all the peoples who on earth do
dwell.” Then he walked up to the curtain whereupon Jinns and
Ifrits appeared from every site and side, and voices and shrieks so
loudened in his ears that his wits well-nigh flew from his head.
So he took patience for a full-told hour when behold, a smoke
which spired in air thickened and brooded low, and the sound
ceased and the Jinns departed. Hereat, calling to mind the
charge of Al-Abbus, he took out the cotton he had by him and
after quilting the golden hooks he withdrew the curtain and
sighted the portal which the Jinni had described to him. So
he fitted in the key and opened it, after which, oblivious of the
warning, he slammed-to the door noisily in his fear and forgetfulness,
but he did not venture to look behind him. At this the
Jinns flocked to him from every side and site crying, “O thou
foulest of mankind, wherefore dost thou provoke us and disturb
us from our stead? and, but for thy wearing the gear of the
Jann, we had slain thee forthright.” But Habib answered not
and, arming himself with patience and piety, he tarried awhile
until the hubbub was stilled, nor did the Jann cry at him any
more: and, when the storm was followed by calm, he paced
<span class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>forward to the shore and looked upon the ocean crashing with
billows dashing. He marvelled at the waves and said to himself,
“Verily none may know the secrets of the sea and the mysteries
of the main save only Allah!” Presently, he beheld a ship
passing along shore, so he took seat on the strand until Night
let down her pall of sables upon him; and he was an-hungered
with exceeding hunger and athirst with excessive thirst. But
when morrowed the morn and day showed her sheen and shone
serene, he awoke in his sore distress and behold, he saw two
Mermaidens of the daughters of the deep (and both were as
moons) issue forth hard by him. And ere long quoth one of the
twain, “Say me, wottest thou the mortal who sitteth yonder?”
“I know him not,” quoth the other, whereat her companion
resumed, “This be the Sultan Habib who cometh in search of
Durrat al-Ghawwas, our Queen and liege lady.” Hearing these
words the youth considered them straitly and marvelling at their
beauty and loveliness he presently rejoiced and increased in
pleasure and delight. Then said one to other, “Indeed the Sultan
Habib is in this matter somewhat scant and short of wits; how
can he love Durrat al-Ghawwas when between him and her is a
distance only to be covered by the sea-voyage of a full year over
most dangerous depths? And, after all this woe hath befallen
him, why doth he not hie him home and why not save himself
from these horrors which promise to endure through all his
days and to cast his life at last into the pit of destruction?”
Asked the other, “Would heaven I knew whether he will ever
attain to her or not!” and her companion answered, “Yes, he
will attain to her, but after a time and a long time and much
sadness of soul.” But when Habib heard this promise of success
given by the Maidens of the Main his sorrow was solaced and
he lost all that troubled him of hunger and thirst. Now while he
pondered these matters there suddenly issued from out the ocean
a third Mermaid, which asked her fellows, “Of what are you
<span class="pageno" id="Page_255">255</span>prattling?” and they answered, “Indeed the Sultan Habib sitteth
here upon the sea-shore during this the fourth successive night.”
Quoth she, “I have a cousin the daughter of my paternal uncle
and when she came to visit me last night I enquired of her if any
ship had passed by her and she replied:—Yea verily, one did
sail driven towards us by a violent gale, and its sole object was
to seek you.” And the others rejoined, “Allah send thee tidings
of welfare!” The youth hearing these words was gladdened
and joyed with exceeding joy; and presently the three Mermaidens
called to one another and dove into the depths leaving the listener
standing upon the strand. After a short time he heard the cries
of the crew from the craft announced and he shouted to them
and they, noting his summons, ran alongside the shore and took
him up and bore him aboard: and, when he complained of
hunger and thirst, they gave him meat and drink and questioned
him saying, “Thou! who art thou? Say us, art of the traderfolk?”
“I am the merchant Such-and-such,” quoth he, “and
my ship foundered albe ’twas a mighty great vessel; but one
chance day of the days as we were sailing along there burst
upon us a furious gale which shivered our timbers and my companions
all perished while I floated upon a plank of the ship’s
planks and was carried ashore by the send of the sea. Indeed
I have been floating for three days and this be my fourth night.”
Hearing this adventure from him the traders cried, “Grieve no
more in heart but be thou of good cheer and of eyes cool and
clear: the sea voyage is ever exposed to such chances and so is
the gain thereby we obtain; and if Allah deign preserve us and
keep for us the livelihood He vouchsafed to us we will bestow
upon thee a portion thereof.” After this they ceased not sailing
until a tempest assailed them and blew their vessel to starboard
and larboard and she lost her course and went astray at sea.
Hereat the pilot cried aloud, saying, “Ho ye company aboard,
take your leave one of other for we be driven into unknown
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>depths of ocean, nor may we keep our course, because the wind
bloweth full in our faces.” Hereupon the voyagers fell to beweeping
the loss of their lives and their goods, and the Sultan
Habib shed tears which trickled adown his cheeks and exclaimed,
“Would Heaven I had died before seeing such torment: indeed
this is naught save a matter of marvel.” But when the merchants
saw the youth thus saddened and troubled of soul, and
weeping withal, they said to him, “O Monarch of the Merchants,
let not thy breast be straitened or thy heart be disheartened:
haply Allah shall vouchsafe joy to us and to thee: moreover, can
vain regret and sorrow of soul and shedding of tears avail aught?
Do thou rather ask of the Almighty that He deign relieve us and
further our voyage.” But as the vessel ran through the middle
of the main, she suddenly ceased her course and came to a stop
without tacking to the right or the left, and the pilot cried out,
“O folk, is there any of you who conneth this ocean?” But they
made answer, “We know thereof naught, neither in all our voyage
did we see aught resembling it.” The pilot continued, “O folk,
this main is hight ‘The Azure’;<a id="r421"></a><a href="#f421" class="c011"><sup>[421]</sup></a> nor did any trader at any time
therein enter but he found destruction; for that it is the home
of Jinns and the house of Ifrits, and he who now withholdeth our
vessel from its course is known as Al-Ghashamsham,<a id="r422"></a><a href="#f422" class="c011"><sup>[422]</sup></a> and our lord
Solomon son of David (upon the twain be The Peace!) deputed
him to snatch up and carry off from every craft passing through
these forbidden depths whatever human beings, and especially
merchants he might find a-voyaging, and to eat them alive.”
“Woe to thee!” cried Habib. “Wherefore bid us take counsel
together when thou tellest us that here dwelleth a Demon
over whom we have no power to prevail, and thou terrifiest us
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>with the thoughts of being devoured by him? However, feel ye
no affright; I will fend off from you the mischief of this Ifrit.”
They replied, “We fear for thy life, O Monarch of the Merchants,”
and he rejoined, “To you there is no danger.” Thereupon he
donned a closely woven mail-coat and armed himself with the
magical scymitar and spear; then, taking the skins of animals
freshly slain,<a id="r423"></a><a href="#f423" class="c011"><sup>[423]</sup></a> he made a hood and vizor thereof and wrapped
strips of the same around his arms and legs that no harm from
the sea might enter his frame. After this he bade his shipmates
bind him with cords under his armpits and let him down amiddlemost
the main. And as soon as he touched bottom he was
confronted by the Ifrit, who rushed forward to make a mouthful
of him, when the Sultan Habib raised his forearm and with the
scymitar smote him a stroke which fell upon his neck and hewed
him into two halves. So he died in the depths; and the youth,
seeing the foeman slain, jerked the cord and his mates drew
him up and took him in, after which the ship sprang forward
like a shaft outshot from the belly<a id="r424"></a><a href="#f424" class="c011"><sup>[424]</sup></a> of the bow. Seeing this all
the traders wondered with excessive wonderment and hastened
up to the youth, kissing his feet and crying, “O Monarch of the
Merchants, how didst thou prevail against him and do him die?”
“When I dropped into the depths,” replied he, “in order to slay
him, I asked against him the aidance of Allah, who vouchsafed
His assistance, and on such wise I slaughtered him.” Hearing
these good tidings and being certified of their enemy’s death the
traders offered to him their good and gains whereof he refused to
accept aught, even a single mustard seed. Now, amongst the
number was a Shaykh well shotten in years and sagacious in all
affairs needing direction; and this oldster drew near the youth, and
making lowly obeisance said to him, “By the right of Who sent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>thee uswards and sent us theewards, what art thou and what
may be thy name and the cause of thy falling upon this ocean?”
The Sultan Habib began by refusing to disclose aught of his
errand, but when the Shaykh persisted in questioning he ended by
disclosing all that had betided him first and last, and as they sailed
on suddenly the Pilot cried out to them, “Rejoice ye with great
joy and make ye merry and be ye gladdened with good news,
O ye folk, for that ye are saved from the dangers of these terrible
depths and ye are drawing near the city of Sábúr, the King who
overruleth the Isles Crystalline; and his capital (which be
populous and prosperous) ranketh first among the cities of Al-Hind,
and his reign is foremost of the Isles of the Sea.” Then the ship
inclined thither, and drawing nearer little by little entered the
harbour<a id="r425"></a><a href="#f425" class="c011"><sup>[425]</sup></a> and cast anchor therein, when the canoes<a id="r426"></a><a href="#f426" class="c011"><sup>[426]</sup></a> appeared and
the porters came on board and bore away the luggage of the
voyagers and the crew, who were freed from all sorrow and anxiety.
Such was their case; but as regards Durrat al-Ghawwas, when she
parted from her lover, the Sultan Habib, severance weighed sore
and stark upon her, and she found no pleasure in meat and drink
and slumber and sleep. And presently whilst in this condition
and sitting upon her throne of estate, an Ifrit appeared to her and
coming forwards between her hands said, “The Peace of Allah
be upon thee, O Queen of the Age and Empress of the Time and
the Tide!” whereto she made reply, “And upon thee be The Peace
and the ruth of Allah and His blessings. What seekest thou
O Ifrit?” Quoth he, “There lately hath come to us a shipful of
merchants and I have heard talk of the Sultan Habib being
amongst them.” As these words reached her ear she largessed the
Ifrit and said to him, “An thou speak sooth I will bestow upon
thee whatso thou wishest.” Then, having certified herself of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>news, she bade decorate the city with the finest of decorations and
let beat the kettledrums of glad tidings and bespread the way
leading to the Palace with a carpeting of sendal,<a id="r427"></a><a href="#f427" class="c011"><sup>[427]</sup></a> and they obeyed
her behest. Anon she summoned her pages and commanded them
to bring her lover before her; so they repaired to him and ordered
him to accompany them. Accordingly, he followed them and they
ceased not faring until they had escorted him to the Palace, when
the Queen bade all her pages gang their gait and none remained
therein save the two lovers; to wit, the Sultan Habib and Durrat
al-Ghawwas. And after the goodly reunion she sent for the Kazi
and his assessors and bade them write out her marriage-writ<a id="r428"></a><a href="#f428" class="c011"><sup>[428]</sup></a> with
Habib. He did as he was bidden and the witnesses bore testimony
thereto and to the dowry being duly paid; and the tie was formally
tied and the wedding banquets were dispread. Then the bride
donned her choicest of dresses and the marriage procession was
formed and the union was consummated and both joyed with joy
exceeding. Now this state of things endured for a long while until
the Sultan Habib fell to longing after his parents and his family
and his native country; and at length, on a day of the days, when
a banquet was served up to him by his bride he refused to taste
thereof, and she, noting and understanding his condition, said to
him, “Be of good cheer, this very night thou shalt find thee amongst
thine own folk.” Accordingly she summoned her Wazir of the
Jann, and when he came she made proclamation amongst the
nobles and commons of the capital saying, “This my Wazir shall
be my Viceregent over you and whoso shall gainsay him that man
I will slay.” They replied with “Hearkening to and obeying
Allah and thyself and the Minister.” Then turning to her newly-established
deputy she said, “I desire that thou guide me to the
garden wherein was the Sultan Habib;” and he replied, “Upon my
head be it and on my eyes!” So an Ifrit was summoned, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_260">260</span>Habib mounting him pick-a-back together with the Princess Durrat
al-Ghawwas bade him repair to the garden appointed, and the
Jinni took flight, and in less than the twinkling of an eye bore the
couple to their destination. Such was the reunion of the Sultan
Habib with Durrat al-Ghawwas and his joyous conjunction;<a id="r429"></a><a href="#f429" class="c011"><sup>[429]</sup></a> but
as regards the Emir Salamah and his wife, as they were sitting and
recalling to memory their only child and wondering in converse
at what fate might have betided him, lo and behold! the Sultan
Habib stood before them and by his side was Durrat al-Ghawwas
his bride, and as they looked upon him and her, weeping prevailed
over them for excess of their joyance and delight and both his
parents threw themselves upon him and fell fainting to the ground.
As soon as they recovered the youth told them all that had betided
him, first and last, whereupon one congratulated other and the
kettledrums of glad tidings were sounded, and a world of folk
from all the Badawi tribes and the burghers gathered about them
and offered hearty compliments on the reunion of each with other.
Then the encampment was decorated in whole and in part, and
festivities were appointed for a term of seven days full-told, in
token of joy and gladness; and banquets were arrayed and trays
were dispread, and all sat down to them in the pleasantest of life
eating and drinking; and the hungry were filled, and the mean
and the miserable and the mendicants were feasted until the end
of the seventh day. After this they applied them to the punishment
of the ten Knights whom the Emir Salamah had despatched
to escort his son; and the Sultan Habib gave order that retribution
be required from them, and restitution of all the coin and the
good and the horses and the camels entrusted to them by his sire.
When these had been recovered he commanded that there be set
up for them as many stakes in the garden wherein he sat with his
bride, and there in their presence he let impale<a id="r430"></a><a href="#f430" class="c011"><sup>[430]</sup></a> each upon his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_261">261</span>own pale. And thenceforward the united household ceased not
living the most joyous of lives and the most delectable until the
old Emir Salamah paid the debt of nature, and they mourned him
with excessive mourning for seven days. When these were ended
his son, the Sultan Habib, became ruler in his stead and received
the homage of all the tribes and clans who came before him and
prayed for his victory and his length of life; and the necks of his
subjects, even the most stubborn, were bowed in abasement before
him. On this wise he reigned over the Crystalline Isles of Sabur,
his sire-in-law, with justice and equity, and his Queen,
Durrat al-Ghawwas, bare to him children in numbers
who in due time followed in their father’s steps.
And here is terminated the tale of Sultan
Habib and Durrat al-Ghawwas with all
perfection and completion
and good omen.</p>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF HABIB.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">The older translators of this “New Arabian Night” have made wild work
with this Novel at least as the original is given by my text and the edition
of Gauttier (vii. 60–90): in their desire to gallicise it they have invested it with
a toilette purely European and in the worst possible style. Amongst the insipid
details are the division of the Crystalline Islands into the White, Yellow,
Green and Blue; with the Genies Abarikaff, the monstrous Racachik,
Ilbaccaras and Mokilras; and the terrible journey of Habib to Mount Kaf with
his absurd reflections: even the “Roc” cannot come to his aid without “a
damask cushion suspended between its feet by silken cords” for the greater
comfort of the “Arabian Knight.” The Treasury of Solomon, “who fixed the
principles of knowledge by 366 hieroglyphics (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) each of which required a
day’s application from even the ablest understanding, before its mysterious
sense could be understood,” is spun out as if the episode were copy intended for
the daily press. In my text the “Maidens of the Main” are introduced to say
a few words and speed the action. In the French version Ilzaide the elder
becomes a “leading lady,” whose rôle is that of the naïve <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ingénue</span></i>, famous for
“smartness” and “vivacity:” “one cannot refrain from smiling at the lively
sallies of her good nature and simplicity of heart.” I find this young person
the model of a pert, pretty, prattling little French <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soubrette</span></i> who, moreover,
makes open love to “the master.” Habib calls the “good old lady,” his
governess “Esek! Esek!” which in Turk. means donkey, ass. I need hardly
enlarge upon these ineptitudes; those who wish to pursue the subject have
only to compare the two versions.</p>

<p class="c000">At the end of the Frenchified tale we find a note entitled:—“Observations by
the French Editor, on the History of Habib and Dorathil-goase, or the Arabian
Knight,” and these are founded not upon the Oriental text but upon the Occidental
perversion. It is described “from a moral plane rather as a poem than
a simple tale,” and it must be regarded as “a Romance of Chivalry which unites
the two chief characteristics of works of that sort,—amusement and instruction.”
Habib’s education is compared with that of Telemachus, and his being
inured to fatigue is according to the advice of Rousseau “in his Emilius” and
the practice of Robinson Crusoe. Lastly “Grandison is a hero already formed:
Habib is one who needs to be instructed.” I cannot but suspect when reading
all this Western travesty of an Eastern work that M. Cazotte, a typical
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i>, had prepared for caricaturing the unfortunate Habib by carefully
writing up Fénélon, Rousseau, and Richardson; and had grafted his own ideas
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> upon the wild stem of the Arabian novel.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>THE SAY OF HAYKAR THE SAGE (pp. 1–38).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">Haykar’s precepts may be compared advantageously with those of other
nations of the East and West (at a corresponding stage of civilisation) which,
as a rule, follow very similar lines. Many of them find their parallels not only
in Proverbs and Ecclesiastes, as we might reasonably expect, but even in the
Havamál of the Elder Edda, respecting which Thorpe remarks in his translation
(i. p. 36 note): “Odin is the ‘High One.’ The poem is a collection of rules and
maxims, and stories of himself, some of them not very consistent with our ideas
of a supreme deity.” The <em>style</em> of the Icelandic poem, and the manners of the
period when it was composed are of course as wide apart from those of Haykar
as is Iceland from Syria; but human nature remains the same.</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 29–32.—Two classes of subterfuges similar to those employed by Haykar
are common in folk-tales. In one, the hero vanquishes, and generally destroys
his adversary (usually a giant), by imposing on his credulity, like Jack when
he hid himself in a corner of the room, and left a faggot in his bed for the
giant to belabour, and afterwards killed the giant by pretending to rip himself
up, and defying the other to do the same. In other cases, the hero foils his
opponents by subterfuges which are admitted to be just, but which are not
intended actually to deceive, as in the devices by which the blind Shaykh
instructs the merchant to baffle the sharpers, in one of the Sindibad stories
(vol. vi., pp. 202–212, No. 135x., of our Table). In the present story Pharaoh
was baffled by the superior cunning of Haykar, but it is not made quite clear
whether he actually believed in his power to build a castle in the air or not.
However the story probably belongs to the second class.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 32.—Twisting ropes out of sand was a device by which Michael Scot
baffled a devil for whom he had to find constant employment. (Cf. Scott’s
“Lay of the Last Minstrel,” and notes).</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_352">352</span>
  <h3 class="c015"><em>THE HISTORY OF AL-BUNDUKANI (pp. 39–85).</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">I believe the “Robber-Caliph” is sometimes played as a burlesque, for
which it is well adapted. The parallel suggested between the Caliph and a
robber may remind the reader of the interview between Alexander the Great
and the Robber, in “Evenings at Home.” One cannot help sympathising with
the disappointed young Merchant who acted as an informer, and feeling glad that
he got off with a whole skin.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 44. In some versions of this story Harun’s abstention from his bride
for a year is attributed to a previous vow.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 60 and note 1.—This passage, relative to the character of the Caliph may
be compared with his forgetfulness respecting Nur Al-Din Ali and Anis Al-Jalis.
(Vol. ii., p. 42, and note).</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>THE LINGUIST-DAME, THE DUENNA, AND THE KING’S SON (pp. 87–111).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">This story, though much shorter, is very closely paralleled by that of Prince
Calaf and the Princess of China, in the Thousand and One Days (cf. vol. x.,
App. pp. 499, 500). Prince Calaf (the son of the King of the Nogais Tartars) and
his parents are driven from their kingdom by the Sultan of Carizme (Khwárizm),
and take refuge with the Khan of Berlas, where the old King and Queen remain,
while Calaf proceeds to China, where he engages in an intellectual contest with
Princess Tourandocte (Turandot, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> Turándokht, or Turan’s daughter).
When Turandot is on the point of defeat, she sends her confidante, a captive
princess, to Calaf, to worm out his secret (his own name). The confidante, who
is herself in love with Calaf, horrifies him with the invention that Turandot
intends to have him secretly assassinated; but although he drops his name
in his consternation, he refuses to fly with his visitor. In the morning
Turandot declares Calaf’s name to him, but comforts him by saying that she
has nevertheless determined to accept him as her husband, instead of cutting
off his head; and the slave princess commits suicide. Messengers are then
sent for Calaf’s parents, who arrive in company with the friendly Khan who
had granted them an asylum; and Calaf marches against the Sultan of
Carizme, who is defeated and slain, when his subjects readily submit to the
conqueror.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 99.—According to Jewish tradition, the Rod of Moses became transformed
into so terrible a dragon that the Egyptians took to flight, and 60,000 of them
were slain in the press.—(Sale’s Koran, chap. 7, note.)</p>

<p class="c000">P. 99, note 3.—It was long denied that ants store up grain, because our
English ants do not; but it is now well known that many foreign species, some
of which inhabit countries bordering on the Mediterranean (including Palestine)
store up large quantities of grass-seeds in their nests; and one ant found
in North America is said to actually cultivate a particular kind of grass.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 104, note 3.—Those interested in the question of the succession of the
Patriarchs may refer to Joseph Jacobs’ article on “Junior-right in Genesis,”<a id="r431"></a><a href="#f431" class="c011"><sup>[431]</sup></a>
in which the writer argues that it was the original custom among the Hebrews,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_353">353</span>as among other nations, for the youngest son to succeed to his father’s estates,
after the elder ones had already established themselves elsewhere. Much may be
urged in favour of this writer’s conclusions, and it will be remembered that our
own Monarchy was not recognised as hereditary until the time of the Conquest,
the most able or the strongest relative of the late King usually succeeding to the
Crown, and minors being always set aside, unless powerful politicians intended
to use them as mere tools. In the Esthonian Kalevipoeg the system comes out
still more strongly. Three sons are living at home at the time of the death
of Kalev, but the youngest is designated by him as his successor, and is afterwards
indicated by lot as the peculiar favourite of the gods.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 108, note 1—Although it has nothing to do with the present story, yet I
may point out the great importance of the bridle in all the folk-tales which deal
with the transformation of human beings into domestic animals. It is clearly
implied (though not actually expressed) in the story of Julnar the Sea-Born
(No. 153) that the power of Abdallah and Badr Basim over Queen Lab, while
she bore the form of a mule, depended entirely on their keeping possession of
the bridle (Cf. Nights, vol. vii., p. 304, and note). There are many stories
of magicians who transform themselves into horses, &amp;c., for their friends to
sell; but the bridle must on no account be given with the horse. Should this
be neglected (purposely or otherwise) the magician is unable to reassume his
human form at will. (Cf. also Spitta-Bey’s story No. 1 (infrà).)</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>THE TALE OF THE WARLOCK AND THE YOUNG COOK OF BAGHDAD (pp. 119–142.)</em></h3>

<p class="c027">This story appears in Chavis and Cazotte’s version, and in the various translations
made from the French, in a very highly elaborated form, under the title
of “The Adventures of Simoustapha, and the Princess Ilsetilsone.” The Caliph
and his Wazir are identified with Harun Al-Rashid and Ja’afar, but they suffer no
transformations at the hands of the Magician, after whose death Prince Simoustapha
is protected by Setelpedour Ginatille, whose name is interpreted as meaning
the Star of the Seven Seas, though the first name appears rather to be a corruption
of Sitt El Buhúr. She is the queen of Ginnistan, and the daughter of KokopiIesobe
(Satan), whose contests with Mahomet and Michael (the former of whom
continues the conflict by “becoming man”) are described on the approved
Miltonic lines. Her chief councillors are Bahlisboull (Beelzebub) and Asmonchar
(Asmodeus), but ultimately she falls in love with Simoustapha, and adjures her
sovereignty, after which he carries her off, and marries her, upon which the
mother of Ilsetilsone, “the sensible Zobeide formed now a much truer and
more favourable judgment of her daughter’s happiness, since she had shared
the heart of Simoustapha with Setelpedour, and at last agreed that the union of
one man with two women might be productive of great happiness to all the
three, provided that one of the wives happened to be a fairy.” (Weber, ii. p. 50.)
A most encouraging sentiment for would-be polygamists, truly, especially in
Europe, where fairies appear to fly before the advance of civilisation as surely
as the wild beasts of the forest!</p>

<p class="c000">P. 126.—These apparitions resemble those which usually precede the visions
which appear in the well-known pool of ink. But the sweeper is not mentioned
in the present story, nor do I remember reading of his appearing in cases
<span class="pageno" id="Page_354">354</span>of crystal seeing, though Dante Gabriel Rosetti introduces him into his fine
poem, “Rose Mary,” as preparing the way for the visions seen in the beryl:</p>

<p class="c000">P. 132, note.—Apropos of the importance of “three days,” I may refer to
the “three days and three nights” which Christ is commonly said to have passed
in the tomb, and I believe that some mystics assert that three days is the usual
period required by a man to recover consciousness after death.</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 134, 135.—These worked lions recall the exhibition of power, made by
Abu Mohammed hight Lazybones (No. 37; Nights iv., p. 165). Their Oriental
prototypes are probably the lions and eagles with which the Jinn ornamented
the throne of Solomon. In the West, we meet with Southey’s amusing
legend of the Pious Painter:</p>

<p class="c000">The enchanted palaces of the Firm Island, with their prodigies of the Hart
and the Dogs, &amp;c., may also be mentioned (Amadis of Gaul, book II.,
chap. 21, &amp;c.).</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 135, 136.—Stories of changed sex are not uncommon in Eastern and
classical mythology and folk-lore; usually, as in this instance, the change of a
man into a woman, although it is the converse (apparent, of course) which we
meet with occasionally in modern medical books.</p>

<p class="c000">In the Nights, &amp;c., we have the story of the Enchanted Spring (No. 135j) in
the great Sindibad cyclus (Nights, vi., pp. 145–150), and Lane (Modern Egyptians,
chap. xxv.) relates a story which he heard in Cairo more resembling that
of the transformed Wazir. In classical legend we have the stories of Tiresias,
Cæneus, and Iphis. Turning to India, we meet with the prototype of Cæneus
in Amba, who was reincarnated as Sikhandin, in order to avenge herself on
Bhishma, and subsequently exchanged her sex with a Yaksha, and became a
great warrior (Mahabharata Udyoga-Parva, 5942–7057). Some of the versions
of the Enchanted Spring represent the Prince as recovering his sex by an
exchange with a demon, thus showing a transition from the story of Sikhandin
to later replicas. There is also a story of changed sex in the Hindi Baital
Pachisí; and no doubt many others might be quoted.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>HISTORY OF WHAT BEFEL THE FOWL-LET WITH THE FOWLER (pp. 151–164).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">One of the most curious stories relative to the escape of a captured prey is
to be found in the 5th Canto of the Finnish Kalevala. Väinäimöinen, the old
<span class="pageno" id="Page_355">355</span>minstrel, is fishing in the lake where his love, Aino, has drowned herself,
because she would not marry an old man. He hooks a salmon of very
peculiar appearance, and while he is speculating about cutting it up and
cooking it, it leaps from the boat into the water, and then reproaches him
with his folly, telling him that it is Aino (now transformed into a waternymph)
who threw herself in his way to be his life-companion, but that
owing to his folly in proposing to eat her, he has now lost her for ever.
Hereupon she disappears, and all his efforts to rediscover her are fruitless.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>THE TALE OF ATTAF (pp. 165–222).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">P. 178, note 6.—I may add that an episode is inserted in the Europeanised
version of this story, relative to the loves of the son of Chebib and the
Princess of Herak, which is evidently copied from the first nocturnal
meeting of Kamaralzaman and Budur (No. 21, Night iii., pp. 223–242), and is
drawn on exactly similar lines (Weber, i. pp. 508–510).</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>HISTORY OF PRINCE HABIB, AND WHAT BEFEL HIM WITH THE LADY DURRAT AL-GHAWWAS. (pp. 223–261).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">P. 256, note 1.—Epithets of colour, as applied to seas, frequently have a
purely mythological application in Eastern tales. Thus, in the story of Zaher
and Ali (cf. my “New Arabian Nights,” p. 13) we read, “You are now upon
an island of the Black Sea, which encompasses all other seas, and flows
within Mount Kaf. According to the reports of travellers, it is a ten years’
voyage before you arrive at the Blue Sea, and it takes full ten years to traverse
this again to reach the Green Sea, after which there is another ten years’
voyage before you can reach the Greek Sea, which extends to inhabited
countries and islands.”</p>

<p class="c000">Kenealy says (in a note to his poem on “Night”) that the Atlantic Ocean
is called the Sea of Darkness, on account of the great irruption of water
which occasioned its formation; but this is one of his positive statements
relative to facts not generally known to the world, for which he considered it
unnecessary to quote his authority.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 261.—According to one account of impalement which I have seen, the
stake is driven through the flesh of the back beneath the skin.</p>

<p class="c000">Reading the account of the Crucifixion between the lines, I have come to
the conclusion that the sudden death of Christ was due to his drinking from
the sponge which had just been offered to him. The liquid, however, is
said to have been vinegar, and not water; but this might have had the same
effect, or water may have been substituted, perhaps with the connivance of
Pilate. In the latter case vinegar may only have been mentioned as a blind,
to deceive the fanatical Jews. The fragmentary accounts of the Crucifixion
which have come down to us admit of many possible interpretations of details.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>GALLAND’S MS. AND TRANSLATIONS (pp. 465–470).</em></h3>

<p class="c027">P. 468, l. 4 from bottom, Destains’ “Mille et une Nuits,” should be noticed
on p. 472, after l. 2. The full title is as follows:—</p>

<p class="c000"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Les Mille et une Nuits</cite>, Contes Arabes, Traduits en François par Galland,
Nouvelle édition revue sur les textes orientaux et augmentée de plusieurs
nouvelles et contes traduites des langues orientaux, par M. Destains, précédée
d’un notice historique sur Galland par M. Charles Nodier. Paris, 1822.</span></p>

<p class="c000">This edition is in 6 vols. 8vo, and proves to be of no special interest. The
first 5 vols. contain the ordinary version of Galland, and the 6th vol. contains
a selection of tales translated from Scott’s vol. 6, eked out with Chavis and
Cazotte’s Story of Habib. (No. 250 of our Table).</p>

<h3 class="c015"><em>ZOTENBERG’S WORK ON ALADDIN AND ON VARIOUS MANUSCRIPTS OF THE NIGHTS.</em></h3>

<p class="c027">One of the most important works which has appeared lately in connection
with the Thousand and one Nights, is the following:</p>

<p class="c000"><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><cite>Histoire d’ ‘Alâ Al-Dîn ou la Lampe Merveilleuse.</cite> Texte Arabe publié
avec une notice sur quelques manuscrits des Mille et une Nuits par H. Zotenberg,
roy. 8vo, Paris, Imprimérie Nationale, 1888, p., 70.</span></p>

<p class="c000">The publication of this work puts an end to the numerous conjectures of
scholars as to the source of Galland’s unidentified tales; and the notes on
various MSS. of the Nights are also very valuable. It therefore appears
desirable to give a tolerably full sketch of the contents of the book.<a id="r432"></a><a href="#f432" class="c011"><sup>[432]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c000">M. Zotenberg begins with general remarks, and passes on to discuss
Galland’s edition (section 1). Although Galland frequently speaks of Oriental
tales<a id="r433"></a><a href="#f433" class="c011"><sup>[433]</sup></a> in his journal, kept at Constantinople in 1672 and 1673, yet as he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_358">358</span>informs us, in his Dedication to the Marquise d’ O., he only succeeded in
obtaining from Syria a portion of the MS. of the Nights themselves with
considerable difficulty after his return to France.</p>

<p class="c000">There is some doubt as to the date of appearance of the first 6 vols. of
Galland’s “Mille et une Nuit.” According to Caussin de Perceval, vols. 1 and
2 were published together in 1704, and vols. 3 and 4 in the course of the same
year. Nevertheless, in the copy in the Bibliothèque Nationale, vols. 1 and 4
are dated 1704, and vols. 2, 5 and 6 are dated 1705; vol. 3 is missing, just as
we have only odd volumes of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th English editions in the
British Museum, the 1st being still quite unknown.</p>

<p class="c000">M. Zotenberg proceeds to give an account of Galland’s MS. (cf. Nights, x.
App. p. 465), and illustrates it by a specimen page in facsimile. Judging from
the character of the writing, &amp;c., he considers it to have been transcribed about
the second half of the 14th century (Sir R. F. Burton suggests about <span class="fss">A.D.</span> 1384).
It is curious that there is a MS. of the 15th century in the Library of the
Vatican, which appears to be almost a counterpart of Galland’s, and likewise
contains only the first 282 Nights. Galland’s MS. wants a leaf extending from
part of Night 102 to the beginning of Night 104, and containing an account of
the Hunchback and his buffooneries; this hiatus is filled up in the Vatican MS.</p>

<p class="c000">Habìcht’s version is noted as more approaching Galland’s MS. than do the
texts founded on the Egyptian texts; but in thus speaking, Zotenberg does not
notice the assertion that Habìcht’s MS., though obtained at Tunis, came
originally from Egypt. He considers the ordinary Egyptian texts to be
generally abridged and condensed.</p>

<p class="c000">Although it is clear that Galland made great use of this MS. for his translation,
yet M. Zotenberg points out numerous discrepancies, especially those at
the commencement of the work, which led Caussin de Perceval to regard
Galland’s work as a mere paraphrase of the original. M. Zotenberg, however
(p. 14), writes, “Évidemment, Galland, pour la traduction du commencement
du récit, à suivi un texte plus developpé que celui du MS. 1508, texte dont
la rédaction égyptienne ne presente qu’un maladroit abrégé.” He quotes
other instances which seem to show that Galland had more than one text at his
disposal.</p>

<p class="c000">Section II.—At the beginning of the 17th century, only two MS. of the
Nights existed in the libraries of Paris, one in Arabic, and the other in Turkish.
The Arabic MS. contains 870 Nights, and is arbitrarily divided into 29 sections.
M. Zotenberg considers that it was to this MS. that Galland referred, when he
said that the complete work was in 36 parts. The tales follow the order of our
Table as far as No. 7 (Nos. 2ab, 2ac and 3ba are wanting), the remainder are
irregular, and run as follows: 153, 154, 154a, 20; story of Khailedján ibn Hámán,
the Persian; Story of the Two Old Men, and of Báz al-Aschháb Abou Lahab;
9, apparently including as episodes 9a, 9aa, 21, 8, 9b, 170, 181r to 181bb, 137,
154 (commencement repeated), 181u to 181bb (repeated), 135a, Adventures of
a traveller who entered a pond (étang) and underwent metamorphoses:<a id="r434"></a><a href="#f434" class="c011"><sup>[434]</sup></a>
anecdotes and apothegms; a portion of the Kalila and Dimna?</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_359">359</span>The Turkish MS. (in 11 vols.) is made up of several imperfect copies,
which have been improperly put together. The bulk is formed by vols. 2–10
which are written in three different hands, and some of which bear date 1046
A.H. The contents of these nine vols. are as follows: Introduction and 1–3,
(wanting 2ab); Story of ’Abdallah of Basra; 5; Story of ’Attáf ibn Ismá’il al-Schoqláni
of Damascus and the schaikh Abou-’l-Baraka al-Nawwám, 6; Story
told by the Christian Merchant (relating to Qamar al-Zamán) during the reign of
Sultan Mahmoud, and different from the story known under this title; Story
of Ahmad al-Saghir (the little) and Schams al-Qosour; Story of the Young Man
of Baghdad and the Bathman (Baigneur, attendant in a Hammám), 7; 153,
21; Story of Khaledjan ibn Maháni; Story of <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">سنمنح</span> and <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">غوثان</span> (or <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">غوثبان</span>);
Story of Nour al-Din ‘Ali and of Dounya (or Dinar) of Damascus, 133; Story
of Prince Qamar-Khan and of the schaikh ’Ata, of the Sultan Mahmoud-Khán,
of Bahrám-Scháh, of ’Abdallah ibn Hilal, of Harout and Marout, &amp;c.; Story of
Qowwat al-Qoloub; 9, including as episodes 9a; 8; Story of Moubaref who
slept in the bath; (? = 96); and 170; Fables.</p>

<p class="c000">The other volumes (1 and 11 of the MS.) both contain the beginning of the
MS. Vol. 1 was written towards the end of the 17th century, and extends
about as far Night 55, concluding with No. 7, which follows No. 3. Vol. 11., which
once belonged to Galland, includes only a portion of the Introduction. The
text of these two fragments is similar, but differs considerably from that
of vol. 2 of the MS.; and specimens of the commencement of vols. 1 and 2 are
given to shew this. Yet it is singular that Galland does not seem to have used
these Turkish volumes; and the second MS. which he actually used, like the
4th vol. of the copy preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale, appears to be
missing.</p>

<p class="c000">M. Zotenberg then remarks on the missing vol. 4 of Galland, and quotes
extracts from Galland’s Diary, shewing that Nos. 191, 192 and 192a, which
were surreptitiously introduced into his work without his knowledge, and
greatly to his annoyance, were translated by Petis de la Croix, and were
probably intended to be included in the Thousand and One Days, which was
published in 1710. “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comme la plupart de ces contes, ils sont tirés de l’ouvrage
turc intitulé <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">الفرج بعد الشدة</span>, dont ils forment le 6<sup>e</sup>, le 8<sup>e</sup> et le 9<sup>e</sup> récit.</span>” (Zotenberg,
p. 27.)</p>

<p class="c000">Then follows Section iii., one of the most important in the book, in which
extracts from Galland’s Diary of 1709 are quoted, shewing that he was then in
constant communication with a Christian Maronite of Aleppo, named Hanna
(Jean), who was brought to Paris by the traveller Paul Lucas, and who related
stories to Galland, of which the latter took copious notes, and most of which he
worked up into the later volumes of his “Mille et une Nuit” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>). Among these
were 193, 194a, 194b, 59, 197, 198, 174, 195, 194c, 196. The following tales he
did not use: An Arab story of two cousins, Camar eddin and Bedr el Bodour;
the Golden City (another version of the story of the Three Princes, in No. 198,
combined with the story of the woman who slew pretenders who were unable to
solve a riddle); The Three Princes, the Genius Morhagian, and his Daughters;
and the story of the seller of ptisanne (or diet-drinks) and his son Hassan.</p>

<p class="c000">Further extracts from Galland’s Diary are added, extending from the time
of Hanna’s departure from Paris between June and October, 1709, and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_360">360</span>completion of the 12th volume of the Mille et une Nuit in 1712. These relate
to the gradual progress of the work; and to business in connection with it; and
Hanna’s name is occasionally mentioned.</p>

<p class="c000">Hanna supplied Galland with a written version of No. 193, and probably of
194 a-c; (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> most of the tales in vols. 9 and 10); but the tales in vols. 11 and
12 were apparently edited by Galland from his notes and recollections of
Hanna’s narrations. These are Nos. 195, 196, 59, 197 and 198. M. Zotenberg
concludes that Hanna possessed a MS. containing all these tales, part of which
he copied for Galland, and that this copy, like several other important volumes
which Galland is known or believed to have possessed, was lost. M. Zotenberg
thinks that we may expect to meet with most of Hanna’s tales either in other
copies of the Nights, or in some other collection of the same kind. The latter
supposition appears to me to be by far the most probable.</p>

<p class="c000">[Section IV.]—M. Zotenberg proceeds to give an account of one or two
very important MSS. of the Nights in the Bibliothèque Nationale. One of
these is a MS. which belonged to the elder Caussin, and was carefully copied
by Michael Sabbagh from a MS. of Baghdad. Prof. Fleischer, who examined
it, states (Journal Asiatique, 1827, t. II., p. 221) that it follows the text of
Habicht, but in a more developed form. M. Zotenberg copies a note at the end,
finishing up with the word <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">كبيكج</span> (Kabíkaj) thrice repeated. This, he explains,
“est le nom du génie préposé au régne des insectes. Les scribes, parfois,
l’invoquent pour preserver leurs manuscrits de l’atteinte de vers.”</p>

<p class="c000">This MS. was copied at Paris on European paper at the beginning of the
century, though Caussin de Perceval was not acquainted with it in 1806, but only
with a MS. of the Egyptian redaction. This MS. agrees with Galland’s only as
far as the 69th Night. It differs from it in two other points; it contains No. 1c.
and the end of No. 3 coincides with the end of Night 69. The contents of
Nights 70–1001 are as follows: 246, 4, 5, 6, 20, 7, 153, 21, 170, 247, The Unhappy
Lover confined in the Madhouse (probably = 204c), 8, 191, 193, 174, 9, 9b (not 9a,
or 9aa) and as episodes, 155, 32, and the story of the two brothers ’Amír and
Ghadir, and their children Djamil and Bathina.</p>

<p class="c000">Another MS., used by Chavis and Cazotte, and Caussin de Perceval, was
written in the year 1772. It has hitherto been overlooked, because it was
erroneously stated in the late M. Reinaud’s Catalogue to be a MS. containing
part of the 1001 Nights, extending from Night 282 to Night 631, and copied
by Chavis. It is not from Chavis’ hand, and does not form part of the
ordinary version of the Nights, but contains the following tales: 174, 248, Story
of King Sapor, 246, 3a, 36, 3c, 153, Story of the Intendant, the Interpreter,
and the Young Man; 247, 204c, 240, 250, Story of the Caliph and the Fisherman,
(probably = 156); the Cat and the Fox, and the Little Bird and the
Fowler.</p>

<p class="c000">Another MS., really written by Chavis, commences exactly where Vol. 3
of Galland’s MS. leaves off; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> in the middle of No. 21, and extends from
Night 281 to Night 631. M. Zotenberg supposes it to have been written to
supply the place of the last volume of Galland’s set. It contains the following
tales, in addition to the conclusion of No. 21: 170, 247, 204c, 8, 191, 193 and
174. M. Zotenberg suggests that the first part of this MS. may have been
copied from Galland’s last volume, which may have existed at the time in
private hands.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_361">361</span>The two last MSS. contain nearly the same tales, though with numerous
variations. M. Zotenberg discusses the hypothesis of Chavis’ MS. being a
translation from the French, and definitely rejects it.</p>

<p class="c000">[Section V.]—Here M. Zotenberg discusses the MSS. of the Nights in
general, and divides them into three categories. I. MSS. proceeding from
Muslim parts of Asia. These, except the MSS. of Michael Sabbagh and
that of Chavis, contain only the first part of the work. They are all more or
less incomplete, and stop short in the middle of the text. They are not quite
uniform, especially in their readings, but generally contain the same tales
arranged in the same order. II. Recent MSS. of Egyptian origin, characterised
by a special style, and a more condensed narrative; by the nature and
arrangement of the tales; by a great number of anecdotes and fables; and by
the early part of the work containing the great romance of chivalry of King
Omar Bin Al-Nu’uman. III. MSS. mostly of Egyptian origin, differing
as much among themselves in the arrangement of the tales, as do those of the
other groups.</p>

<p class="c000">The following MSS. are mentioned as belonging to the first group:—</p>

<p class="c012">I. Galland’s MS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Nos. 1506–1508.</p>

<p class="c012">II. MS. in the Vatican, No. 782.</p>

<p class="c012">III. Dr. Russell’s MS. from Aleppo.</p>

<p class="c012">IV. MS. in the Bibl. Nat. (Suppl. 1715, I. and II.).</p>

<p class="c012">V. MS. in the Library of Christ Church College, Oxford (No. ccvii.).</p>

<p class="c012">VI. MS. in the Library of the India Office, London (No. 2699).</p>

<p class="c012">VII. Sir W. Jones’ MS., used by Richardson.</p>

<p class="c012">VIII. Rich’s MS. in the Library of the British Museum (Addit. 7404).</p>

<p class="c012">IX. MS. in Bibl. Nat. (Suppl. 2522 and 2523).</p>

<p class="c012">X. MS. in Bibl. Nat. (Suppl. 1716).</p>

<p class="c000">The following MSS. are enumerated as belonging to the second group:—</p>

<p class="c012">I. Salt’s MS. (printed in Calcutta in 4 vols).</p>

<p class="c012">II.-IV. Three complete MSS. in Bibliothèque Nationale (Suppl. Arabe, Nos.
1717, 1718, 1719).</p>

<p class="c012">V. Incomplete MS. of Vol. II. in Bibl. Nat. (Suppl. Arabe, Nos. 2198 to
2200).</p>

<p class="c012">VI. Incomplete MS. of Vol. 4 (Suppl. Arabe, Nos. 2519 to 2521).</p>

<p class="c012">VII. Odd vol. containing Nights 656 to 1001 (Suppl. Arabe, No. 1721, III).</p>

<p class="c012">XII. MS. containing Nights 284 to 327. (Suppl. Arabe, No. 1720.)</p>

<p class="c012">XIII. MS. in British Museum (Oriental MSS., Nos. 1593 to 1598).</p>

<p class="c012">XIV. Ditto, (Oriental MSS., Nos. 2916 to 2919).</p>

<p class="c012">XV. Burckhardt’s MS. in the University Library at Cambridge (B. MSS.
106 to 109).</p>

<p class="c012">XVI. MS. in the Vatican (Nos. 778 to 781).</p>

<p class="c012">XVII. MS. in the Ducal Library at Gotha.</p>

<p class="c012">XVIII. Odd vol. in ditto.</p>

<p class="c012"><span class="pageno" id="Page_362">362</span>XIX. MS. in the Royal Library at Munich.</p>

<p class="c012">XX. Ditto, incomplete (De Sacy’s).</p>

<p class="c012">XXI. Fragment in the Library of the Royal and Imperial Library at
Vienna (No. CL.).</p>

<p class="c012">XXII. MS. in the Imperial Public Library at St. Petersburg (Von
Hammer’s).</p>

<p class="c012">XXV. Caussin de Perceval’s MS</p>

<p class="c012">XXVI. Sir W. Ouseley’s MSS.</p>

<p class="c000">The above list does not include copies or fragments in various libraries of
which M. Zotenberg has no sufficient information, nor miscellaneous collections
in which tales from the Nights are mixed with others.</p>

<p class="c000">Portions of Habicht’s MS. appear to belong to the Egyptian recension, and
others to have come from further East.</p>

<p class="c000">There is a MS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale (Suppl. Arabe, No. 1721, IV.)
from Egypt, containing the first 210 Nights, which somewhat resembles
Habicht’s MS. both in style and in the arrangement of the tales. The Third
Shaykh’s Story (No. 1 c.) is entirely different from those in the ordinary MSS.,
nor is it the same as that in the Turkish version of the Nights, which is again
quite different from either. In this MS. (No. 1721, IV.) No. 6 is followed by
Nos. 7, 174, and 133.</p>

<p class="c000">Then follow notices of Anderson’s MS., used by Scott, but which cannot
now be traced; the Calcutta edition of the first 200 Nights; and of the Wortley
Montague MS. These form M. Zotenberg’s third group of MSS.</p>

<p class="c000">M. Zotenberg does not enter into the question of the original form, date
and constituents of the primitive work, but concludes that the complete work
as we now have it, only assumed its present form at a comparatively recent
period. But it must not be forgotten that the details, description, manners,
and style of the tales composing this vast collection, are undergoing daily
alteration both from narrators and copyists.</p>

<p class="c000">Then follows an Appendix, in which M. Zotenberg has copied two tales
from Galland’s journals, which he took down as related by the Maronite
Hanna. One of these is new to me; it is the story of the Three Princes, and
the Genius Morhagian and his Daughters (added at the end of this section);
and the other is the well-known story of the Envious Sisters.</p>

<p class="c000">The remainder of M. Zotenberg’s volume contains the Arabic text of the
story of ’Ala Al-Din, or the Wonderful Lamp, with numerous critical notes,
most of which refer to Galland’s version. A few pages of Chavis’ text are
added for comparison.</p>

<p class="c000">The story itself, M. Zotenberg remarks, is modern, giving a faithful picture
of Egyptian manners under the reign of the last Mamlouk Sultans. Some
expressions which occur in the French-Arabic Dictionary of Ellions Bocthor
and of A. Caussin de Perceval, are apparently derived from the story of
’Ala Al-Din.</p>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>STORY OF THE THREE PRINCES AND THE GENIUS MORHAGIAN AND HIS DAUGHTERS.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c016">[Reprinted by M. Zotenberg (pp. 53–61) from Galland’s Journal, MS. français,
No. 15277, pp. 120–131.] The passages in brackets are added by the present translator
(chiefly where Galland has inserted “etc.”) to fill up the sense.</p>

<p class="c000">When the Sultan of Samarcand had reached a great age, he called the three
princes, his sons, and after observing that he was much pleased to see how
much they loved and revered him, he gave them leave to ask for whatever they
most desired. They had only to speak, and he was ready to grant them whatever
they asked, let it be what it might, on the sole condition that he should
satisfy the eldest first, and the two younger ones afterwards, each in his turn.
The eldest prince, whose name was Rostam, begged the Sultan to build him a
cabinet of bricks of gold and silver alternately, and roofed with all kinds of
precious stones.</p>

<p class="c000">The Sultan issued his orders that very day, but before the roof of the cabinet
was finished, indeed before any furniture had been put into it, Prince Rostam
asked his father’s leave to sleep there. The Sultan tried to dissuade him,
saying that [the roof] ought to be finished first; but the prince was so impatient
that he ordered his bed to be removed there, and he lay down. He was
reading the Koran about midnight, when suddenly the floor opened and he
beheld a most hideous genius named Morhagian rise from the ground, who
cried out, “You are a prince, but even if you were the Sultan himself, I would
not refrain from taking vengeance for your rashness in entering this house
which has been built just above the palace of my eldest daughter.” At the
same time he paced around the cabinet, and struck its walls, when the whole
cabinet was reduced to dust so fine that the wind carried it away, and left not a
trace of it. The prince drew his sword, and pursued the genius, who took to
flight until he came to a well, into which he plunged [and vanished]. When
the prince appeared before his father the Sultan next morning, he was overwhelmed
with confusion [not only at what had happened, but on account of his
disobedience to his father, who reproached him severely for having disregarded
his advice.]</p>

<p class="c000">The second prince, whose name was Gaiath Eddin (Ghayáth al-Dín), then requested
the Sultan to build him a cabinet constructed entirely of the bones of
fishes. The Sultan ordered it to be built, at great expense. Prince Gaiath Eddin
had no more patience to wait till it was quite finished than his brother Rostam.
He lay down in the cabinet, notwithstanding the Sultan’s warnings, but took care
to keep his sword by his side. The genius Morhagian appeared to him also at
midnight, paid him the same compliment, and told him that the cabinet was built
over the palace of his second daughter. He reduced it to dust, and Prince Gaiath
Eddin pursued him, sword in hand, to the well, where he escaped; and next day
the prince appeared before his father, the Sultan [as crestfallen as his brother].</p>

<p class="c000">The third prince, who was named Badialzaman (Badíu ’l-Zamán = Rarity
of the Age), obtained leave from the Sultan to build a cabinet entirely of rock
crystal. He went to sleep there before it was entirely finished, but without saying
anything to the Sultan, as he was resolved to see whether Morhagian would
treat him in the same way. Morhagian arrived at midnight, and declared that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_364">364</span>the cabinet was built over the palace of his third daughter. He destroyed the
cabinet, and when the prince seized his sword, Morhagian took to flight.
The prince wounded him three times before he reached the well, but he nevertheless
succeeded in escaping.</p>

<p class="c000">Prince Badialzaman did not present himself to the Sultan, but went to the
two princes, his brothers, and urged them to pursue the genius in the well itself.
The three went together, and the eldest was let down into the well by a rope,
but after descending a certain distance, he cried out, and asked to be drawn up
again. He excused his failure by saying that he felt a burning heat [and was
almost suffocated]. The same thing happened to Prince Gaiath Eddin, who likewise
cried out till he was drawn up. Prince Badialzaman then had himself let
down but commanded his brothers not to draw him up again, even if he should cry
out. They let him down, and he cried out, but he continued to descend till he
reached the bottom of the well, when he untied himself from the rope, and called
out to his brothers that the air was very foul. At the bottom of the well he
found an open door, and he advanced for some distance between two walls, at
the end of which he found a golden door, which he opened, and beheld a
magnificent palace. He entered and passed through the kitchen and the storerooms,
which were filled with all kinds of provisions, and then inspected the
rooms, when he entered one magnificently furnished with sofas and divans.
He was curious to find out who lived there, so he hid himself. Soon afterwards
he beheld a flight of doves alight at the edge of a basin of water in the middle
of the court. The doves plunged into the water, and emerged from it as
women, each of whom immediately set about her appointed work. One went
to the store room, another to the kitchen, a third began to sweep [and so on].
They prepared a feast [as if for expected guests]. Some time afterwards,
Badialzaman beheld another flight of ten doves of different colours, who
surrounded an eleventh, which was quite white, and these also perched on the
edge of the basin. The ten doves plunged into the basin and came forth as
women, more beautiful than the first and more magnificently robed. They
took the white dove and plunged her into a smaller basin, which was [filled
with] rose [water] and she became a woman of extraordinary beauty. She
was the eldest daughter of the genius, and her name was Fattane. (Fattánah
 = The Temptress.)</p>

<p class="c000">Two of her attendants then took Fattane under the armpits, and led her to
her apartment, followed by the others. She took her seat on a small raised
sofa, and her women separated, some to the right and some to the left, and set
about their work. Prince Badialzaman had dropped his handkerchief. One of
the waiting women saw it and picked it up, and when she looked round, she
saw the prince. She was alarmed, and warned Fattane, who sent some of her
women to see who the stranger was. The prince came forward, and presented
himself before Fattane, who beheld a young prince, and gave him a most
gracious reception. She made him sit next to her, and inquired what brought
him there? He told his story from the beginning to the end, and asked where
he could find the genius, on whom he wished to take vengeance. Fattane
smiled, and told him to think no more about it, but only to enjoy himself in the
good company in which he found himself. They spread the table, and she made
him sit next to her, and her women played on all kinds of musical instruments
before they retired to rest.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_365">365</span>Fattane persuaded the prince to stay with her from day to day: but on the
fortieth day he declared that he could wait no longer, and that it was absolutely
necessary for him to find out where Morhagian dwelt. The princess acknowledged
that he was her father, and told him that his strength was so great [that
nobody could overcome him]. She added that she could not inform him
where to find him, but that her second sister would tell him. She sent one of
her women to guide him to her sister’s palace through a door of communication,
and to introduce him. He was well received by the fairy, for whom he had a
letter, and he found her younger and more beautiful than Fattane. He begged
her to inform him where he could find the genius, but she changed the subject
of conversation, entertained him magnificently, and kept him with her for
forty days. On the fortieth day she permitted him to depart, gave him a letter,
and sent him to her youngest sister, who was a still more beautiful fairy. He
was received and welcomed with joy. She promised to show him Morhagian’s
dwelling, and she also entertained him for forty days. On the fortieth day she
tried to dissuade him from his enterprise, but he insisted. She told him that
Morhagian would grasp his head in one hand, and his feet in the other, and
would tear him asunder in the middle. But this did not move him, and she
then told him that he would find Morhagian in a dwelling, long, high and wide
in proportion to his bulk. The prince sought him out, and the moment he
caught sight of him, he rushed at him, sword in hand. Morhagian stretched
out his hand, seized his head in one hand and his feet in the other, rent him in
two with very little effort, and threw him out of a window which overlooked a
garden.</p>

<p class="c000">Two women sent by the youngest princess each took a piece of the body of
the prince, and brought it to their mistress, who put them together, reunited
them, and restored life to the prince by applying water [of life?] to the wounds.
She then asked the prince where he came from, and it seemed to him that he had
just awakened from sleep; and she then recalled everything to his recollection.
But this did not weaken his firm resolve to kill the genius. The fairy begged
him to eat, but he refused; and she then urged that Morhagian was her father,
and that he could only be killed by his own sword, which the prince could not
obtain.<a id="r435"></a><a href="#f435" class="c011"><sup>[435]</sup></a> “You may say what you please,” answered the prince; “but there is
no help for it, and he must die by my hand [to atone for the wrongs which my
brothers and I have suffered from him].”</p>

<p class="c000">Then the princess made him swear solemnly to take her as his bride, and
taught him how he might succeed in killing the genius. “You cannot hope to
kill him while he wakes,” said she, “but when he sleeps it is not quite impossible.
If he sleeps, you will hear him snore, but he will sleep with his eyes
open, which is a sign that he has fallen into a very profound slumber. As he
fills the whole room, step upon him and seize his sword which hangs above his
head, and then strike him on the neck. The blow will not kill him, but as he
wakes, he will tell you to strike him a second time. But beware of doing this,
[for if you strike him again, the wound will heal of itself, and he will spring up
and kill you, and me after you].”</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_366">366</span>Then Badialzaman returned to Morhagian’s room, and found him snoring
so loud that everything around him shook. The prince entered, though not
without trembling, and walked over him till he was able to seize the sword
when he struck him a violent blow on the neck. Morhagian awoke, cursing his
daughter, and cried out to the prince, whom he recognised, “Make an end of
me.” The prince answered that what he had done was enough, and he left him,
and Morhagian died.</p>

<p class="c000">The prince carried off Morhagian’s sword, which he thought would be useful
to him in other encounters; and as he went, he passed a magnificent stable in
which he saw a splendid horse. He returned to the fairy and related to her
what he had done, and added that he would like to carry off the horse, but he
feared it would be very difficult. “Not so difficult as you think,” said she.
“Go and cut off some hair from his tail, and take care of it, and whenever you
are in need, burn one or two of the hairs, and he will be with you immediately
[and will bring you whatever you require].”</p>

<p class="c000">After this the three fairies assembled together, and the prince promised that
the two princes, his brothers, should marry the other two sisters. Each fairy
reduced her palace to the size of a small ball, which she gave to the prince.</p>

<p class="c000">The prince then took the three fairies to the bottom of the well. His father,
the Sultan, had long believed that he was dead, and had put on mourning for
him. His two brothers often came to the well, and they happened to be there
just at the time. Badialzaman attracted their attention by his shouts, told
them what had happened, and added that he had brought the three fairies
with him. He asked for a rope and fastened the eldest fairy to it, calling out,
“Pull away, Prince Rostam, I send you your good fortune.” The rope was
let down again, and he fastened the second fairy to it, calling out “Brother
Gaiath Eddin, pull up your good fortune too.”</p>

<p class="c000">The third fairy, who was to marry Badialzaman, begged him to allow himself
to be drawn up before her [as she was distrustful of his brothers], but he
would not listen to her. As soon as the two princes had drawn her up so high
that they could see her, they began to dispute who should have her. Then the
fairy cried out to Badialzaman, “Prince, did I not warn you of this?”</p>

<p class="c000">The princes were obliged to agree that the Sultan should settle their dispute.
When the third fairy had been drawn out of the well, the three fairies
endeavoured to persuade the two princes to draw up their youngest brother,
but they refused, and compelled them to follow them. While they carried off
the youngest princess, the other two asked leave to say adieu to prince Badialzaman.
They cried out from the top of the well, “Prince, have patience till
Friday, when you will see six bulls pass by—three red ones and three black ones.
Mount upon one of the red ones and he will bring you up to the earth, but
take good care not to mount upon a black one, for he would carry you down to
the Seventh Earth.”<a id="r436"></a><a href="#f436" class="c011"><sup>[436]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c000">The princes carried off the three fairies, and on Friday, three days afterwards,
the six bulls appeared. Badialzaman was about to mount upon a red
one, when a black one prevented him, and compelled him to mount his back,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_367">367</span>when he plunged through the earth till he stopped at a large town in another
world. He entered the town, and took up his abode with an old woman, to
whom he gave a piece of gold to provide him with something to eat, for he was
almost famished. When he had eaten enough, he asked for something to
drink. “You cannot be a native of this country,” said the old woman [“or you
would not ask for drink”]. She then brought him a sponge, saying that she had
no other water. She then informed him that the town was supplied with water
from a very copious spring, the flow of which was interrupted by a monster.
They were obliged to offer up a girl to be devoured by it on every Friday.
To-day the princess, the Sultan’s daughter, was to be given up to him, and
while the monster emerged from his lair to devour her, enough water would
flow for everyone to supply himself until the following Friday.</p>

<p class="c000">Badialzaman then requested the old woman to show him the way to the
place where the princess was already exposed; but she was so much afraid
that he had much trouble in persuading her to come out of her house to show
him what direction to take. He went out of the town, and went on till he saw
the princess who made a sign to him from a distance to approach no nearer;
and the nearer he came, the more anxiety she displayed. As soon as he was
within hearing, he shouted to her not to be afraid; and he sat down beside
her, and fell asleep, after having begged her to wake him as soon as the monster
appeared. Presently a tear from the princess fell upon his face, and he woke
up, and saw the monster, which he slew with the sword of Morhagian, and the
water flowed in abundance. The princess thanked her deliverer, and begged
him to take her back to the Sultan her father, who would give proofs of his
gratitude; but he excused himself. She then marked his shoulder with the
blood of the monster without his noticing it. The princess then returned to
the town, and was led back to the palace, where she related to the Sultan [all
that had happened]. Then the Sultan commanded that all the men in the
town should pass before himself and the princess under pain of death. Badialzaman
tried to conceal himself in a khan, but he was compelled to come with
the others. The princess recognised him, and threw an apple at him to point
him out. He was seized, and brought before the Sultan, who demanded what
he could do to serve him. The prince hesitated, but at length he requested the
Sultan to show him the way to return to the world from whence he came. The
Sultan was furious, and would have ordered him to be burned as a heretic [but
the princess interceded for his life]. The Sultan then treated him as a madman,
and drove him ignominiously from the town, and he wandered away without
knowing where he was going. At length he arrived at a mountain of rock,
where he saw a great serpent rising from his lair to prey on young Rokhs. He
slew the serpent with the sword of Morhagian, and the father and mother of the
Rokhs arrived at the moment, and asked him to demand whatever he desired in
return. He hesitated awhile, but at length he asked them to show him the way
to the upper world. The male Rokh then told him to prepare ten quarters of
mutton, to mount on his back, and to give him some of the meat whenever he
should turn his head either to one side or to the other on the journey.</p>

<p class="c000">The prince mounted on the back of the Rokh, the Rokh stamped with his
foot, and the earth opened before them wherever he turned. They reached
the bottom of the well when the Rokh turned his head, but there was no more
meat left, so the prince cut off the calf of his leg, and give it to him. When
<span class="pageno" id="Page_368">368</span>the Rokh arrived at the top of the well, the prince leaped to the ground, when
the Rokh perceived [that he was lame, when he inquired the reason, and the
prince explained what had happened]. The Rokh then disgorged the calf of the
leg, and returned it to its place, when it grew fast, and the prince was cured
immediately.</p>

<p class="c000">As the prince left the well, he met a peasant, and changed clothes with him,
but he kept the sword, the three balls, and the horse-hair. He went into the
town, where he took lodgings with a tailor, and kept himself in retirement.
The prince gradually rose in the tailor’s esteem by letting him perceive that he
knew how to sew, [and all the arts of an accomplished tailor]. Presently, preparations
were made for the wedding of Prince Rostam, and the tailor with whom
Badialzaman lodged was ordered to prepare the fairy’s robes. Badialzaman, who
slept in the shop, took clothes from one of the balls similar to those which
were already far advanced, and put them in the place of the others. The tailor
was astonished [at their fine workmanship] and wished to take the prince with
him to receive a present, but he refused, alleging as an excuse that he had so
lately come to the town. When the fairies saw the clothes, they thought it a
good omen.</p>

<p class="c000">The wedding day arrived, and they threw the jaríd,<a id="r437"></a><a href="#f437" class="c011"><sup>[437]</sup></a> [and practised other
martial exercises]. It was a grand festival, and all the shops were closed. The
tailor wished to take the prince to see the spectacle, but he put him off with an
excuse. However, he went to a retired part of the town, where he struck fire
with a gun,<a id="r438"></a><a href="#f438" class="c011"><sup>[438]</sup></a> and burned a little of the horse-hair. The horse appeared, and
he told him to bring him a complete outfit all in red, and that he should likewise
appear with trappings, jewels &amp;c., and a reed (jaríd) of the same colour. The
prince then mounted the horse, and proceeded to the race-course, where his
appearance excited general admiration. At the close of the sports, he cut off
the head of Prince Rostam, and the horsemen pursued him, but were unable to
overtake him, and soon lost sight of him. He returned to the shop dressed as
usual before the arrival of the tailor, who related to him what had happened, of
which he pretended to be entirely ignorant. There was a great mourning at the
court; but three months afterwards, fresh robes were ordered for the wedding of
the second prince. The fairies were confirmed in their suspicions when they
saw the fresh clothes [which Badialzaman sent them].</p>

<p class="c000">On the wedding day they again assembled to throw the jaríd. Prince
Badialzaman now presented himself on the white horse, robed in white, and
with pearls and jewels to match, and again he attracted general admiration.
He pushed himself into the midst of a guard of eight hundred horsemen, and
slew Gaiath Eddin. They rushed upon him, and he allowed himself to be
carried before the Sultan, who recognised him, [and pronounced his decision],
“A brother who has been abandoned to die by his brothers, has a right to kill
them.”</p>

<p class="c000">After this, Prince Badialzaman espoused the youngest princess, and the
two others were given in marriage to two princes who were related to the
Sultan.</p>

Oriental or otherwise.</p>

<p class="c000">Jésus-Christ et la femme infidèle. (=261 b.; cf. Nights x., p. 473.)</p>

<p class="c000">Le Roitelet. This is the fable of the Ox and the Frog.</p>

<p class="c000">L’idiot et le coucou (=No. 206a.)</p>

<p class="c000">Moh’amed ben Soltan. This is one of the class of stories known to folklorists
as the Punchkin series. The life of a Ghúl is hidden in an egg, the egg
in a pigeon, the pigeon in a camel, and the camel in the sea.</p>

<p class="c000">Les deux Frères. A Cinderella story. The slayer of a hydra is discovered

<p class="c000">Les trois Frères. Here a Ghúl is killed by a single blow from a magic
dagger, which must not be repeated. (Cf. antea, p. 365; and Nights, vii. p. 361.)
In this story, too, the protection of a Ghúlah is secured by tasting her milk, a
point which we find in Spitta Bey’s “Contes Arabes Modernes,” but not in the
Nights.</p>

<p class="c000">This book contains 12 orally collected tales of such great importance from a
folk-lore point of view that I have given full abstracts of all. They are designed
to illustrate the spoken Egyptian dialect, and are printed in Roman character,
with translation and glossary. The hero of nearly all the tales is called
“Mohammed l’Avisé,” which Mr. Sydney Hartland renders “Prudent,” and
Mr. W. A. Clouston “Discreet.” The original gives “Essâtir Mehammed.” (Al-Shátir
Mohammed, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>, M. the Clever) The frequent occurrence of the number
39 (forty less one) may also be noted. Ghúls often play the part which we
should expect Jinn to fill. The bear which occurs in two stories, is not an
Egyptian animal. Having called attention to these general features we may
leave the tales to speak for themselves.</p>

<h4 class="c032">I. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Mohammed l’Avisé.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">Contains the essential features of Cazotte’s story of the Maugraby, (cf.
Nights, x., p. 471) with interesting additions. The “Mogrébin” confers three
sons on a king and queen, and claims Mohammed, the eldest and the cleverest.
He gives him a book to read during his absence of 30 days, but on the 29th
day he finds a girl hanging by her hair in the garden, and she teaches him to
read it, but not to tell the magician. The latter cuts off his arm, threatening to
cut off his head if he cannot read the book within another 30 days. As soon as
he is gone, Mohammed reads on his arm again with the book, and escapes with
the girl, when they separate and return to their respective homes. Mohammed
then changes himself into a sheep for his mother to sell, but warns her not to
sell the cord round his neck. Next day he changes himself into a camel, forbidding
his mother to sell the bridle; but she is persuaded to do so, and he falls
into the hands of the magician. But he contrives to escape in the form of a
crow and the magician pursues him for two days and nights in the form of a
hawk, when he descends into the garden of the king whose daughter he had
rescued from the magician, and changes himself into a pomegranate on a tree.
The magician asks for and receives the pomegranate, when it bursts, and the
seed containing the life of Mohammed rolls under the king’s throne. The
magician changes himself into a cock, and picks up the seeds, but while he is
searching for the last, it changes into a dagger, and cuts him in two. The
princess acknowledges Mohammed as her deliverer, and they are married.</p>

  <h4 class="c032">II. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de l’Ours de Cuisine.</span></i></h4>
</div>

<p class="c027">This begins as a swan-maiden story.<a id="r440"></a><a href="#f440" class="c011"><sup>[440]</sup></a> A king steals the feather-dress of a
bathing maiden, who will only marry him on condition that she shall tear out
the eyes of his forty women (39 white slaves and a princess). The king answers,
“C’est bien, il n’y a pas d’inconvénient.” The forty blind women are shut up
in a room under the kitchen, where they give birth to children whom they cut
up and divide; but the princess saves her shares and thus preserves her son,
whom she calls “Mohammed l’Avisé,” and teaches to read. He steals
food from the kitchen, calling himself “Ours de Cuisine;” the queen hears of
him, pretends to be ill, and demands that he shall be sent to fetch the heart of
the Bull of the Black Valley. He finds a Ghúleh sitting with her breasts thrown
back on her shoulders, so he tastes her milk unperceived, and she at once
adopts him as her son. She gives him a ball and a dagger, warning him that
if he strikes the bull more than once, he will sink into the earth with him. The
ball rolls before him, and when it stops, the bull rises from the ground.
Mohammed kills him, refusing to repeat the blow, returns the ball and dagger
to the Ghúleh, and returns home. A few days afterwards, the queen sends
Mohammed to fetch the heart of the Bull of the Red Valley, and when he
informs the Ghúleh, she says, “Does she wish to kill her second brother too?”
“Are these her brothers?” asked Mohammed. She answered, “Yes, indeed, they
are the sons of the Sultan of the Jánn.” He kills the Bull as before. A fortnight
afterwards, the queen hides a loaf of dry bread under her mattress, when its
cracking gives rise to the idea that she is very ill, and she complains of great
pain in the sides. She demands a pomegranate from the White Valley, where
the pomegranates grow to the weight of half a cantar.<a id="r441"></a><a href="#f441" class="c011"><sup>[441]</sup></a> The Ghúleh tells him
she cannot help him, but he must wait for her son Abderrahym. When he
arrives he remarks, “Hum! mother, there’s a smell of man about you, bring
him here to me to eat for breakfast.” But his mother introduces Mohammed
to him as his foster brother, and he becomes friendly at once, but says that the
pomegranate is the queen’s sister. He tells Mohammed to get an ardebb of
small round loaves in a basket, along with a piece of meat, and a piece of liver.
The Ghúl then gives him a rod, saying, “Throw it down, and walk after it.
It will knock at the garden gate, which will open, and when you enter you
will find great dogs, but throw the bread right and left, without looking back.
Beyond a second gate you will find Ghúls; throw bread to them right and left,
and after passing them, look up, and you will find a tree in a fountain surrounded
<span class="pageno" id="Page_375">375</span>with roses and jasmine. You will see a pomegranate upon it. Gather it, and
it will thunder, but fear nothing, and go on your way directly, and do not look
behind you after passing the gate.” The queen waits another fortnight, and
then demands the flying castle from Mount Kaf, intending that her father, who
dwelt there, should burn him. The Ghúleh directed Mohammed to dye himself
black, and to provide himself with some mastic (ladin) and lupines. With these,
he makes friends with a black slave, who takes him into the castle, and shows
him a bottle containing the life of the queen; another containing the eyes of
the forty women; a magic sword which spares nothing, and the ring which
moves the castle. Mohammed then sees a beetle,<a id="r442"></a><a href="#f442" class="c011"><sup>[442]</sup></a> which the slave begs him
not to kill, as it is his life. He watches it till it enters a hole, and as soon
as the slave is asleep, he kills it, and the slave dies. Then he lays hands on
the talismans, rushes into the room where the inhabitants of the castle are
condoling with the king and queen on the loss of their three children, and draws
the sword, saying “Strike right and left, and spare neither great nor small.”
Having slain all in the castle, Mohammed removes it to his father’s palace,
when his father orders the cannons to be fired. Then Mohammed tells his
father his history, compels the queen to restore the eyes of the forty women,
when they become prettier than before, and then gives her the flask containing
her life. But she drops it in her fright, and her life ends, and the king places
Mohammed on the throne.</p>

<h4 class="c032">III. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Dame des Arabes Jasmin.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">A king sends his wazir to obtain a talisman of good luck, which is
written for him by Jasmine, the daughter of an Arab Sheikh. The king marries
her, although she demands to be weighed against gold, but drives her away for
kissing a fisherman in return for a bottle which he has drawn out of the river
for her. She goes two days’ journey to a town, where she takes up her abode
with a merchant, and then discovers that whenever she turns the stopper of the
bottle, food, drink, and finally ten white dancing girls emerge from it. The girls
dance, each throws her ten purses of money, and then they retire into the bottle.
She builds herself a grand palace, where her husband seeks her, and seeing the
new palace, orders that no lights shall be lit in the town that night. She lights
up her palace, which convinces the king that he has a dangerous rival. Then
the wazir and the king visit her; the king asks for the bottle, and she demands

<h4 class="c032">IV. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du Pécheur et de son Fils.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">A king falls in love with the wife of a fisherman, and the wazir advises the
former to require the fisherman on pain of death to furnish a large hall with a
carpet in a single piece. The fisherman’s wife sends him to the well of Shoubrah
where he exclaims, “O such-and-such-a-one, thy sister so-and-so salutes thee,
and asks thee to send her the spindle which she forgot when she was with thee
yesterday, for we want to furnish a room with it.” The fisherman drives a nail
<span class="pageno" id="Page_376">376</span>into the floor at one end of the room, fixes the thread on the spindle to it, and
draws out a wonderful carpet. Then the wazir demands a little boy eight days
old, who shall tell a story of which the beginning shall be a lie and the end a lie.
The fisherman is sent to the well with the message, “O such-and-such-a-one,
thy sister so-and-so greets thee, and requests thee to give her the child which
she brought into the world yesterday.” But the child only cries until three
gnats are applied to him, one on each side, and one on the back. Then the boy
speaks, saying, “Peace be on thee, O king!” and afterwards tells his lying
story: “When I was in the flower of my youth, I walked out of the town one
day into the fields when it was very hot. I met a melon-seller, I bought
a melon for a mahboub, took it, cut out a piece, and looked inside, when I saw
a town with a grand hall, when I raised my feet and stepped into the melon.
Then I walked about to look at the people of the town inside the melon. I
walked on till I came out of the town into the country. There I saw a date
tree bearing dates a yard long. I wished for some, and climbed the date-tree to
gather a date and eat it. There I found peasants sowing and reaping on the
date-tree, and the threshing wheels were turning to thresh the wheat. I walked
on a little, and met a man who was beating eggs to make a poultry yard. I
looked on, and saw the chickens hatch; the cocks went to one side and the hens
to the other. I stayed near them till they grew up, when I married them to each
other, and went on. Presently I met a donkey carrying sesame-cakes, so I cut
off a piece and ate it. When I had eaten it, I looked up, and found myself
outside the melon, and the melon became whole as it was at first.” Then the
child rebukes and threatens the king and the wazir, and the fisherman’s wife
sends her husband to take the child back to the well.</p>

<p class="c000">The fisherman had a son named Mohammed l’Avisé (Al-Shátír), who was as
handsome as his mother; but the king had a son whose complexion was like that
of a Fellah. The boys went to school together, and the prince used to say,
“Good day, fisherman’s son,” and Mohammed used to reply, “Good day, O son of
the king, looking like a shoe-string.” The prince complained to his father, who
ordered the schoolmaster to kill Mohammed, and he bastinadoed him severely.
The boy went to his father, and turned fisherman. On the first day he caught a
mullet (Fr. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rouget</span></i>), and was about to fry it, when it cried out that it was one of
the princesses of the river, and he threw it back. Then the wazir advised the king
to send Mohammed to fetch the daughter of the king of the Green Country,
seven years journey distant. By the advice of the fish, Mohammed asked the
king for a golden galley; and on reaching the Green Country, invited the
inhabitants to inspect his galley. At last the princess came down, and he carried
her off. When she found she was entrapped, she threw her ring into the sea,
which the fish caught. When the king proposed to the princess, she first
demanded her ring, which Mohammed immediately presented to the king.
Then she said it was the custom of her country on the occasion of a marriage to
dig a trench from the palace to the river, which was filled with wood, and set on
fire. The bridegroom was required to walk through the trench to the river.
The wazir proposed that Mohammed should walk through the trench first; and
by the fish’s advice, he stopped his ears, cried out, “In the name of God, the
Compassioning, the Merciful,” threw himself into the trench, and returned from
the river handsomer than before. So the wazir said to the king, “Send for
your son to go with us, that he may become as handsome as Mohammed.” So
<span class="pageno" id="Page_377">377</span>the three threw themselves into the fire, and were burned to ashes, and
Mohammed married the princess.</p>

<h4 class="c032">V. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de Dalâl.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">Dalal was a little girl, the daughter of a king, who found a louse on her
head, and put it into a jar of oil, where it remained till Dalal was twenty years
old, when it burst the jar, and emerged in the form of a horned buffalo. The
king ordered the hide to be hung at the gate of the palace, and proclaimed that
anyone who could discover what the skin was should marry his daughter, but
whoever tried and failed should lose his head. Thirty-nine suitors thus perished,
when a Ghúl passed by in the form of a man, who knew the secret. He took Dalal
home with him and brought her a man’s head, but as she would not eat it, he
brought her a sheep. He then visited her under the forms of her mother and her
two aunts, and told her that her husband was a Ghúl; but she refused to believe it
until the third visit. Then he was angry; but she begged him to let her go to
the bath before she was eaten. He consented, took her to a bath, and sat at
the door; but she rubbed herself with mud, changed clothes with an old lupine-seller,
and escaped for a time. She reached a palace which she would not
enter until she was invited by the Prince himself, who then proposed to marry
her, but on the wedding day, her husband, having tracked her out, contrived
that another Ghúl in the form of a man should present him to the king in the
form of a sheep, pretending that he had been reared in a harem, and would
bleat so loud that nobody could sleep, unless he was tethered in the women’s
apartments. At night the Ghúl carried off Dalal from beside the prince to the
adjoining room, but she begged to be allowed to retire for a few moments, when
she called upon Saint Zaynab for help, who sent one of her sisters (?) a Jinniyah.
She clove the wall, and asked Dalal to promise to give her her first child. She
then gave her a piece of wood to throw into the mouth of the Ghúl when he
opened his mouth to eat her.<a id="r443"></a><a href="#f443" class="c011"><sup>[443]</sup></a> He fell on the ground senseless, and Dalal
woke up the prince who slew him. But when Dalal brought forth a daughter
whom she gave to the Jinniyah, her mother-in-law declared that Dalal herself
was a Ghulah, and she was banished to the kitchen, where she pealed onions for
ten years. At the end of this time the Jinniyah again clove the wall, and
brought back the young princess, who was introduced to her father, who took
Dalal again into favour. Meantime the sultan of the Jinn sent for the Jinniyah,
for his son was ill, and could only be cured by a cup of water from the Sea of
Emeralds; and this could only be obtained by a daughter of mankind. So
the Jinniyah borrowed Dalal’s daughter again, and took her to the sultan, who
gave her a cup, and mounted her on a Jinni, warning her not to wet her fingers.
But a wave touched the hand of the princess, which turned as green as clover.
Every morning the Sea of Emerald is weighed by an officer to discover
whether any has been stolen; and as soon as he discovered the deficiency, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_378">378</span>took a platter of glass rings and bracelets, and went from palace to palace
calling out, “Glass bracelets and rings, O young ladies.” When he came to
Dalal’s palace, the young princess was looking out of the window, and insisted
on going herself to try them on. She hesitated to show her right hand; and
the spy knew that she was guilty, so he seized her hand, and sunk into the
ground with her. He delivered her over to the servants of the Sea of Emerald,
who would have beaten her, but the Jinn surrounded her, and prevented them.
Then the King of the Sea of Emerald ordered her to be taken, bound into
the bath, saying that he would follow in the form of a serpent, and devour
her. But she recognised him by his green eyes, when he became a man,
ordered her to be restored to her father, and afterwards married her. He
gave forty camel loads of emeralds and jacinths as her dowry, and always
visited her by night in the form of a winged serpent, entering and leaving by
the window.</p>

<h4 class="c032">VI. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la fille vertueuse.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">A merchant and his wife set out to the Hejaz with their son, leaving their
daughter to keep house, and commending her to the protection of the Kazi.
The Kazi fell in love with the girl, but as she would not admit him, he employed
an old woman to entice her to the bath; but the girl threw soap in his eyes,
pushed him down and broke his head, and escaped to her own house, carrying off
his clothes. When the Kazi was well enough to get about again he found that she
had had the door of her house walled up until the return of her friends, so he
wrote a slanderous letter to her father, who sent her brother to kill her, and
bring him a bottle of her blood. But her brother, although he thought the
walling up of the door was a mere pretence, could not find it in his heart to kill
her, but abandoned her in the desert, and filled the bottle with gazelle-blood.
When the young girl awoke, she wandered to a spring, and climbed into a tree
where a prince who was passing saw her, carried her home, and married her.
She had two sons and a daughter, but one of their playmates refused to play
with them because they had no maternal uncle. The king then ordered the
wazir to escort the princess and her three children to her father’s village for a
month; but on the road, the wazir made love to her, and she allowed him to
kill her three children in succession to save her honour. At last, he became so
pressing that she pretended to consent, but asked to quit the tent for a moment,
with a cord attached to her hand to prevent her escape. But she untied the
cord, fastened it to a tree, and fled. As they could not find the princess, the
wazir advised the soldiers to tell the king that a Ghúleh had devoured the
children, and fled into the desert. The princess changed clothes with a shepherd
boy, went to a town, and took a situation in a café. When the wazir returned
to the king, and delivered his report, the king proposed that they should disguise
themselves, and set out in search of the princess and her children; and the
wazir could not refuse. Meantime, the brother of the princess had admitted to
her father that he had not slain her, and they also set out in search of her,
taking the Kazi with them. They all met at the café, where she recognised
them, and offered to tell them a story. She related her own, and was restored
to her friends. They seized the Kazi and the wazir, and sent for the old woman,
when they burned them all three, and scattered their ashes in the air.</p>

  <h4 class="c032">VII. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du prince qui apprit un métier.</span></i></h4>
</div>

<p class="c027">A prince named Mohammed l’Avisé went to seek a wife, and fell in love with
the daughter of a leek-grower. She would not accept him unless he learned a
trade, so he learned the trade of a silk weaver, who taught him in five minutes;
and he worked a handkerchief with the palace of his father embroidered upon
it. Two years afterwards, the prince and the wazir took a walk, when they
found a Maghrabi seated at the gate of the town, who invited them to take coffee.
But he was a prisoner (or rather, a murderer) who imprisoned them behind
seven doors; and after three days he cooked the wazir, and was going to cook
the prince, but he persuaded him to take his handkerchief to market, where it
was recognised, and the prince released from his peril. Two years later
the king died, and the prince succeeded to the throne. The latter had a son
and daughter, but he died when the boy was six and the girl eight, warning the
boy not to marry until the girl was married, lest his wife should ill-use her.
After two years, the sister said, “Brother, if I show you the treasures of your
father and mother, what will you do?” He answered, “I will buy a slipper for
you and a slipper for me, and we will play with them among the stones.” “No,”
said she, “you are still too little,” and waited a year before she asked him again.
This time he answered, “I will buy a tambourine for you, and a flute for
myself, and we will play in the street.” She waited two years more, and this
time he answered, “We will use them to repair the water-wheels and my father’s
palaces, and we will sow and reap.” “Now you are big,” said she, and gave
him the treasures, which he used to erect buildings in his father’s country. Soon
afterwards, an old woman persuaded the youth to marry her daughter; but
she herself went into the mountains, collected eggs of the bird Oumbar, which
make virgins pregnant if they eat them, and gave them to the sister. The old
woman reported the result to the king, who visited his sister to satisfy himself
of the truth of the matter, and then left her, but sent her food by a slave. When
the sister’s time came, four angels descended from heaven, and took her
daughter, bringing the child to her mother to be nursed. The mother died of
grief, and the angels washed and shrouded her and wept over her; and when
the king heard it, he opened the door, and the angels flew away to heaven
with the child. The king ordered a tomb to be built in the palace for his sister,
and was so much grieved at her death that he went on pilgrimage. When he
had been gone some time, and the time of his return approached, the old woman
opened the sister’s tomb, intending to throw her body to the dogs to devour,
and to put the carcase of a sheep in its place. The angels put the child in the
tomb, and she reproached and threatened the old woman; who, however,
seized upon her and dyed her black, pretending that she was a little black slave
whom she had bought. When the king returned, he pitied her, and called her
to sit by him, but she asked for a candle and candlestick to hold in her hand
before all the company. Then she told her mother’s story, saying to the candle
at every word, “Gutter for kings; this is my uncle, the chief of kings.” Then
the candle threw mahboubs on her uncle’s knees. When the story was ended
the king ordered proclamation to be made, “Let whosoever loves the Prophet
and the Elect, bring wood and fire.” The people obeyed, and the old woman
and her daughter were burned.</p>

</div>

<p class="c027">A woman prayed to God to give her a daughter, even if she should die of
the smell of flax. When the girl was ten years old, the king’s son passed
through the street, saw her at the window, and fell in love with her. An old
woman discovered that he loved Sittoukan, the daughter of a merchant, and
promised to obtain her. She contrived to set her to spin flax, when a splinter
ran under her nail, and she fainted. The old woman persuaded her father and
mother to build a palace in the midst of the river, and to lay her there on a bed.
Thither she took the prince, who turned the body about, saw the splinter, drew
it out, and the girl awoke. He remained with her forty days, when he went
down to the door, where he found the wazir waiting, and they entered the
garden. There they found roses and jasmines, and the prince said, “The jasmines
are as white as Sittoukan, and the roses are like her cheeks; if you did
not approve, I would still remain with her, were it only for three days.” He went
up again for three days, and when he next visited the wazir, they saw a carob-tree,
and the prince said, “Remember wazir, the carob-tree is like the eyebrows
of Sittoukan, and if you would not let me, I would still remain with her, were
it only for three days.” Three days later, they saw a fountain, when the prince
observed that it was like the form of Sittoukan, and he returned. But this
time, she was curious to know why he always went and returned, and he found
her watching behind the door, so he spat on her saying, “If you did not love
men, you would not hide behind doors”; and he left her. She wandered into
the garden in her grief, where she found the ring of empire, which she rubbed,
and the ring said, “At your orders, what do you ask for?” She asked for increased
beauty, and a palace beside that of the prince. The prince fell in love
with her, and sent his mother to propose for her hand. The mother took two
pieces of royal brocade as a present, which the young lady ordered a slave in
her hearing to cut up for dusters. Then the mother brought her an emerald collar
worth four thousand dinars, when she ordered to be threshed, and thrown to the
pigeons. The old lady acknowledged herself beaten, and asked Sittoukan if
she wished to marry or not. The latter demanded that the prince should be
wrapped in seven shrouds, and carried to the palace which she indicated, as
if he were dead. Then she went and took off the shrouds one after another, and
when she came to the seventh, she spat on him, saying, “If you did not love
women, you would not be wrapped in seven shrouds.” Then he said, “Is it
you?” and he bit his finger till he bit it off, and they remained together.</p>

<h4 class="c032">IX. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du musicien ambulant et de son fils.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">This travelling musician was so poor that when his wife was confined, he
went out to beg for their immediate necessities, and found a hen lying on the
ground with an egg under her. He met a Jew to whom he sold the egg for
twenty mabboubs. The hen laid an egg every day, which the Jew bought for
twenty mabboubs, and the musician became rich and opened a merchant’s
shop. When his son was grown, he built a school for him at his own expense,
where poor children were taught to read. Then the musician set out on pilgrimage,
charging his wife not to let the Jew trick her out of the hen. A fortnight
afterwards, the Jew called, and persuaded the woman to sell him the hen for a
casket of silver. He ordered her to cook it, but told her that if anybody else ate
a piece, he would rip him up. The musician’s son came in, while the fowl was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_381">381</span>cooking, and as his mother would not give him any, he seized the gizzard, and
ate it, when one of the slaves warned him to fly before the arrival of the Jew.
The Jew pursued the boy, and would have killed him, but the latter took him
up with one hand, and dashed him to pieces on the ground. The musician’s
son continued his journey, and arrived at a town where thirty-nine heads of
suitors who had failed to conquer the princess in wrestling, were suspended at
the gate of the palace. On the first day the youth wrestled with the princess
for two hours without either being able to overcome the other; but during the
night the king ordered the doctors to drug the successful suitor, and to steal
the talisman. Next morning when the youth awoke, he perceived his weakness,
and fled. Presently he met three men quarrelling over a flying carpet, a food-producing
cup, and a money mill. He threw a stone for them to run after,
and transported himself to Mount Kaf, where he made trial of the other talismans.
Then he returned to the palace, called to the princess to come down to
wrestle with him, and as soon as she stepped on the carpet, carried her away
to Mount Kaf, when she promised to restore the gizzard, and to marry him.
She deserted him, and he found two date-trees, one bearing red and the other
yellow dates. On eating a yellow date, a horn grew from his head<a id="r444"></a><a href="#f444" class="c011"><sup>[444]</sup></a> and twisted
round the two date-trees. A red date removed it. He filled his pockets, and
travelled night and day for two months.<a id="r445"></a><a href="#f445" class="c011"><sup>[445]</sup></a> He cried dates out of season, and the
princess bought sixteen yellow ones, and ate them all; and eight [sixteen?]
horns grew from her head, four to each wall. They could not be sawn off, and
the king offered his daughter to whoever could remove them. When the
musician’s son married the princess, and became wazir, he said to his bride,
“Where is my carpet, &amp;c.” She replied, “Is it you?” “Yes,” said he, “Is
my trick or yours the best?” She admitted that she was beaten, and they
lived together in harmony.</p>

<p class="c027">(This story is briefly given by Mr. W. A. Clouston, Suppl. Nights iii., p. 123;
but I give here a fuller abstract.)</p>

<p class="c000">Three brothers built a palace for their mother and sister after their father’s
death. The sister loved someone of whom the brothers disapproved. An old
woman advised the sister to send her brothers for the singing nightingale. The
two eldest would not wait till the bird was asleep, but while they were trying to shut
his cage, he dusted sand over them with his claws, and sunk them to the seventh
earth. The beads and the ring gave warning of their deaths at home; but the
third, who left a rose with his mother, to fade if he died, captured the bird,
and received sand from under the cage. When he scattered it on the ground,
more than a thousand men rose up, some negroes and some Turks. The brothers
were not among them, so the youngest was told to scatter white sand, when
500 more people emerged, including the brothers. Afterwards the eldest
brother was sitting in his ship when a Maghrebi told him to clean his turban;
which his mother interpreted to mean that his sister had misconducted herself,
and he should kill her. He refused, and fled with her to the desert. Hearing
<span class="pageno" id="Page_382">382</span>voices, he entered a cave where thirty-nine robbers were dividing rations; and
he contrived to appropriate a share, and then to return it when missed; but
as he was detected, he gave himself out as a fellow-robber, engaged himself to
them, and watching his opportunity, slew them. Afterwards he brought his sister
two young lions. She found a wounded negro in the cave, whom she nursed,
and after having had two children by him, plotted against her brother. She
pretended to be ill, and sent him to find the grapes of Paradise. He met a
Ghúleh who gave him a ball which directed him to Paradise, and he returned
safely. Then his sister sent him for the Water of Life, when the two young
lions followed him, and he could not drive them back. After travelling for a year
the brother reached the Sea of the Water of Life, and while resting under a tree,
heard two pigeons telling each other that the king’s daughter was ill, and every
doctor who failed to restore her was put to death, and she could only be cured
by the Water of Life. “Mohammed l’Avisé” filled two bottles and a jar with
the water, cured the princess with the water in the jar, married her, and after
forty days, gave her one bottle, and set out to visit his family. At the sister’s
instigation, the negro slew Mohammed, cut him to pieces, and put the remains
into a sack, which they loaded on the ass. Then the lions drove the ass to the
wife of Mohammed, who restored his life with the water which he had left
with her. Mohammed then shut up the lions, dressed himself as a negro, and
went to visit his sister, taking with him some rings and mastic (ladin). His
sister recognised his eyes; and while she and the negro were disputing,
Mohammed slew the negro and the three [<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>] children, and buried his sister
alive. He then returned to his wife, announced that his relations were dead, and
asked for a hundred camels; and it took them a week to convey away the
treasures of the robbers.</p>

<h4 class="c032">XII. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire du prince et de son cheval.</span></i></h4>

<p class="c027">A prince and foal were born at the same time, and some time afterwards the
mother and the mare died. The king married again, and the new queen had
an intrigue with a Jew. They plotted to poison the prince, but his horse wept
and warned him. Then the queen pretended to be ill, and asked for the heart
of the horse, but the prince fled to another kingdom, and bought clothes from a
poor man, packing his own on his horse. Then he parted from the horse, who
gave him a hair and a flint, telling him to light the hair whenever he needed
him. The prince then went to a town, and engaged himself as under-gardener
to the king. He was set to drive the ox which turned the water-wheel, but one
day he called his horse, put on his own clothes, and galloped about the garden,
where the youngest princess saw “Mohammed l’Avisé” from the window, and
fell in love with him. He then returned to the water-wheel, and when the
head-gardener returned and found the garden in disorder, he wanted to beat
him; but the princess interfered and ordered the prince to receive a fowl and a
cake of bread every day. The princess then persuaded her mother and sisters that
it was time to be married, so the king ordered everybody to pass under the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_383">383</span>window of the seven princesses, each of whom threw down a handkerchief on
the man of her choice. But the youngest would look at no one till at last they
fetched the gardener’s boy, when the king was angry, and confined them in a
room. The king fell ill with vexation, and the doctors ordered him to drink
bear’s milk in the hide of a virgin<a id="r446"></a><a href="#f446" class="c011"><sup>[446]</sup></a> bear. The king’s six sons-in-law were
ordered to seek it, and Mohammed too set forth mounted on a lame mare,
while the people jeered him. Presently he summoned his own horse, and
ordered him to pitch a camp of which the beginning and the end could
not be seen, and which should contain nothing but bears. When the six
sons-in-law passed, they dismounted, and asked the attendants for what they
required, but they referred them to their king. The latter offered them
what they asked, but branded a ring and a circle on the back of each of the
sons-in-law. However, he gave them only the milk and hide of old she-bears,
while he himself took the milk of a virgin<a href="#f446" class="c011"><sup>[446]</sup></a> bear that had just cubbed for
the first time, slaughtered it, put the milk into the skin, and then remounted
his lame mare, saying to the horse, “God reward you.” He returned to town,
and gave the milk to his wife who took it to her mother. Then the six sons-in-law
brought the milk to the doctors, but when they looked at it, they said,
“This is the milk of an old she-bear and is good for nothing.” Then they
gave the king the other milk, and cured him, but he was much annoyed to hear
who had brought it. Soon afterwards a war broke out, and the king
pitched his camp outside the town in face of the enemy. Mohammed set out
again on his lame mare, the people shouting after him, “Go back, sir, for the
soldiers have been defeated.” Then he summoned his horse, put on his
own clothes, and said to the horse, “Let your hair shoot forth fire.” Then he
came before the king, saying, “I declare for you and your six sons-in-law.”
He rushed into battle, smiting with his sword, while his horse shot forth fire.
They slew a third of the enemy, and then disappeared, while the king lamented,
“Ah, if my six sons-in-law had only done this!” After his exertions Mohammed
was tired, and went home to sleep. Next day the same thing happened, but
the king put his own ring on his finger. On the third day he slew the remaining
third of his enemies, but his arm was wounded, and the king bound it up
with his own handkerchief before he departed. The king gathered together
the horses and the spoil, and returned to town, much vexed that his sons-in-law
had done nothing. Then the youngest princess asked her mother to
send for her father to look at the ring and the handkerchief, when he fell
down and kissed the feet of Mohammed, who rose up giddy from sleep,
but when he was asked his history, he answered, “I am a prince like
yourself, and your six sons-in-law are mamelouks of my father. I beat them,
and they took to flight, and through fear of my father, I set out in search
of them. I came here and found that they were your sons-in-law, but I
imposed silence on them. But as regards your daughter, she saw me in
the garden, and recognised my real rank; here is your daughter, O king;
she is still a virgin.” Then the wedding was celebrated with great pomp,
and Mohammed remained with his father-in-law for some time, until he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_384">384</span>desired to return to his own country. On his arrival he found that his
father had died, so he ascended the throne, and ordered his mother-in-law and

    <div>ITS REVIEWERS REVIEWED.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<h3 class="c015">PRELIMINARY.</h3>

<p class="c027">I here propose to produce what may be called the “biography” of a
book whereof, methinks, the writer has some reason to be proud, a work
which, after occupying him for the third of a century, well nigh half the
life of average man and the normal endurance of a generation, can show
for result these sixteen volumes. A labour of such parts and magnitude
deserves, in my humble opinion, some notice of the main features distinguishing
its career, especially of its presentation to Court (Public
Opinion) and its reception by the high officials of the Palace, the critics,
reviewers and criticasters.</p>

<p class="c000">And there is yet another consideration. To ignore the charges and
criminations brought forward by certain literary Sir Oracles would be wilfully
suffering judgment to go by default. However unpopular and despised
may be, as a rule, the criticism of critique and however veridical the
famous apothegm, “A controversy <em>in</em> the Press <em>with</em> the Press is the
controversy of a fly with a spider,” I hold it the author’s bounden duty,
in presence of the Great Public, to put forth his reply, if he have any
satisfactory and interesting rejoinder, and by such ordeal to purge himself
and prove his innocence unless he would incur wittingly impeachment for
contumacy and contempt of court.</p>

<p class="c000">It is not only an instinct of human nature expressed by <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">nemo me
impunè lacessit</span></i> which impels to answering in presence of the passers-by
the enemy at the gate; it is also a debt which his honour and a
respectful regard for the good opinion of his fellows compel the author
to repay. The man who is feeble enough silently to suffer detraction and
calumny at the hands of some sciolist or <em>Halb-bildung</em> sheltering his
miserable individuality under the shadow (may it never be less!) of
“King We,” simply sins against himself as the Arabs say and offends
good manners by holding out a premium to wanton aggression and
injurious doing. The reading world has a right to hear the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">alteram
<span class="pageno" id="Page_388">388</span>partem</span></i> before it shall deliver that judgment and shall pronounce that
sentence wherefrom lies no appeal. To ignore and not to visit with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">représailles</span></i>
unworthy and calumnious censure, may become that ideal and
transcendental man who forgives (for a personal and egoistical reason)
those who trespass against him. But the sublime doctrine which
commands us to love our enemies and affect those who despitefully entreat
us is in perilous proximity to the ridiculous; at any rate it is a vain and
futile rule of life which the general never thinks of obeying. It contrasts
poorly with the common sense of the pagan—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fiat Justitia, ruat cœlum</span></i>;
and the heathenish and old-Adamical sentiment of the clansman anent
Roderick Dhu—</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">—commends itself far more to what divines are pleased to call “fallen
human nature” that is the natural man.</p>

<p class="c000">And here before crossing the threshold, I would seize the opportunity
of expressing my cordial gratitude and hearty thanks to the Press in
general, which has received my Eastern studies and contributions to
Oriental knowledge in the friendliest and most sympathetic spirit, appreciating
my labours far beyond the modicum of the offerer’s expectation
and lending potent and generous aid to place them before the English world
in the fairest and most favourable point of view. To number a small proportion
of “black sheep” is no shame for a flock amounting to myriads:
such exceptional varieties must be bred for the use and delectation of
those who prefer to right wrong and darkness to light. It is with these
only that my remarks and retorts will deal and consequently I have
assigned to them the post of honour. The various extracts from notices
favourable, appreciative and complimentary, appear as the “Opinions of
the Press” at the end of this volume, and again I take the opportunity of
professing myself truly thankful for the good word of the Fourth Estate,
and for its wisely detecting the soul of good in things evil.</p>

<p class="c000">The romantic and exceptional circumstances under which my large
labour was projected and determined have been sufficiently described in
the Foreword (vol. i. pp. vi-ix). I may here add that during a longsome
obligatory halt of some two months at East African Zayla’ and throughout
a difficult and dangerous march across the murderous Somali country upon
Harar-Gay, then the Tinbukhtú of Eastern Africa, <cite>The Nights</cite> rendered
me the best of service. The wildlings listened with the rapt attention of
little lads and lasses to the marvellous recitals of the charming Queen and
the monotonous interpellations of her lay-image sister and looked forward
to the evening lecture as the crown and guerdon of the toilsome day.
And assuredly never was there a more suitable setting, a more admirable
<span class="pageno" id="Page_389">389</span><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène</span></i> for The Nights than the landscape of Somali-land, a prospect so
adapted to their subject-matter that it lent credibility even to details the least
credible. Barren and grisly for the most part, without any of the charms
gladdening and beautifying the normal prospects of earth, grassy hill and
wooded dale, park-like plain and placid lake, and the snaking of silvery
stream, it displays ever and anon beauties made all its own by borrowing
from the heavens, in an atmosphere of passing transparency, reflections
of magical splendours and of weird shadows proper to tropical skies. No
rose-hue pinker than the virginal blush and dewy flush of dawn in contrast
with the shivering reek of flaming noon-tide, when all brightness of colour
seems burnt out of the world by the white heat of sun-glow. No brilliancy
more gorgeous or more ravishing than the play of light and shade, the
rainbow shiftings and the fiery pinks and purples and ambers and carmines
of the sunset scenery—the gorgeous death-bed of the Day. No tint more
tender, more restful, than the uniform grey, pale and pearly, invading by
slowest progress that ocean of crimson that girds the orb of the Sun-King,
diminishing it to a lakelet of fire and finally quenching it in iridescent
haze. No gloom more ghostly than the murky hangings drooping like
curtains from the violet heavens during those traveller’s trials the unmooned
nights, when the world seems peopled by weird phantoms and
phantasms of man and monster, moving and at rest. No verdure more
exquisite than earth’s glazing of greenery, the blend of etherial azure and
yellow; no gold more sheeny than the foregrounds of sand shimmering
in the slant of the sun; no blue more profound and transparent than
the middle distances; no neutral tints more subtle, pure, delicate and
sight-soothing than the French gray which robes the clear-cut horizon;
no variety of landscape more pronounced than the alternations of glowing
sunlight and snowy moonlight and twinkling starlight, all streaming
through diaphanous air. No contrast more admirable than the alternation
of iron upland whereupon hardly a blade of grass may grow and the Wady
with its double avenue of leek-green tamarisks, hedging now a furious
rain-torrent then a ribbon of purest sand; or the purple-grey shadow rising
majestic in the Orient to face the mysterious Zodiacal Light, a white
pyramid whose base is Amenti—region of resting Osiris—and whose apex
pierces the zenith. And not rarely this “after-glow” is followed by a blush
of “celestial rosy-red” mantling the whole circle of the horizon where the
hue is deepest and paling into the upper azure where the stars shine their
brightest. How often in Somali-land I repeated to myself</p>

<p class="c000">and the picture still haunts me.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c013">And now, turning away from these and similar pleasures of memory, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_390">390</span>passing over the once-told tale (Foreword, vol. i. pp. ix., x.) of how, when
and where work was begun, together with the disappointment caused by
the death of my friend and collaborator, Steinhaeuser; concerning the
copying process which commenced in 1879 and anent the precedence
willingly accorded to the “Villon Edition,” I proceed directly to what
may be termed</p>

<h3 class="c015">THE ENGINEERING OF THE WORK.</h3>

<p class="c027">During the autumn of ’82, after my return from the Gold Coast (with
less than no share of the noble metal which my companion Cameron and
I went forth to find and found a failure), my task began in all possible
earnest with ordering the old scraps of translation and collating a vast
heterogeneous collection of notes. I was fortunate enough to discover, at
unlettered Trieste, an excellent copyist able and willing to decypher a
crabbed hand and deft at reproducing facetious and drolatic words without
thoroughly comprehending their significance. At first my exertions were
but fitful and the scene was mostly a sick bed to which I was bound
between October ’83 and June ’84. Marienbad, however, and Styrian Sauerbrunn
(bei Rohitsch) set me right and on return to Trieste (Sept. 4, ’84),
we applied ourselves to the task of advertising, the first two volumes
being almost ready for print. And here we were confronted by a serious
question, What number of copies would suffice my public? A distinguished
Professor who had published some 160,000 texts with prices
ranging from 6d. to 50 guineas, wrote to me in all kindness advising an
issue of 150 to 250: an eminent printer-publisher would have ventured
upon some 500: others rose to 750 with a warning-note anent “wreckage,”
great risk and ruinous expenditure, while only one friend—and he not in
business—urged an edition of 2,000 to 3,000 with encouraging words as
to its probable reception. After long forethought I choose 1,000 as a
just middle.</p>

<p class="c000">We then drew up a long list, names of friends, acquaintances and
strangers likely to patronise the novelty and caused the following three
papers to be lithographed and printed at Trieste.</p>

<h4 class="c030">No. I.</h4>

<p class="c016"><em>Captain Burton, having neither agent nor publisher for his forthcoming</em> <span class="sc">Arabian
Nights</span>, <em>requests that all subscribers will kindly send their names and addresses to him
personally (Captain Burton, Trieste, Austria), when they will be entered into a book kept
for the purpose</em>.</p>

<p class="c012"><em>There will be 10 volumes at a guinea a piece, each to be paid for on delivery. Subscribers
may count on the first three volumes being printed in March next. Captain
<span class="pageno" id="Page_391">391</span>Burton pledges himself to furnish copies to all subscribers who address themselves to him;
and he also undertakes not to issue, nor to allow the issue of a cheaper Edition. One
thousand copies will be printed; the whole Manuscript will be ready before going to press
in February, and the ten volumes will be issued within Eighteen Months.</em></p>

<p class="c000">This was presently followed by</p>

<h4 class="c030">No. II.</h4>

<p class="c016"><em>The Student of Arabic who reads</em> “<cite class="scite">The Nights</cite>” <em>with this version, will not
only be competent to join in any conversation, to peruse the popular books and newspapers,
and to write letters to his friends, he will also find in the notes a repertoire of those
Arabian Manners and Customs, Beliefs and Practices, which are not discussed in popular
works</em>.</p>

<p class="c012"><em>The 10 volumes will be handsomely bound in black and gold.</em></p>

<p class="c012"><em>No subscriptions will be received until the work is done, and then at Coutts’ Bank,
Strand, London.</em></p>

<p class="c012"><em>Subscribers who apply directly are preferred.</em></p>

<p class="c012"><em>The author will pay carriage of volumes all over the United Kingdom. A London
address is requested.</em></p>

<p class="c000">And, lastly, after some delay, came the subjoined cutting from the
<cite>Daily Tribune</cite>, New York.</p>

<h4 class="c030">No. III.</h4>

<p class="c016">“It has already been announced that the first instalment of Captain Burton’s new
translation of the Arabian Nights may be expected this autumn. I am indebted to a
friend of his for some details which have not yet, I think, been made public. There is
still room for a translation of the Arabian Nights. All or nearly all the popular editions,
of which there are hundreds, are but renderings, more or less imperfect, from Professor
Galland’s French version, which is itself an abridgment from the original, and turns a
most valuable ethnographical work into a mere collection of fairy tales. Moreover,
these English translations abound in Gallicisms, and their style offers but a painful
contrast to the French of the seventeenth century. Some years since a Mr. Torrens
undertook a complete translation from the original, but his work did not go beyond a
single volume, or fifty tales out of the 1,001. Then came Mr. Lane in 1839, whose
success was but moderate. In his three large and (in the 1839 edition) beautifully
illustrated volumes, he has given not more than half the tales. He used the Cairo
Arabic edition, which is itself an abridgment, and took all kinds of liberties with the
text, translating verse into prose, and excising everything that was not ‘strictly
proper.’</p>

<p class="c012">“Lastly, there is Mr. John Payne’s excellent translation, which has occupied him
during seven years and is just brought to a conclusion. Mr. Payne bound himself to
print not more than 500 copies, and his nine volumes, not published but printed,
nominally for the Villon Society, are unprocurable except at a price which to the general
public is prohibitive.</p>

<p class="c012"><span class="pageno" id="Page_392">392</span>“Captain Burton began his work on this extraordinary monument of Oriental
literature in 1852, at Aden, with some help from his friend Dr. Steinhaeuser, of the
Bombay Army. He has gone on with it as opportunity offered, and as other literary
and official labours and his many journeys in savage lands permitted. The text and the
subject offer many difficulties, and it is to these difficulties that he has devoted especial
attention. His object is to reproduce the book in a form as entirely Arabian as possible,
preserving the strict division of the nights, and keeping (a more questionable matter) to
the long unbroken sentences in which the composer indulged, imitating also the rhythmic
prose which is a characteristic of the Arabic. The effect in English remains to be seen,
but of the value of Captain Burton’s method as an experiment in literature there can be
no doubt, or of its great interest to everybody who cares for Oriental habits of thought
and language. He will not shirk any of the passages which do not suit the taste of the
day; but these Captain Burton thinks, will not commonly be found more objectionable
than some which are in Shakespeare and in Shakespeare’s contemporaries. At the same
time it will be understood that the book is intended for men only and for the study;—not
for women or children, nor for the drawing-room table or dentist’s waiting-room.
It will be printed by subscription and not published.</p>

<p class="c012">“Few are the Oriental scholars in England who could do justice to this picture of the
mediæval Arab. Captain Burton is perhaps the only one who joins to the necessary
linguistic knowledge that varied practical experience of Eastern life which alone in many
cases can supply the true meaning of a troublesome passage or an accurate comment
upon it. His aim is to make the book in its English dress not only absolutely literal in
text but Oriental in tone and colour. He knows the tales almost by heart, and used to
keep the Bedouin tribes in roars of laughter in camp during the long summer nights by
reciting them. Sheiks to whom a preternatural solemnity of demeanour is usual were to
be seen rolling on the ground in paroxysms of uncontrollable mirth. It was also
Burckhardt’s custom to read the stories aloud, but the Arabs would snatch the book
from his hand because his pronunciation was so bad. Captain Burton is said to have an
Arab accent not easily distinguishable from the native. When he contents himself with
the English tongue here in England, he is one of the most picturesque talkers to be met
with. I can remember a certain dinner-party, now many years ago, where the great
traveller kept us all listening till long past day-break; narrating, as he did, the most
singular adventures with the most vivid fidelity to facts. That, however, is a digression.
I have only to add that Captain Burton has the names of many subscribers and will
doubtless be glad to receive others, which may, I suppose, be sent to him at Trieste.
His present hope is to be ready to go to press next February and to bring out the whole
of the volumes in 1885.”</p>

<p class="c000">Concerning this “American” communication and its author I shall
have more to say in a future page.</p>

<p class="c000">Some 24,000 to 30,000 circulars were posted at an expense of £126
and they produced about 800 favourable replies which, after my return to
England (May ’85), rose to 1,500 and to 2,000, as my unprofessional
friend, and he only, had anticipated. Meanwhile occurred an incident
characteristic of such appeals by the inexperienced to the public. A case
containing 1,100 circulars had been sent to my agent for mailing in
London, and my secretary had unfortunately gummed their envelopes.
Hereupon I should have been subjected by the Post Office to the pains
and penalties of the law, perhaps to a fine of £200. But when the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_393">393</span>affair was reported, with due explanations, to the late lamented Postmaster-General
Henry Fawcett—a man in a million, and an official in ten
millions—he had the justice and generosity to look upon the offence as
the result of pure ignorance, and I received a caution “not to do it
again.”</p>

<p class="c000">Needless to say that I lost no time about advertising my mistake in
the dailies, giving the name of my agent and in offering to refund the
money. Some of the sealed and unpaid envelopes had, however, been
forwarded prematurely and the consequence was a comical display of wrath
in quarters where it was hardly to be expected. By way of stemming the
unpleasant tide of abuse I forwarded the following <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</span></i> to The
Academy.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c002">

<p class="c012">“Can you kindly find space for a few lines on a purely personal matter which is
causing me abundant trouble? A box of circulars giving details concerning my forthcoming
version of the Arabian Nights was sent to London with directions to stamp and
post the contents. The envelopes having been inadvertently gummed down, the case
was stopped by the Custom-house, and was transmitted to the Post Office where it was
found to contain circulars not letters; and of these sundry were forwarded without pre-payment.
The pleasant result was that one outspoken gentleman writes upon the
circular, which he returns,—<em>When you send your trash again, put postage-stamps on.</em> A
second is peremptorily polite, <em>Please forward four stamps to the Adjutant of the —th
Regiment.</em> The ‘Chaplain of the Forces at ——,’ at once ironical and severe, <em>ventures
to suggest to Captain Burton that it is advisable, if he thinks his book worth selling, to
put the postage on future advertisements</em>. A fourth who, I regret to say, signs himself
Lieutenant-Colonel, gives me advice about pre-payment written in an orderly’s hand
upon a torn envelope (gratuitously insulting!); encloses the 2d. stamp and sends the
missive under official cover ‘On Her Majesty’s Service.’ The idea of a French or an
Austrian Colonel lowering himself so infinitely low! Have these men lost all sense of
honour, all respect for themselves (and others) because they can no longer be called to
account for their insolence <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">more majorum</span></i>? I never imagined ‘Tuppence’ to be so
cunning a touchstone for detecting and determining the difference between gold and
dross; nor can I deeply regret that circumstance and no default of mine has placed in
hand Ithuriel’s spear in the shape of the said ‘Tuppence’.”</p>

<p class="c000">The process of filling-up my list presented a fine and varied study of
character; and an extensive experience of subscribers, as well as of nonsubscribers,
presently enabled me to distribute the genus into the following
eight species. The friendly subscriber who takes ten copies (more or less)
forwarding their value. The gentleman subscriber who pays down his
money confidingly. The cautious-canny subscriber who ventures £5. 5s.,
or half the price. The impudent and snobbish subscriber who will

<p class="c000">No. vi. is the fussy and troublesome subscriber who gives more bother
than he is worth, and who takes a vicious pride in not paying till pushed
to the last point. The professional subscriber fights hard for the most
favourable terms, and holds it his vested right to “part” by dribblets. And
lastly comes the dishonest subscriber who does not pay at all. I must,
however, in justice own that species No. viii. is rare: of one thousand the
proportion was only about a score.</p>

<p class="c000">In mid-June, ’85, I returned to London and began at once to prepare
for issuing the book. Having found the publisher peculiarly unsatisfactory—with
one single and remarkable exception my venerable friend,
Mr. Van Voorst, whilome of Paternoster Row—I determined, like Professor
Arber, to do without him, although well aware how risky was the
proceeding, which would, in the case of a work for general reading, have
arrayed against me the majority of the trade and of their “hands,” the
critics. Then I sought hard, but sought in vain, for the agency of a
literary friend or friends, men of name and note, like those who assisted
in the Villon version: all feared the responsibility and the expected storm
of abuse which, however, failed to burst.</p>

<p class="c000">Under these circumstances “The Printing Times,” a professional
periodical produced by Messieurs Wymans, was pleased (August 25, ’85)
to be unpleasantly intrusive on the subject of my plan. “We always
heard associated with the publication of this important work, the name
of Mr. ——, which is now conspicuous by its absence, nor is, apparently
the name of any other leading publishing house to be identified with
its production.” (The Printer’s Devil is, I presume, responsible for the
English!) The writer then warns me in all (un-)friendliness that if the
printers forget to add their imprint, they would become liable to a
legal penalty; that the work is unsafe for literal translation and, lastly,
that although printed by private subscription, “it is likely enough to be
pronounced an injury to public morals to the danger of the author and
his printers.” The unhappy article concludes, “We await the issue of
the first volume since much will depend upon the spirit (!) in which the
translation has been undertaken; certainly the original text is not suitable
<span class="pageno" id="Page_395">395</span>for general circulation (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">connu!</span></i>) unless edited with the utmost care
and discretion.”</p>

<p class="c000">To this production so manifestly inspired by our old friend £ s. d.,
I replied in <cite>The Academy</cite> (August 7, ’85), the gist of the few lines
being as follows:—</p>

<p class="c012">In answer to many inquiries from friends and others, will you allow me to repeat,
through your columns, that my translation of the “Arabian Nights” will be strictly
limited to 1,000 copies, each sent to picked subscribers, and to renew the promise which
I before made, that no cheaper edition shall be printed? Correspondents have complained
that I have not stated the price; but I have mentioned over and over again that
there are ten volumes, at one guinea each—my object in making it so expensive being to
keep it from the general public. I am also troubled with inquiries as to who is my
publisher. I am my own publisher, inaugurating (Inshallah!) a golden age for authors.
Jesting apart, the book has no publisher. It is printed by myself for the benefit of
Orientalists and Anthropologists, and nothing could be more repugnant to me than the
idea of a book of the kind being published or being put into the hands of any publisher.</p>

<p class="c000">The first volume dated “<em>Benares: MDCCCLXXXV: Printed by the
Kamashastra Society for Private Subscribers only</em>,” did not appear till
September 12, ’85: it had been promised for March and had been
delayed by another unavoidable detention at Trieste. But my subscribers
had no further cause of complaint; ten tomes in sixteen months ought
to satisfy even the most exigent.</p>

<p class="c000">No. i. volume was accompanied by a circular earnestly requesting
that the book might not be exposed for sale in public places or permitted
to fall into the hands of any save curious students of Moslem manners.
Yet the birth of the first-born was accompanied (I am fain to confess)
with no small trouble and qualms to the parent and to all who assisted
at the parturition. Would the “little stranger” robed in black and gold,
the colours of the Abbaside Caliphs, with its brick-red night-cap after the
fashion of ecclesiastical bantlings, be kindly welcomed or would it be
regarded as an abortion, a monster? The reader will readily understand
how welcome to an author in such perplexity came the following article
from the <cite>Standard</cite> (September 12), usually attributed to the popular
and trenchant pen of Mr. Alfred Austin. I must be permitted to quote it
entire, because it expresses so fully and so admirably all and everything
I could desire a reviewer to write. And the same paper has never ceased
to give me the kindest encouragement: its latest notice was courteous
and appreciative as its earliest.</p>

<p class="c012">The first volume of Captain Burton’s long-expected edition of the “Arabian
Nights” was issued yesterday to those who are in a position to avail themselves of
the wealth of learning contained in this monumental labour of the famous Eastern
traveller. The book is printed for subscribers only, and is sold at a price which is
not likely to be paid by any save the scholars and students for whose instruction it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_396">396</span>is intended. But though the Benares “Kamashastra Society” are careful to let the
world know that the “Thousand Nights and a Night” is not “published” in the
technical sense of the term, the pages which will be read by a thousand purchases
may be fittingly regarded as the property of the world at large. In any case, the day
when the experience of a life was embodied into this fresh translation of the “Alf
Laylah wa Laylah” marks a distinct stage in the history of Oriental research. The
world has had numerous versions of these stories. For at least a century and a half
they have delighted old and young, until Shahrazade and Dunyazade, the Fisherman
and the Jinn, and the tales told by the Tailor, the Kalendar, the Nazarene
broker, and the Hunchback ... to say nothing of Aladdin, Ali Baba, Sinbad the
Sailor, and Camaralzaman and Badoura—seem like the most familiar of friends.
Yet many of those who know the ordinary epitome prepared for the nursery and the
drawing-room have little idea of the nature of the original. Galland’s abridgment
was a mere shadow of the Arabic. Even the editions of Lane and Habicht and Torrens
and Von Hammer represented but imperfectly the great corpus of Eastern folk-lore
which Captain Burton has undertaken to render into English, without regard to the
susceptibilities of those who, not having bought the book, are, therefore, in no way
concerned in what is the affair of him and his subscribers. The best part of two
centuries have passed away since Antoine Galland first turned some of the tales
into French, and got stigmatised as a forger for his pains. Never was there such a
sensation as when he printed his translations. For weeks he had been pestered by
troops of roysterers rousing him out of bed, and refusing to go until the shivering Professor
recited one of the Arab stories to the crowd under his window. Nor has the
interest in them in any way abated. Thousands of copies pass every year into circulation;
and any one who has ever stood in the circle around the professional story-teller
of the East must have noticed how often he draws on this deathless collection. The
camel-driver listens to them as eagerly as did his predecessors ages ago. The
Badawi laughs in spite of himself, though next moment he ejaculates a startling
“Astaghfaru’llah” for listening to the light mention of the sex whose name is never
heard amongst the Nobility of the Desert. Or if the traveller is a scholar and a
gentleman, he will pull out his book for the amusement of the company squatted round
the camp fire, as did Captain Burton many a time and oft in the course of his Eastern
wanderings.</p>

<p class="c012">To Captain Burton the preparation of these volumes must have been a labour of
love. He began them in conjunction with his friend Steinhaeuser, soon after his return
from the Mecca pilgrimage, more than thirty years ago, and he has been doing something
to them ever since. In the swampy jungles of West Africa a tale or two has been
turned into English, or a poem has been versified during the tedium of official life in
the dank climate of Brazil. From Sind to Trieste the manuscript has formed part and
parcel of his baggage, and though, in the interval, the learned author has added many
a volume to the shelf-full which he has written, the “Thousand Nights and a Night” have
never been forgotten. And now when he nears the end of his labours it seems as if we
had never before known what the beauteous Shahrazad told the King who believed not in
the constancy of women. Captain Burton seems the one sober man among drunkards.
We have all the old company, though they appear in dresses so entirely new that one
scans the lines again and again before the likeness is quite recognised. However,
Tajal-Mulook will no doubt be as knightly as ever when his turn comes, for the Barber
is garrulous, after the old fashion, and the three Shaykhs relate their experiences with
the Jinns, the gazelles, and mules as vividly as they have done any time these thousand
years or more. King Yoonan and the Sage Dooban are here, and so are King Sindibad
and his falcon, the young Prince of the Black Islands, the envious Weezer and the
Ghoolah; and the story of the Porter and the Ladies of Baghdad lose nothing of their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_397">397</span>charms in the new, and, we may add, extremely unsophisticated version. For Captain
Burton’s work is not <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">virginibus puerisque</span></i>, and, while disclaiming for his version anything
like intentional indecorum, he warns the readers that they will be guilty of a
breach of good faith should they permit a work prepared only for students to fall into
the hands of boys and girls. From the first to almost the penultimate edition of these
stories the drawing-room alone has been consulted. Even Mr. Payne, though his
otherwise faithful version was printed for the Villon Society, had the fear of Mrs.
Grundy before his eyes. Moreover, no previous editor—not even Lane himself—had
a tithe of Captain Burton’s acquaintance with the manners and customs of the
Moslem East. Hence, not unfrequently, they made ludicrous blunders, and in no
instance did they supply anything like the explanatory notes which have added so
greatly to the value of this issue of “Alf Laylah wa Laylah.” Some of these are
startling in their realism, and often the traveller who believed that he knew something
of the East, winces at the plainness with which the Wazir’s daughter tells her tales to
Shahryar, King of the Banu Sasan. The language is, however, more frequently
coarse than loose, and smacks more of the childish plainness with which high and low
talk in the family circles from Tangier to Malaysia, than of prurience or suggestiveness.
The Oriental cannot understand that it is improper to refer in straightforward terms to
anything which Allah has created, or of which the Kuran treats. But in his conversation,
as in his folk-lore, there is no subtle corruption or covert licentiousness—none
of the vicious suggestion and false sentiment that pervade so many of the productions
of the modern romantic school.</p>

<p class="c012">It is, indeed, questionable whether there is much in these inimitable romances half
so objectionable as many of the chapters in Rabelais and Boccaccio. Nor do the
most archaic of the passages which Captain Burton declines to “veil in the decent
obscurity of a learned language” leave much room for the admirers of Shakespeare, or
Greene, or Nash, or Wycherley, or Swift, or Sterne to cry shame. Their coarseness
was a reflection of the times. The indelicacy was not offensive to those who heard it.
On the other hand, apart from the language, the general tone of “The Nights” is
exceptionally high and pure. The devotional fervour, as Captain Burton justly claims,
often rises to the boiling-point of fanaticism, and the pathos is sweet and deep, genuine
and tender, simple and true. Its life—strong, splendid, and multitudinous—is everywhere
flavoured with that unaffected pessimism and constitutional melancholy which strike
deepest root under the brightest skies. The Kazi administers poetical justice with
exemplary impartiality; and so healthy is the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> that at times we descry through the
voluptuous and libertine picture “vistas of a transcendental morality—the morality of
Socrates in Plato.” In no other work of the same nature is Eastern life so vividly
pourtrayed. We see the Arab Knight, his prowess and his passion for adventure, his
love and his revenge, the craft of his wives, and the hypocrisy of his priests, as plainly
as if we had lived among them. Gilded palaces, charming women, lovely gardens, caves
full of jewels, and exquisite repasts, captivate the senses and give variety to the panorama
which is passing before our eyes. Yet we repeat that, though there is much in the
excellent version now begun which is very plain speaking, there is nothing intentionally
demoralising. Evidently, however, the translator is prepared to hear this charge brought
against his labour of love. Indeed, there is a tinge of melancholy pervading the preface
in which the Editor refers to his “unsuccessful professional life,” and to the knowledge
of which his country has cared so little to avail itself. * * * *
Even in the recent Egyptian troubles—which are referred to somewhat bitterly—his wisdom
was not utilised, though, after the death of Major Morice, there was not an English official
in the camps before Suakin capable of speaking Arabic. On this scandal, and on the
ignorance of Oriental customs which was everywhere displayed, Captain Burton is
deservedly severe. The issue of the ten volumes now in the press, accompanied by notes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_398">398</span>so full of learning as those with which they are illuminated, will surely give the nation
an opportunity for wiping away the reproach of that neglect which Captain Burton seems
to feel more keenly than he cares to express.</p>

<p class="c000">This was a sop to the friend and a sore blow dealt to the enemy. Moreover
it was speedily followed up by another as swashing and trenchant in
the <cite>Morning Advertiser</cite> (September 15, ’85), of which long extracts are
presently quoted. The journal was ever friendly to me during the long
reign of Mr. James Grant, and became especially so when the editorial
chair was so worthily filled by my old familiar of Oxford days, the late
Alfred Bate Richards, a man who made the “Organ of the Licensed
Victuallers” a power in the state and was warmly thanked for his good
services by that model conservative, Lord Beaconsfield.</p>

<p class="c000">A phrase in the <cite>Standard</cite>, the “most archaic of the passages,” acted
upon</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite>THE "PALL MALL GAZETTE"</cite></h3>

<p class="c027">like a red rag upon a rageous bull. I should rather say that it excited the
so-called “Sexual Journal” by suggesting another opportunity for its unclean
sensationalism: perhaps also the staff hoped to provide company and a
fellow-sufferer for their editor, who was then in durance vile, his offences
being “inciting to an indecent assault” and an act of criminal immorality.
I should not have felt called upon to remind my readers of a scandal half-forgotten
in England, while still held in lively remembrance by the jealous
European world, had not the persistent fabrications, calumnies, and
slanders of the <cite>Pall Mall</cite>, which continue to this day, compelled me to
move in self-defence, and to explain the mean underlying motives.</p>

<p class="c000">Some three years and a half ago (June 3, ’85), the paper startled the
world of London by a prodigy of false, foul, and fulsome details in the
shape of articles entitled “The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon.”
The object of the editor, Mr. William T. Stead, a quondam teacher in
the London schools and a respectable Methodist strengthened by non-Conformist
support, in starting this ignoble surprise on the public was
much debated. His partisans asserted that he had been honestly deceived
by some designing knave—as if such child-like credulity were any excuse for
a veteran journalist! His foes opined that under the cloak of a virtue, which
Cato never knew, he sought to quicken his subscription-list ever dwindling
under the effects of his exaggerated Russophilism and Anglophobia.</p>

<p class="c000">But whatever may have been the motive, the effect was deplorable.
The articles, at once collected into a pamphlet (price twopence), as
the “Report of the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette’s</cite> Secret Commission,” and headed
by a laudatory quotation from one of the late Lord Shaftesbury’s
indiscreetly philanthropic speeches, were spread broadcast about every
<span class="pageno" id="Page_399">399</span>street and lane in London. The brochure of sixteen pages divided into
three chapters delighted the malignant with such sensational section-headings
as—How Girls are Bought and Ruined—Why the Cries of the
Victims are not Heard—Procuresses in the West End—How Annie was
Procured—You Want a Maid, do You?—The Ruin of Children—A
London Minotaur (?)—The Ruin of the Young Life—The Demon Child
and—A Close Time for Girls, the latter being intended to support the
recommendation of the Lords’ Committee and the promise of a Home
Secretary that the age of consent be raised from thirteen to sixteen. And
all this catchpenny stuff (price 2d.) ended characteristically with “Philanthropic
and Religious Associations can be supplied with copies of this
reprint <em>on special terms</em>.” Such artless benevolence and disinterested beneficence
must, of course, be made to pay.</p>

<p class="c000">Read by every class and age in the capital, the counties and the
colonies, this false and filthy scandal could not but infect the very children
with the contagion of vice. The little gutter-girls and street-lasses of East
London looked at men passing-by as if assured that their pucelages were
or would become vendible at £3 to £5. But, the first startling over, men
began to treat the writer as he deserved. The abomination was “boycotted”
by the Press, expelled the clubs, and driven in disgrace from the
“family breakfast-table,” an unpleasant predicament for a newspaper
which lives, not by its news, but by its advertisements. The editor had
the impudence to bemoan a “conspiracy of silence,” which can only mean
that he wanted his foul sheets to be bought and discussed when the public
thought fit to bury them in oblivion. And yet he must have known that
his “Modern Babylon” is not worse in such matters than half-a-dozen
minor Babylons scattered over Europe, Asia, and America; and that it is
far from being, except by the law of proportion, the “greatest market of
human flesh in the world.” But by carefully and curiously misrepresenting
the sporadic as the systematic, and by declaring that the “practice of
procuration has been reduced to a science” (instead of being, we will
suppose, one of the fine arts), it is easy to make out a case of the grossest
calumny and most barefaced scandal against any great capital.</p>

<p class="c000">The revelations of the <cite>Pall Mall</cite> were presently pooh-pooh’d at home;
but abroad their effect was otherwise. Foreigners have not yet learned
thoroughly to appreciate our national practice of washing (and suffering
others to wash) the foulest linen in fullest public. Mr. Stead’s unworthy
clap-trap representing London as the head-quarters of kidnapping, hocussing,
and child-prostitution, the author invoking the while with true
Pharisaic righteousness, unclean and blatant, pure intentions and holy
zeal for good works, was welcomed with a shout of delight by our unfriends
the French, who hold virtue in England to be mostly Tartuffery,
and by our cousins-german and rivals the Germans, who dearly love to use
us and roundly abuse us. In fact, the national name of England was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_400">400</span>wilfully and wrongfully defiled and bewrayed by a “moral and religious”
Englishman throughout the length and breadth of Europe.</p>

<p class="c000">Hard upon those “revelations” comes the Eliza Armstrong case
whereby the editor of the “Sexual Gazette” stultified thoroughly and
effectually his own assertions; and proved most satisfactorily, to the
injury of his own person, that the easiest thing in the world is notably
difficult and passing dangerous. An accomplice, unable to procure a
“maiden” for immoral purposes after boasting her ability as a procuress,
proceeded to kidnap one for the especial benefit of righteous Mr. Stead.
Consequently, he found himself in the dock together with five other
accused, male and female; and the verdict, condemning the arch-plotter
to three months and the assistants to lesser terms of imprisonment for
abduction and indecent assault, was hailed with universal applause. The
delinquent had the fanatical and unscrupulous support, with purse and
influence, of the National Vigilance Association, a troop of busybodies
captained by licensed blackmailers who of late years have made England
their unhappy hunting-ground.<a id="r447"></a><a href="#f447" class="c011"><sup>[447]</sup></a> Despite, however, the “Stead Defence
Fund” liberally supplied by Methody; despite the criminal’s Pecksniffian
tone, his self-glorification of the part he had taken, his <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">effronté</span></i> boast of
pure and lofty motives and his passionate enthusiasm for sexual morality,
the trial emphasised the fact that no individual may break the law of
the land in order that good may come therefrom. It also proved most
convincingly the utter baselessness of the sweeping indictment against
the morality of England and especially of London—a charge which
“undoubtedly had an enormous influence for harm at home and cruelly
prejudiced the country abroad.” In the words of Mr. Vaughan of the
Bow Street Police Court (September 7, ’85) the <cite>Pall Mall’s</cite> “Sensational
articles had certainly given unlimited pain and sorrow to many good
people at home and had greatly lowered the English nation in the
estimation of foreigners.” In a sequel to the Eliza Armstrong case Mr.
Justice Manisty, when summing up, severely condemned the “shocking
exhibition that took place in the London streets by the publication of
statements containing horrible details, and he trusted that those who were
responsible for the administration of the law would take care that such
outrage should not be permitted again.” So pure and pious Mr. Stead found
time for reflection during the secluded three-months life of a “first-class
misdemeanant” in “happy Holywell,” and did not bring out his intended
<span class="pageno" id="Page_401">401</span>articles denouncing London as the head-quarters of a certain sin named
from Sodom.</p>

<p class="c000">About mid-September, when Mr. Stead still lay in durance vile, a
sub-editor Mr. Morley (Jun.) applied to me for an interview which I did
not refuse. It was by no means satisfactory except to provide his paper
with “copy.” I found him labouring hard to place me “in the same
box” with his martyred principal and to represent my volume (“a book
of archaic delights”) as a greater outrage on public decency than the
two-penny pamphlet. This, as said the <cite>London Figaro</cite> (September 19,
’85), is a “monstrous and absurd comparison.” It became evident to me,
during the first visit, that I was to play the part of Mr. Pickwick between
two rival races of editors, the pornologists and the anti-pornologists; and,
having no stomach for such sport I declined the rôle. In reply to a question
about critics my remark to the interviewer was, “I have taken much
interest in what the classics call Skiomachia and I shall allow <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anonymus</span>
and <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Anonyma</span> to howl unanswered. I shall also treat with scornful silence
the miserables who, when shown a magnificent prospect, a landscape
adorned with the highest charms of Nature and Art, can only see in a
field corner here and there a little heap of muck. ‘You must have been
looking for it, Madam!’ said, or is said to have said, sturdy old Doctor
Samuel Johnson.”</p>

<p class="c000">Moreover Mr. Morley’s style of reporting “interviews” was somewhat
too advanced and American—that is, too personal, too sensation-mongering
and too nauseously familiar—to suit my taste; and I would
have none other of them. Hereupon being unable to make more copy
out of the case the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> let loose at me a German Jew
penny-a-liner, who signs himself Sigma. This <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre diable</span></i> delivered
himself of two articles, “Pantagruelism or Pornography?” (September 14,
’85) and “The Ethics of the Dirt” (September 19, ’85), wherein with
matchless front of brass he talks of the “unsullied British breakfast-table,”
so pleasantly provided with pepper by his immaculate editor. And since
that time the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> has never ceased to practise at my expense
its old trade, falsehood and calumny, and the right of private judgment,
sentence and execution. In hopes that his splenatic and vindictive fiction
might bear fruit, at one time the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> has “heard that the
work was to be withdrawn from circulation” (when it never circulated).
Then, “it was resolved by the authorities to request Captain Burton not to
issue the third volume and to prosecute him if he takes no notice of the
invitation;” and, finally, “Government has at last determined to put
down Captain Burton with a strong hand.” All about as true as the
political articles which the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> indites with such heroic
contempt for truth, candour and honesty. One cannot but apply to the
“Gutter Gazette” the words of the Rev. Edward Irving:—“I mean by
the British Inquisition that court whose ministers and agents carry on
<span class="pageno" id="Page_402">402</span>their operations in secret; who drag every man’s most private affairs
before the sight of thousands and seek to mangle and destroy his life,
trying him without a witness, condemning him without a hearing, nor
suffering him to speak for himself; intermeddling in things of which
they have no knowledge and cannot on any principle have a jurisdiction. * * * I mean the ignorant, unprincipled, unhallowed spirit of criticism,
which in this Protestant country is producing as foul effects against truth,
and by as dishonest means as ever did the Inquisition of Rome” (p. 5
“Preliminary Discourse to Ben Ezra,” etc.).</p>

<p class="c000">Of course men were not wanting to answer the malevolent insipidities
of the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, and to note the difference between newspaper
articles duly pamphleted and distributed to the disgust of all decency, and
the translation of an Arabian classic, limited in issue and intended only for
the few select. Nor could they fail to observe that blackballing the
Nights and admitting the “revelations” was a desperate straining at the
proverbial gnat and swallowing the camel. My readers will hardly thank
me for dwelling upon this point yet I cannot refrain from quoting certain
of the protests:—</p>

<p class="c012">Your correspondent “Sigma” has forgotten the considerable number of
“students” who will buy Captain Burton’s translation as the only literal one, needing
it to help them in what has become necessary to many—a masterly knowledge of
Egyptian Arabic. The so-called “Arabian Nights” are about the only written halfway
house between the literary Arabic and the colloquial Arabic, both of which they
need, and need introductions too. I venture to say that its largest use will be as a
grown-up school-book, and that it is not coarser than the classics in which we soak all
our boys’ minds at school.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">And the <cite>Freethinker’s</cite> answer (Oct. 25, ’85) to these repeated and malicious
assaults is as follows:—</p>

<p class="c012">Here is a fine illustration of Mr. Stead’s Pecksniffian peculiarities. Captain Burton,
a gentleman and a scholar whose boots Mr. Stead is not fit to black, is again hauled
over the coals for the hundredth time, about his new translation of the Arabian Nights,
which is so “pornographic” that the price of the first volume has actually risen from a
pound to twenty-five shillings. Further down, in the very same column, the <cite>P.M.G.</cite>
gloats proudly over the fact that thirty-five shillings have been given for a single copy
of its own twopennyworth of smut.</p>

<p class="c000">The last characteristic touch which I shall take the trouble to notice is the
following gem of September 16, ’87:—</p>

<p class="c012">I was talking to an American novelist the other day, and he assured me that the
Custom-house authorities on “the other side” seized all copies of Sir Richard Burton’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_403">403</span>“Nights” that came into their hands, and retained them as indecent publications.
Burned them, I hope he meant, and so, I fear, will all holders of this notorious publication,
for prices will advance, and Sir Richard will chuckle to think that indecency is a
much better protection than international copyright.</p>

<p class="c000">Truly the pen is a two-edged tool, often turned by the fool against his
own soul. So an honest author “chuckles” when his subscribers have
lost their copies <em>because</em> this will enhance the value of his book! I ask,
Can anything be better proven than the vileness of a man who is ever
suspecting and looking for vileness in his fellow-men? Again, the
assertion that the Custom-house authorities in the United States had
seized my copies is a Pall-Mallian fiction pure and simple, and the “Sexual
Gazette” must have known this fact right well. In consequence of a complaint
lodged by the local Society for the Suppression of Vice, the officials
of the Custom-house, New York, began by impounding the first volumes
of the Villon Version; but presently, as a literary friend informs me
(February 10, ’88), “the new translations of The Nights have been fully
permitted entry at the Custom-house and are delivered on the payment of
25% duty.” To my copies admittance was never refused.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Stead left his prison-doors noisily declaring that the rest of his
life should be “devoted to Christian chivalry”—whatever that majestic
dictum may mean. As regards his subsequent journalistic career I can
observe only that it has been unfortunate as inconsequent. He took up
the defence, abusing the Home Secretary after foulest fashion, of the coldblooded
murderer Lipski, with the result that his protégé was hanged
after plenary confession and the Editor had not the manliness to apologise.
He espoused the cause of free speech in Ireland with the result
that most of the orators were doomed to the infirmaries connected with
the local gaols. True to his principle made penal by the older and wiser
law of libel, that is of applying individual and irresponsible judgment to,
and passing final and unappealable sentence upon, the conduct of private
individuals and of public men, he raged and inveighed with all the fury of
outraged (and interested) virtue against Colonel Hughes-Hallett with the
consequence of seating that M.P. more firmly than before. He took up the
question of free public meeting in England with the result that a number
of deludeds (including Mr. Cunninghame Graham, M.P.) found their way
to prison, which the “Christian chevalier” had apparently contracted to
supply with inmates. But there is more to say concerning the vaunted
morality of this immoral paper.—<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eheu! quantum mutatus</span> from the old
decent days when, under Mr. Frederic Greenwood, it was indeed “written
by gentlemen for gentlemen” (and ladies).</p>

<p class="c000">A journal which, like the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>, affects preferably and
persistently sexual subjects and themes lubric, works more active and
permanent damage to public morals than books and papers which are
frankly gross and indecent. The latter, so far as the world of letters
<span class="pageno" id="Page_404">404</span>knows them, are read either for their wit and underlying wisdom (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>
Rabelais and Swift), for their historical significance (Petronius Arbiter)
or for their anthropological interest as the Alf Laylah. But the public
print which deals, however primly and decently, piously and unctuously
with sexual and intersexual relations, usually held to be of the Alekta
or taboo’d subjects, is the real perverter of conduct, the polluter of mental
purity, the corrupter-general of society. Amongst savages and barbarians
the comparatively unrestrained intercourse between men and women
relieves the brain through the body; the mind and memory have scant
reason, physical or mental, to dwell fondly upon visions amatory and
venereal, to live in a “rustle of (imaginary) copulation.” On the other
hand the utterly artificial life of civilisation, which debauches even the
monkeys in “the Zoo,” and which expands the period proper for the reproductory
process from the vernal season into the whole twelvemonth, leaves
to the many, whose lot is celibacy, no bodily want save one and that in
a host of cases either unattainable or procurable only by difficulty and
danger. Hence the prodigious amount of mental excitement and material
impurity which is found wherever civilisation extends, in maid, matron,
and widow, save and except those solely who allay it by some counteragent—religion,
pride, or physical frigidity. How many a woman in
“Society,” when stricken by insanity or puerperal fever, breaks out into
language that would shame the slums and which makes the hearers marvel
where she could have learned such vocabulary. How many an old maid
held to be cold as virgin snow, how many a matron upon whose fairest
fame not a breath of scandal has blown, how many a widow who proudly
claims the title <em>univira</em>, must relieve their pent-up feelings by what may
be called mental prostitution. So I would term the dear delights of
sexual converse and that sub-erotic literature, the phthisical “French
novel,” whose sole merit is “suggestiveness,” taking the place of Oriental
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">morosa voluptas</span></i> and of the unnatural practices—Tribadism and so forth,
still rare, we believe, in England. How many hypocrites of either sex,
who would turn away disgusted from the outspoken Tom Jones or the
Sentimental Voyager, revel in and dwell fondly upon the sly romance or
“study” of character whose profligacy is masked and therefore the more
perilous. And a paper like the (modern) <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> which
deliberately pimps and panders to this latent sense and state of aphrodisiac
excitement, is as much the more infamous than the loose book as
hypocrisy is more hateful than vice and prevarication is more ignoble
than a lie. And when such vile system is professionally practised under
the disguise and in the holy names of Religion and Morality, the effect is
loathsome as that spectacle sometimes seen in the East of a wrinkled
old eunuch garbed in woman’s nautch-dress ogling with painted eyes and
waving and wriggling like a young Bayadère.</p>

<p class="c000">There is much virtue in a nickname: at all events it shows the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_405">405</span>direction whither the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">aura popularis</span></i> sets. The organ of Christian
Chivalry is now universally known to Society as “The Gutter Gazette;”
to the public as “The Purity-Severity Paper,” and the “Organ of the
Social Pruriency Society,” and to its colleagues of the Press as “The
Dirt-Squirt.” In the United States fulsomely to slander a man is “to
Pall Mall Gazette him:” “Just like your <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>,” said an
American to me when describing a disreputable print “over the water.”
And Mr. Stead, now self-constituted coryphæus of the Reptile Press in
Great Britain, has apparently still to learn that lying and slandering are
neither Christian nor chivalrous.</p>

<p class="c000">The diminutive <cite>Echo</cite> of those days (October 13 and 14, ’85) followed
suit of the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> and caught lightly the sounds as they fell
from the non-melliferous lips of the charmer who failed to charm wisely.
The precious article begins by informing me that I am “always eager after
the sensational,” and that on this occasion I “cater for the prurient
curiosity of the wealthy few,” such being his synonym for “readiness to
learn.” And it ends with the following comical colophon:—“Captain
Burton may possibly imitate himself (?) and challenge us (!) to mortal
combat for this expression of opinion.” If so, the writer of these lines
will imitate himself (?) and take no notice of such an epistle. The poor
scribe suggests the proverbial “Miss Baxter, who refused a man before
he axed her.” And what weapon could I use, composing-stick or dung-fork
upon an anonymous correspondent of the hawkers’ and newsboys’
“Hecker,” the favourite ha’porth of East London? So I left him to the
tender mercies of Gaiety (October 14, ’84):—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The <cite>Echo</cite> is just a bit wild</div>
      <div class="line in2">Its “par.” is indeed, a hard hitter:</div>
      <div class="line">In fact, it has not drawn it mild;</div>
      <div class="line in2">’Tis a matter of “Burton and bitter.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">I rejoice to subjoin that the <cite>Echo</cite> has now (1888) made a name for decent
and sensible writing, having abandoned the “blatant” department to the
<cite>Star</cite> (see, for the nonsense about a non-existent Alderman Waterlow its
issue of Sept. 6, ’88).</p>

<p class="c000">In the opinions of the Press will be found a selection from half
a century of laudatory notices to which the few curious touching such
matters will turn, while those who misjudged my work are duly acknowledged
in this paper. Amongst friends I would specify, without invidious
distinction, <cite>The Bat</cite> (September 29, ’85), who on this occasion and
sundry others sturdily defended me, showing himself a bird of “light
and leading.” To the <cite>St. James’s Gazette</cite> (September 12, ’85), the
<cite>Whitehall Review</cite> (September 17), the <cite>Home News</cite> (September 18), and
the <cite>Nottingham Journal</cite> (September 19), I am also indebted for most
appreciative and intelligent notices. My cordial thanks are likewise due
<span class="pageno" id="Page_406">406</span>to the Editor and especially to “Our London Correspondent” of the
<cite>Lincoln Gazette</cite> (October 10 and November 2, ’85, not to notice sundry
minor articles): the articles will be reprinted almost entire because they
have expressed my meaning as though it came from my own mouth. I
have quoted Mr. J. Addington Symonds <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">in extenso</span></i>: if England now possess
a writer who can deliver an authoritative judgment on literary style it is this
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i>. Of the journals which profess letters <cite>The Academy</cite> has ever
been my friend and I have still the honour of corresponding with it: we
are called “faddists” probably from our “fad” of signing our articles and
thus enabling the criticised to criticise the critic.</p>

<p class="c000">I now turn to another of my unfriends, amongst whom is and long has
been</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite>THE “SATURDAY REVIEW.”</cite></h3>

<p class="c027">This ancient dodderer, who has seen better days, deigned favour me
with six notices (January 2 and March 27, ’86; April 30, June 4, August
14, ’87; and July 21, ’88), of which No. i., dealing with my first and
second volumes, is written after the facile American fashion making
the book review itself; that is supply to the writer all the knowledge
and familiarity with the subject which he parades before an incurious and
easily gullible public. This especial form of dishonesty has but lately
succeeded to and ousted the classical English critique of Jeffrey, Macaulay,
and the late Mr. Abraham Hayward, which was mostly a handy peg for the
contents of the critic’s noddle or note book. The Saturnine article
opens characteristically.</p>

<p class="c012">Abroad we English have the character of being the most prudish of nations; we
are celebrated as having Bowdlerized for our babes and sucklings even the immortal
William Shakspeare; but we shall infallibly lose this our character should the Kamashastra
Society flourish. Captain Burton has long been known as a bold explorer; his
pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina, disguised in the dress and taking on him the manners
and customs of a True Believer, was a marvel of audacity; but perhaps he may be held
now to have surpassed himself, for he has been bold enough to lay before his countrymen
a literal and unexcised translation of <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>.</p>

<p class="c000">The writer is kind enough to pat me upon the back for “picturesque and
fluent English” and to confess that I have successfully imitated the
rhyming cadence of the original. But <cite>The Saturday</cite> would not be <cite>The
Saturday</cite> without carping criticism, wrong-headedness and the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">culte</span></i> of the
commonplace, together with absolute and unworthy cruelty to weaker
vessels. The reviewer denounces as “too conceited to be passed over
without comment” the good old English “whenas” (for when, vol. ii. 130),
the common ballad-term “a plump of spearmen” (ii. 190) and a “red
<span class="pageno" id="Page_407">407</span>cent” (i. 321), the only literal rendering of “Fals ahmar” which serves
to show the ancient and noble pedigree of a slang term supposed to be
modern and American. Moreover this Satan even condemns fiercely the
sin of supplying him with “useful knowledge.” The important note
(ii. 45) upon the normal English mispronunciation of the J in Jerusalem,
Jesus, Jehovah, a corruption whose origin and history are unknown to so
many and which was, doubtless, a surprise to this Son of King “We,” is
damned as “uninteresting to the reader of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.” <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En
revanche</span></i>, three mistakes of mine (“p. 43” for “p. 45”) in vol. ii., index;
“King Zahr Shah” for King Suleyman Shah (ii. 285) and the careless
confusion of the Caliphs Al-Muntasir and Al-Mustansir (ii. 817, note i.)
were corrected and I have duly acknowledged the correction. No. i.
article ends with Saturnine geniality and utterly ignoring a bye-word
touching dwellers in glass houses:—</p>

<p class="c012">Finally, we mark with regret that Captain Burton should find no more courteous
terms to apply to the useful work of a painstaking clergyman than those where in his
note he alludes to “Missionary Porter’s miserable Handbook.”</p>

<p class="c000">As Mr. Missionary Porter has never ceased to malign me, even in his last
Edition of Murray’s “miserable Handbook,” a cento of Hibernian
blunders and hashed Bible, I have every reason to <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lui rendre la pareille</span></i>.</p>

<p class="c000">The second article (March 27, ’86), treating of vol. iii., opens with one
of those plagiaristic commonplaces, so dear to the soul of <cite>The Saturday</cite>,
in its staid and stale old age as in its sprightly youth. “There is
particularly one commodity which all men, therein nobly disregarding
their differences of creed and country, are of a mind that it is better to
give than to receive. That commodity is good advice. We note further
that the liberality with which this is everywhere offered is only to be
equalled (he means ‘to be equalled only’) by the niggard reception at
most times accorded to the munificent donation; in fact the very goodness
of advice—given apparently militates against its due appreciation in (by?)
the recipient.” The critic then proceeds to fit his <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ipse dixit</span></i> upon my case.
The sense of the sentiment is the reverse of new: we find in <cite>The
Spectator</cite> (No. dxii.), “There is nothing we receive with so much reluctance
as good advice,” etc.; but Mr. <cite>Spectator</cite> writes good English and
his plagiarist does not. Nor is the dictum true. We authors who have
studied a subject for years, are, I am convinced, ready enough to learn,
but we justly object to sink our opinions and our judgment in those of a
counsellor who has only “crammed” for his article. Moreover, we must
be sure that he can fairly lay claim to the three requisites of an adviser—capacity
to advise rightly, honesty to advise truly and courtesy to advise
decently. Now the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> has neither this, that, nor the other
qualification. Indeed his words read like subtle and lurking irony by the
light of those phenomenal and portentous vagaries which ever and anon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_408">408</span>illuminate his opaque pages. What correctness can we expect from a
journal whose tomahawk-man, when scalping the corpse of Matthew
Arnold, deliberately applies the term “sonnet” to some thirty lines in
heroic couplets? His confusion of Dr. Jenner, the Vaccinator, with Sir
William Jenner, the President of the R. C. of Physicians, is one which
passes all comprehension. And what shall we say of this title to pose as
an Aristarchus (November 4th, ’82)? “Then Jonathan Scott, LL.D.
Oxon, assures the world that he intended to re-translate the Tales given
by Galland (!); but he found Galland so adequate on the whole (!!) that
he gave up the idea and now reprints Galland with etchings by M. Lalauze,
giving a French view of Arab life. Why Jonathan Scott, LL.D., should
have thought to better Galland while Mr. Lane’s version is in existence,
and has just been reprinted, it is impossible to say.” In these wondrous
words Jonathan Scott’s editio princeps with engravings from pictures by
Smirke and printed by Longmans in 1811 is confounded with the imperfect
reprint by Messieurs Nimmo and Bain, in 1883; the illustrations being
borrowed from M. Adolphe Lalauze, a French artist (nat. 1838), a master
of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eaux fortes</span></i>, who had studied in Northern Africa and who maroccanized
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mise-en-scène</span></i> of “The Nights” with a marvellous contrast of white and
negro nudities. And such is the Solomon who fantastically complains
that I have disdained to be enlightened by his “modest suggestions.”
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Au reste</span></i> the article is not bad simply because it borrows—again
Americanicè—all its matter from my book. At the tail-end, however,
comes the normal sting: I am guilty of not explaining “Wuzú” (lesser
ablution), “Ghusl” (greater ablution) and “Zakát” (legal alms which constitute
a poor-rate) proving that the writer never read vol. iii. He
confidently suggests replacing “Cafilah,” “by the better-known word
<em>Caravan</em>,” as if it were my speciality (as it is his) to hunt-out commonplaces:
he grumbles about “interrogation-<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">points à l’Espagnole</span></i> upside-down”
(Â¿) which still satisfies me as an excellent substitute to distinguish
the common Q(uestion) from A(nswer); and he seriously congratulates
me upon my discovering a typographical error on the fly-leaf.</p>

<p class="c000">No. iii. (August 14, ’86, handling vols. vi. vii. and viii.) is free from the
opening pretensions and absurdities of No. ii. and it is made tolerably
safe by the familiar action of scissors and paste. But—desinit in piscem—it
ends fishily; and we find, after saturnine fashion <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">in cauda venenum</span></i>.
It scolds me for telling the English public what it even now ignores, the
properest way of cooking meat (à propos of kabábs) and it “trembles to
receive vols. ix. and x. for truly (from a literary point of view, of course,
we mean) there seems nothing of which the translator might not be
capable”—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">capable de tout</span></i>, as said Voltaire of Habbakuk and another
agnostic Frenchman of the Prophet Zerubbabel. This was indeed high
praise considering the <em>Saturday’s</em> sympathy with and affection for the dead
level, for the average man; but as an augury of ill it was a brutum fulmen.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_409">409</span>No. iv. (August 30, ’87) was, strange to say, in tone almost civil and
ended with a touch simulating approval:—</p>

<p class="c012">“The labours of a quarter of a century,” writes the translator in <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’Envoi</span></cite>, are now
brought to a close, and certainly no one could have been found better suited by education
and taste to the task of translating the ‘Nights’ than is the accomplished author of the
‘Pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina.’ His summing up of the contents and character
of ‘The Thousand and One Nights’ in the Terminal Essay is a masterpiece of careful
analysis, and we cannot do better than conclude our notice with a paragraph that resumes
with wonderful effect the boundless imagination and variety of the picture that is conjured
up before our eyes:—</p>

<p class="c012">“Viewed as a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> in full and complete form, they are a drama of Eastern
life, and a Dance of Death made sublime by faith and the highest emotions, by the
certainty of expiation and the fulness of atoning equity, where virtue is victorious, vice
is vanquished, and the ways of Allah are justified to man. They are a panorama which
remains ken-speckle upon the mental retina. They form a phantasmagoria in which
archangels and angels, devils and goblins, men of air, of fire, of water, naturally mingle
with men of earth; where flying horses and talking fishes are utterly realistic; where
King and Prince must meet fishermen and pauper, lamia and cannibal; where citizen
jostles Badawi, eunuch meets knight; the Kazi hob-nobs with the thief.... The
work is a kaleidoscope where everything falls into picture; gorgeous palaces and
pavilions; grisly underground caves and deadly wolds; gardens fairer than those of the
Hesperid; seas dashing with clashing billows upon enchanted mountains; valleys of the
Shadow of Death; air-voyages and promenades in the abysses of the ocean; the duello,
the battle, and the siege; the wooing of maidens and the marriage rite. All the
splendour and squalor, the beauty and baseness, the glamour and grotesqueness, the
magic and the mournfulness, the bravery and the baseness of Oriental life are here.”</p>

<p class="c000">And now, after the <cite>Saturday Review</cite> has condescended severely and sententiously
to bepreach me, I must be permitted a trifling return in kind.
As is declared by the French, an objectionable people which prefers
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la gloire</span></i> to “duty,” and even places “honour” before “honesty,” the
calling of the Fourth Estate is <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">un sacerdoce</span></i>, an Apostolate: it is a high
and holy mission whose ends are the diffusion of Truth and Knowledge
and the suppression of Ignorance and Falsehood. “Sacrilege,”
with this profession, means the breaking of its two great commandments
and all sins of commission and omission suggested and prompted by vain
love of fame, by sordid self-esteem or by ignoble rancour. What then
shall we say of a paper which, professedly established to “counteract the
immorality of <cite>The Times</cite>,” adds to normal journalistic follies, offences and
mistakes an utter absence of literary honour, systematic misrepresentation,
malignity and absolute ruffianism? Let those who hold such language
exaggerated glance at my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièce justicative</span></i>, the <em>Saturday’s</em> article (June 28,
88) upon Mr. Hitchman’s “Biography of Sir Richard Burton.” No
denizen of Grub Street in the coarse old day of British mob-savagery
could have produced a more damning specimen of wilful falsehood,
undignified scurrility and brutal malevolence, in order to gratify a well-known
pique, private and personal. The “Saturday Reviler”—there is,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_410">410</span>I repeat, much virtue in a soubriquet—has grown only somewhat feebler, not
kindlier, not more sympathetic since the clever author of “In Her Majesty’s
Keeping” styled this Magister Morum “the benignant and judicious
foster-parent of literature”; and since Darwin wrote of it (ii. 260) “One
cannot expect fairness in a reviewer;” nor has it even taken to heart what
my friend Swinburne declared (anent its issue of December 15, ’83)
“clumsy and shallow snobbery can do no harm.” Like other things
waxing obsolete it has served, I hasten to confess, a special purpose in the
world of letters. It has lived through a generation of thirty years in the
glorification of the mediocrities and in pandering to the impish taint of poor
human nature, the ungenerous passions of those who abhor the novel,
the original, the surprising, the startling, and who are only too glad
to witness and to assist in the Procrustes’ process of trimming and
lengthening out thoughts and ideas and diction that rise or strive to rise
above the normal and vulgar plane. This virtual descendant of the ancestral
Satirist, after long serving as a spawning-ground to envy, hatred and
malice, now enters upon the decline of an unworthy old age. Since the
death of its proprietor, Mr. Beresford-Hope, it has been steadily going
down hill as is proved by its circulation, once 15,000, and now something
nearer 5,000 than 10,000. It has become a poor shadow of its former
self—preserving the passive ill-will but lacking the power of active malevolence—when
journalists were often compelled to decline correspondence
upon its misjudgments and to close to complainants their columns which
otherwise would have been engrossed by just and reasonable protestations.
The “young lions” of its prime (too often behanged with a calf-skin on
their recreant limbs) are down among the dead and the jackal-pack which
has now taken up the howling could no longer have caused Thackeray to
fear or can excite the righteous disgust of that votary of “fair-play”—Mr.
John Bright.</p>

<p class="c000">And now, before addressing myself to another Reviewer, I would be
allowed a few words upon two purely personal subjects; the style chosen
for my translation and my knowledge of the Arabian language and
literature.</p>

<p class="c000">I need hardly waste time to point out what all men discern more or
less distinctly, how important are diction and expression in all works of
fancy and fiction and how both branches, poetic and prosaic, delight in
beauty adorned and allow in such matters the extreme of liberty. A long
study of Galland and Torrens, Lane and Payne, convinced me that none
of these translators, albeit each could claim his special merit, has
succeeded in preserving the local colouring of the original. The Frenchman
had gallicised and popularised the general tone and tenor to such
extent that even the vulgar English versions have ever failed to throw off
the French flavour. Torrens attempted literalism laudably and courageously
enough; but his execution was of the roughest, the nude verbatim;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_411">411</span>nor did his familiarity with Arabic, or rather with Egyptian, suffice him
for the task. Lane, of whom I have already spoken, and of whom I shall
presently be driven by his imprudent relatives and interested friends to
say more, affected the latinised English of the period, flat and dull, turgid
and vapid as that of Sale’s Koran; and his style proved the most
insufficient and inadequate attire in which an Oriental romance of the
Middle Ages could be arrayed. Payne was perfectly satisfactory to all
cultivated tastes, but he designedly converted a romantic into a classical
work: none ignores its high merits regarded merely as strong and vital
English, but it lacks one thing needful—the multiform variety of The
Nights. The original Arabic text which in the first thirteen tales
(Terminal Essay, p. 80) must date from before the <span class="fss">XIII</span>th century at the
latest (since Galland’s MS. in the Bibliothèque Nationale has been
assigned to the early <span class="fss">XIV</span>th) is highly composite: it does not disdain local
terms, bye-words and allusions (some obsolete now and forgotten), and it
borrows indiscriminately from Persian (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Sháhbandar), from Turkish
(as Khátún) and from Sanscrit (for instance Brahman). As its equivalent,
in vocabulary I could devise only a somewhat archaical English whose
old-fashioned and sub-antique flavour would contrast with our modern
and every-day speech, admitting at times even Latin and French terms,
such as <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">res scibilis</span></i> and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">citrouille</span></i>. The mixture startled the critics and
carpers to whom its object had not been explained; but my conviction
still remains that it represents, with much truth to nature, the motley
suit of the Arabo-Egyptian. And it certainly serves one purpose, too
often neglected by writers and unnoticed by reviewers. The fluent and
transparent styles of Buckle and Darwin (the modern Aristotle who has
transformed the face of Biological Science) are instruments admirably
fitted for their purpose: crystal-clear, they never divert even a bittock of
the reader’s brain from the all-important sense underlying the sound-symbols.
But in works of imagination man wants a treatment totally
different, a style which, by all or any means, little mattering what they
be, can avoid the imminent deadly risk of languor and monotony and
which adds to fluency the allurement of variety, of surprise and even of
disappointment, when a musical discord is demanded.</p>

<p class="c000">Again, my estimate of a translator’s office has never been of the low
level generally assigned to it even in the days when Englishmen were in the
habit of englishing every important or interesting work published on the
continent of Europe. We cannot expect at this period of our literature
overmuch from a man who, as Messieurs Vizetelly assure their <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span></i>,
must produce a version for a poor £20. But at his best the traducteur
while perfectly reproducing the matter and the manner of his original,
works upon two lines. His prime and primary object is an honest and
faithful copy, adding naught to the sense nor abating aught of its peculiar
cachet whilst he labours his best to please and edify his readers. He has
<span class="pageno" id="Page_412">412</span>however, or should have, another aim wherein is displayed the acme of
hermeneutic art. Every language can profitably lend something to and
borrow somewhat from its neighbours, near or far, an epithet, a metaphor,
a turn of phrase, a naïve idiom; and the translator of original mind will
not neglect the frequent opportunities of enriching his mother tongue
with alien and novel ornaments, which will justly be accounted barbarisms
until formally adopted and naturalised. Such are the “peoples” of
Kossuth and the useful “lengthy,” an American revival of a good old
English term. Nor will my modern versionist relegate to a foot-note, as
is the malpractice of his banal brotherhood, the interesting and often
startling phases of his foreign author’s phraseology and dull the text with
its commonplace English equivalent—thus doing the clean reverse of
what he should do. It is needless to quote instances concerning this
phase of “Bathos:” they abound in every occidental translation of
every Oriental work, especially the French, such as Baron de Slane’s
honest and conscientious “Ibn Khaldún.” It was this grand ideal of a
translator’s duty that made Eustache Deschamps, a contemporary poet,
write of his English brother bard:—</p>

<p class="c012">“GRAND TRANSLATOUR, NOBLE <em>GEOFFROY CHAUCIER</em>.”</p>

<p class="c013">Here,</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The firste finder of our faire langage”</div>

<p class="c000">is styled a “Socrates in philosophy, a Seneca in morals, an Angel in
conduct and a great Translator,” which apparent anti-climax has scandalised
not a little inditers of “Lives” and “Memoirs.” The title is given
simply because Chaucer translated (using the best and highest sense of
the term) into his English tongue and its linguistic peculiarities, the
thoughts and ideas of his foreign models—the very letter and spirit of
Petrarch and Boccaccio.</p>

<p class="c000">That my attempts to reproduce the form and features of the original
and that my manner of writing is well adapted to the matter appears
from the consensus of the “Notices” presently to be quoted. Mr.
J. Addington Symonds pronounces the version to be executed with
“peculiar literary vigour.” Mr. Swinburne is complimentary and even
the <cite>Saturday</cite> deigns to declare “Captain Burton is certainly felicitous in
the manner in which he has englished the picturesque lines of the
original.” But <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le style est de l’homme</span></i>; and this is a matter upon which
any and every educated man who writes honestly will form and express
and retain his own opinion: there are not a few who loathe “Pickwick,” and
who cannot relish <cite>Vanity Fair</cite>. So the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> No. 335 (pp. 174,
181), concerning which more anon, pronounces my work to be “a jumble
of the vulgarest slang of all nations;” also “an unreadable compound of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_413">413</span>archæology and ‘slang,’ abounding in Americanisms, and full of an
affected reaching after obsolete or foreign words and phrases;” and
finally shows the assurance to assert “Captain Burton has produced a
version which is neither Arabic nor English, but which has at least the
merit of being beautifully unreadable” (p. 182).</p>

<p class="c000">It has been circulated widely enough by the Lane-Poole clique—<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poules
mouillées</span></i> they are called by an Arabist friend—that I do not know Arabic.
Let me at once plead guilty to the charge, adding by way of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">circonstance
atténuante</span></i> that I know none who does know or who can thoroughly know
a tongue of which we may say as did honest Izaak Walton of other two crafts,
“angling be so like the mathematics that it can never be fully learned.”
Most of us can master one section of a language concerning which
those who use it vernacularly declare “Only Allah wotteth its entirety”;
but we lack as yet the means to study it as a whole. Older by long ages
than Babel’s fabulous Tower, and covering a continuous area from Eastern
Arabia to the Maghrab al-Aksá (western Mauritania), from Chaldæa in the
north to southern Zanzibar, it numbers of potential vocabulary 1,200,000
words all of which may be, if they are not, used; and while they
specify the finest shades of meaning, not a few of them, technically termed
“Zidd,” bear significations diametrically opposite, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, “Maulá” = lord,
slave; and “’Ajúz” with 88 different meanings. Its literature, poetic,
semi-poetic and prosaic, falls into three greater sections:—Ancient (The
Suspendeds, the Kitáb al-Aghání and the Koran), Mediæval (Al-Mutanabbi,
Al-Asm’ái, Abú Nowás and the poets of the Harunic cycle) and Moderns, of
whom not the least important (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Yúsuf al-Yazají) are those of our own day.
Throughout its vast domain there are local differences of terminology which
render every dialect a study; and of these many are intimately connected with
older families, as the Egyptian with Coptic and the Moorish with Berber.
The purest speakers are still the Badawín who are often not understood by
the citizen-folk (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> of Cairo, Damascus and Baghdad) at whose gates they
tent; and a few classes like the Banú Fahim of Al-Hijáz still converse
sub-classically, ever and anon using the terminal vowels and the nunnation
elsewhere obsolete. These wildlings, whose evening camp-fires are still
their schools for eloquence and whose improvisations are still their
unwritten laws, divide speech into three degrees; Al-’Áli the lofty
addressed to the great, Al-Wasat used for daily converse and Al-Dún the
lowly or broken “loghat” (jargon) belonging to most tribes save their
own. In Egypt the purest speakers are those of the Sa’íd—the upper
Nile-region—differing greatly from the two main dialects of the Delta: in
Syria, where the older Aramean is still current amongst sundry of the
villagers outlying Damascus, the best Arabists are the Druzes, a heterogeneous
amalgam of Arabs and Kurds who cultivate language with
uncommon care. Of the dialectic families which subtend the Mediterranean’s
southern sea-board, the Maroccan and the Algerine are
<span class="pageno" id="Page_414">414</span>barbarised by Berber, by Spanish and by Italian words and are roughened
by the inordinate use of the Sukún (quiescence or conjoining of consonants);
while the Tunisian approaches nearer to the Syrian and the Maltese was
originally Punic. The jargon of Meccah is confessedly of all the worst.
But the wide field has been scratched not worked out, and the greater
part of it, especially the Mesopotamian and the Himyaritic of Mahrahland,
still remains fallow and the reverse of sterile.</p>

<p class="c000">Materials for the study of Arabic in general and of its dialects in
particular are still deficient and the dictionaries mostly content themselves
with pouring old stuff from flask to flask, instead of collecting fresh and
unknown material. Such are recueils of prayers and proverbs, folk-songs
and stories, riddles and satires, not forgetting those polyglot vocabularies
so common in many parts of the Eastern world, notably in Sind and
Afghánistán; and the departmental glossaries such as the many dealing
with “Tasawwuf”—the Moslem form of Gnosticism. The excellent
lexicon of the late Professor Dozy, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Supplément aux Dictionnaires Arabes</span></cite>,
par R. Dozy, Leyde: E. J. Brill, 1881, was a step in advance; but we
still lack additions like Baron Adolph Von Kremer’s <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Beitrage zur
Arabischen Lexicographie</span></cite> (<i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">In commission bei Carl Gerold’s</span></i> Sohn, Wien, 1884.)
The French, as might be expected began early, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> M. Ruphy’s <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire
abrégé français-arabe, Paris, Imprimerie de la Republique, An 10</span></i>;
they have done good work in Algiers and are now carrying it on in Tunis.
Of these we have Marcel, <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vocabulaire</span></cite>, etc. (Paris, 1837); Bled de Braine
(Paris, 1846), who to his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cours Synthétique</span></cite> adds a study of Maroccan and
Egyptian; Professor Cherbonneau (Paris, 1854) <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Précis Historique</span></cite>, and
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dialogues</span></cite>, etc., (Alger, 1858); M. Gasselin (Paris, 1866) <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire
français-arabe</span></cite>; M. Brassier (Algiers, 1871) <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire pratique</span></cite> also
containing Algerine and Tunisian terms; General Parmentier (<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vocabulaire
arabe-français des Principaux Termes de Geógraphie</span></cite>, etc.: Paris, rue
Antoine-Dubois, 1882); and, to mention no others, the <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Grammaire Arabe
Vulgaire</span></cite> (Paris, 1824) of M. Caussin de Perceval (fils) has extended
far and wide. Berggren (Upsal, 1844) published his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guide Français-Arabe
des Voyageurs en Syrie et en Egypte</span></cite>. Rowland de Bussy printed
(Algiers, 1877) his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dialogues Français-Arabes</span></cite> in the Algerian dialect. Fr.
José de Lerchundi, a respected Missioner to Tangier has imitated and even
improved upon this in his <cite><span lang="es" xml:lang="es" xml:lang="es">Rudimentos del Arabe Vulgar</span></cite> (Madrid,
Rivadeneyra, 1872); and his studies of the Maghrabi dialect are most
valuable. Dr. A. Socin produced his <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Arabische Sprichwörter</span></cite>, etc.,
(Tubingen, 1878), and the late Wilhelm Spitta-Bey, whose early death
was so deeply lamented, left a grammar of Egyptian which would have been
a model had the author brought to his task more knowledge of Coptic in
his <i><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Grammatik des Arabischen vulgär dialektes von Ægypten, Leipzig</span></i>, 1870.
Dr. Landberg published with Brill of Leyden and Maisonneuve, of Paris,
1883, a volume of Syrian Proverbs and promises some five others—No. 2,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_415">415</span>Damascus and the Haurán; No. 3, Kasrawán and the Nusayriyah; No. 4,
Homs, Hamah and Halab (Aleppo), and No. 5, the Badawin of Syria.
It is evident that the process might be prolonged <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span></i> by a writer
of whom I shall have something to say presently. M. Clément Huart
(Jour. Asiat. Jan. ’83), has printed notes on the dialect of Damascus:
Dr. C. Snouck Hurgronje published a collection of 77 proverbs and
idioms with lengthy notes in his <cite><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mehkanische Sprichwörter</span></cite>, etc. (Haag,
Martinus Nijhoff, 1886), after being expelled from Meccah by the Turkish
authorities who had discovered him only through a Parisian journal <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le
Temps</span></cite> (see his <cite><span lang="nl" xml:lang="nl" xml:lang="nl">Het Mekkanshe Feest, Leyden</span></cite>, 1880). For the lower Najd
and upper Hijaz we have the glossary of Arabic words ably edited by Prof.
M. J. de Goeje in Mr. Charles M. Doughty’s valuable and fantastic
“Arabia Deserta” (ii. 542–690: see <cite>The Academy</cite>, July 28th, ’88). Thus
the local vocabularies are growing, but it will be long before the ground is
covered.</p>

<p class="c000">Again the East, and notably the Moslem East since the Massacre of
Damascus in 1860, although still moving slowly, shows a distinct advance.
The once secluded and self-contained communities are now shaken by the
repeated and continuous shocks of progress around them; and new wants
and strange objects compel them nilly-willy to provide vernacular
equivalents for the nomenclature of modern arts and sciences. Thus the
Orientalist, who would produce a contemporary lexicon of Persian, must
not only read up all the diaries and journals of Teheran and the vocabularies
of Yezd and Herat, he must go further a-field. He should make
himself familiar with the speech of the Iliyát or wandering pastoral tribes
and master a host of cognate tongues whose chiefs are Armenian (Old and
New), Caucasian, a modern Babel; Kurdish, Lúri (Bakhtiyári), Balochki
and Pukhtú or Afghan, besides the direct descendants of the Zend, the
Pehlevi, Dari and so forth. Even in the most barbarous jargons he will
find terms which throw light upon the literary Iranian of the lexicons: for
instance “Mádiyán” = a mare presupposes the existence of “Narayán” = a stallion, and the latter is preserved by the rude patois of the Baloch
mountaineers. This process of general collection would in our day best be
effected after the fashion of Professor James A. H. Murray’s “New
English Dictionary on Historical Principles.” It would be compiled by
a committee of readers resident in different parts of Persia, communicating
with the Royal Asiatic Society (whose moribund remains they might perhaps
quicken) and acting in co-operation with Russia, whom unfriends have
converted from a friend to an angry and jealous rival and who is ever so
forward in the linguistic field.</p>

<p class="c000">But if the model Persian dictionary have its difficulties, far harder will
be the task with Arabic which covers incomparably more ground. Here
we must begin with Spain and Portugal, Sardinia and the Balearics,
Southern Italy and Sicily; and thence pass over to Northern Africa and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_416">416</span>the two “Soudans,” the Eastern extending far South of the Equator and
the Western nearly to the Line. In Asia, besides the vast Arabian
Peninsula, numbering one million of square miles, we find a host of
linguistic outliers, such as Upper Hindostan, the Concan, Malacca, Java
and even remote Yun-nan, where al-Islam is the dominant religion, and
where Arabic is the language of Holy Writ.</p>

<p class="c000">My initiation into the mysteries of Arabic began at Oxford under my
tutor Dr. W. A. Greenhill, who published a “Treatise on Small-pox and
Measles,” translated from Rhazes—Abú Bakr al-Rází (London, 1847);
and where the famous Arabist, Don Pascual de Gayangos, kindly taught
me to write Arabic leftwards. During eight years of service in Western
India and in Moslem Sind, while studying Persian and a variety of vernaculars,
it was necessary to keep up and extend a practical acquaintance
with the language which supplies all the religious and most of the metaphysical
phraseology; and during my last year at Sindian Karáchí (1849),
I imported a Shaykh from Maskat. Then work began in downright
earnest. Besides Erpenius’ (D’Erp) “Grammatica Arabica,” Richardson,
De Sacy and Forbes, I read at least a dozen Perso-Arabic works (mostly
of pamphlet form) on “Sarf Wa Nahw”—Accidence and Syntax—and
learned by heart one-fourth of the Koran. A succession of journeys and
long visits at various times to Egypt, a Pilgrimage to the Moslem Holy
Land and an exploration of the Arabic-speaking Somáli-shores and Harar-Gay
in the Galla country of Southern Abyssinia, added largely to my
practice. At Aden, where I passed the official examination, Captain (now
Sir R. Lambert) Playfair and the late Rev. G. Percy Badger, to whom my
papers were submitted, were pleased to report favourably of my proficiency.
During some years of service and discovery in Western Africa and the
Brazil my studies were necessarily confined to the “Thousand Nights and
a Night;” and when a language is not wanted for use my habit is to forget
as much of it as possible, thus clearing the brain for assimilating fresh
matter. At the Consulate of Damascus, however, in West Arabian
Midian and in Maroccan Tangier the loss was readily recovered. In fact,
of this and sundry other subjects it may be said without immodesty that
I have forgotten as much as many Arabists have learned. But I repeat
my confession that I do not know Arabic and I have still to meet the
man who does know Arabic.</p>

<p class="c000">Orientalists, however, are like poets and musicians, a rageous race. A
passing allusion to a Swedish student styled by others (Mekkanische
Sprichwörter etc. p. 1) “Dr. Landberg” and by himself “Doctor Count
Carlo Landberg” procured me the surprise of the following communication.
I quote it in full because it is the only uncourteous attempt at
correspondence upon the subject of The Nights which has hitherto been
forced upon me. In his introduction (p. xx.) to the Syrian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Proverbes et
Dictons</span></i> Doctor Count Landberg was pleased to criticise, with less than
<span class="pageno" id="Page_417">417</span>his usual knowledge, my study entitled “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proverbia Communia Syriaca</span>”
(Unexplored Syria i. 264–294). These 187 “dictes” were taken mainly
from a MS. collection by one Hanná Misk, ex-dragoman of the British Consulate,
(Damascus), a little recueil for private use such as would be made by a
Syro-Christian <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bourgeois</span></i>. Hereupon the critic absurdly asserted that the
translator <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">a voulu s’occuper de la langue classique au lieu de se faire * * *
l’interprète fidèle de celle du peuple</span></i>. My reply was (The Nights, vol. viii.
148) that, as I was treating of proverbs familiar to the better educated order
of citizens, his critique was not to the point; and this brought down upon
me the following letter under the ægis of a portentous coronet and
initials blazing with or, gules and azure.</p>

<p class="c000">After these preliminaries I proceed to notice the article (No. 335, of July
’86) in</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite>THE “EDINBURGH REVIEW,”</cite></h3>
<p class="c036">and to explain its private history with the motives which begat it.</p>

<p class="c000">“This is the Augustan age of English criticism,” say the reviewers
who are fond of remarking that the period is one of literary appreciation
rather than of original production; that is, contemporary reviewers, critics
and monograph-writers are more important than “makers” in verse or in
prose. In fact it is their <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">aurea ætas</span></i>. I reply “Virgin ore, no!” on the
whole mixed metal some noble, much ignoble; a little gold, more silver and
an abundance of brass, lead and dross. There is the criticism of Sainte-Beuve,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_418">418</span>of the late Matthew Arnold and of Swinburne; there is also the
criticism of the <cite>Saturday Reviler</cite> and of the <cite>Edinburgh criticaster</cite>. The
golden is truth and honour incarnate: it possesses outsight and insight:
it either teaches and inspires or it comforts and consoles, save when a
strict sense of duty compels it to severity: briefly, it is keen and guiding
and creative. Let the young beginner learn by rote what one master
says of another:—“He was never provoked into coarseness: his thrusts
were made with the rapier according to the received rules of fence; he
firmly upheld the honour of his calling and in the exercise of it was
uniformly fearless, independent and incorrupt.” The Brazen is partial,
one-sided, tricksy, misleading, immoral; serving personal and interested
purposes and contemptuously forgetful of every obligation which an
honest and honourable pen owes to the public and to itself. Such
critiques bring no profit to the reviewed. He feels that he has been
written up or written down by a literary hireling who has possibly been
paid to praise or abuse him secondarily, and primarily to exalt or debase
his publisher or his printer.</p>

<p class="c000">My own literary career has supplied me with many a curious study.
Writing upon subjects, say The Lake Regions of Central Africa, which
were then a type of the Unknown, I could readily trace in the journalistic
notices all the tricks and dodges of the trade. The rare honest would
confess that they could say nothing upon the subject; they came to me
therefore for information and professed themselves duly thankful. The
many dishonest had recourse to a variety of devices. The hard worker
would read-up voyages and travels treating of the neighbouring countries,
Abyssinia, the Cape and the African Coasts, Eastern and Western; thus
he would write in a kind of reflected light without acknowledging his
obligation to my volumes. Another would review my book after the
easy American fashion of hashing up the author’s production, taking all
its facts from me without disclosing that one fact to the reader and then
proceed to “butter” or “slash.” The worst, “fulfyld with malace of
froward entente,” would choose for theme not the work but the worker,
upon the good old principle “Abuse the plaintiffs attorney.” These arts
fully account for the downfall of criticism in our day and the deafness of
the public to such literary verdicts. But a few years ago a favourable
review in a first-rate paper was “fifty pounds in the author’s pocket:”
now it is not worth as many pence unless signed by some well-known
scribbling statesman or bustling reverend who caters for the public taste.
The decline and fall is well expressed in the old lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est sanctior quod laudaris:</span></div>
      <div class="line"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non est vilior si vituperaris.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">“No one, now-a-days cares for reviews,” wrote Darwin as far back as
1840; and it is easy to see the whys and the wherefores. I have already
<span class="pageno" id="Page_419">419</span>touched upon the duty of reviewing the reviewer when the latter’s work
calls for the process, despite the pretensions of modern criticism that it
must not be criticised. Although to buffet an anonym is to beat the air
still the very effort does good. A well-known and popular novelist of the
present day was a favourite butt for certain journalists who, with the
normal half-knowledge of men—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“That read too little, and that write too much”—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">persistently fell foul of the points in which the author was almost always
right and the reviewer was wrong. “An eagle hawketh not at flies:” the
object of ill-natured satire despised——</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The creatures of the stall and stye,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">and persisted in contemptuous reticence, giving consent by silence to
what was easily refuted, and suffering a fond and foolish sentence to
misguide the public which it pretends to direct. “Take each man’s
censure but reserve thy judgment,” is a wise saying when silently practised;
it leads, however, to suffering in public esteem. The case in question
was wholly changed when, at my suggestion, the writer was persuaded to
catch a few of the culprits and to administer the dressing and redressing
they so richly deserved.</p>

<p class="c000">And now to my tale.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Henry Reeve, Editor of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>, wrote to me
shortly before my first volume was issued to subscribers (September, ’85)
asking for advance sheets, as his magazine proposed to produce a general
notice of The Arabian Nights Entertainments. But I suspected the man
whose indiscretion and recklessness had been so unpleasantly paraded in
the shape of the Greville (Mr. Worldly Wiseman’s) Memoirs, and I had
not forgotten the untruthful and malignant articles of perfervid brutality
which during the hot youth and calm middle age of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> had
disgraced the profession of letters. My answer, which was temporising and
diplomatic, induced only a second and a more urgent application. Bearing
in mind that professional etiquette hardly justifies publicly reviewing a book
intended only for private reading and vividly remembering the evil record
of the periodical, I replied that the sheets should be forwarded but on
one condition; namely, that the reviewer would not dwell too lovingly
and longingly upon the “archaics,” which had so excited the Tartuffean
temperament of the chaste <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite>. Mr. Henry Reeves replied
(surlily) that he was not in the habit of dictating to his staff and I rejoined
by refusing to grant his request. So he waited until five, that is one-half
of my volumes had been distributed to subscribers, and revenged himself
by placing them for review in the hands of the “Lane-Poole” clique
<span class="pageno" id="Page_420">420</span>which, as the sequel proved could be noisy and combative as setting hens
disturbed when their nest-egg was threatened by an intruding hand.</p>

<p class="c000">For the clique had appropriated all right and claim to a monopoly of
The Arabian Nights Entertainments which they held in hand as a rotten
borough. The “Uncle and Master,” Mr. Edward William Lane, eponymous
hero of the house, had re-translated certain choice specimens of the
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Recueil</span></cite> and the “nephews of their uncle” resolved to make a private
gold-mine thereof. The book came out in monthly parts at half-a-crown
(1839–41), and when offered for sale in 3 vols. royal 8vo, the edition of
5,000 hung fire at first until the high price (£3. 3s.) was reduced to
27 shillings for the trade. The sale then went off briskly and amply
repaid the author and the publishers—Charles Knight and Co. And
although here and there some “old Tory” grumbled that new-fangled
words (as Wezeer, Kádee and Jinnee) had taken the places of his childhood’s
pets, the Vizier, the Cadi, and the Genie, none complained of the
workmanship for the all-sufficient reason that naught better was then
known or could be wanted. Its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">succès de salon</span></i> was greatly indebted
to the “many hundred engravings on wood, from original designs by
William Harvey”; with a host of quaint and curious Arabesques, Cufic
inscriptions, vignettes, head-pieces and <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">culs-de-lampes</span></i>. These, with the
exception of sundry minor accessories,<a id="r448"></a><a href="#f448" class="c011"><sup>[448]</sup></a> were excellent and showed for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_421">421</span>the first time the realistic East and not the absurdities drawn from the
depths of artistical ignorance and self-consciousness—those of Smirke,
Deveria, Chasselot and Co., not to speak of the horrors of the De Sacy
edition, whose plates have apparently been used by Prof. Weil and by the
Italian versions. And so the three bulky and handsome volumes found a
ready way into many a drawing-room during the Forties, when the public
was uncritical enough to hail the appearance of these scattered chapters
and to hold that at last they had the real thing, pure and unadulterated.
No less than three reprints of the “Standard Edition,” 1859 (the last
being in ’83) succeeded one another and the issue was finally stopped,
not by the author’s death (ætat 75; London, August 10, 1876: nat.
Hereford, September 17, 1801), nor by the plates, which are now the
property of Messieurs Chatto and Windus, becoming too worn for use,
but simply by deficient demand. And the clique, represented by the late
Edward Lane-Poole in 1879, who edited the last edition (1883) with a
Preface by Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, during a long run of forty-three years
never paid the public the compliment of correcting the multitudinous
errors and short-comings of the translation. Even the lengthy and
longsome notes, into which The Nights have too often been merged,
were left untrimmed. Valuable in themselves and full of information,
while wholly misplaced in a recueil of folk-lore, where they stand like
pegs behung with the contents of the translator’s adversaria, the monographs
on details of Arab life have also been exploited and reprinted under the
“fatuous” title, “Arabian (for Egyptian) Society in the Middle Ages:
<span class="pageno" id="Page_422">422</span>Studies on The Thousand and One Nights.” They were edited by
Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole (Chatto and Windus) in 1883.</p>

<p class="c000">At length the three volumes fell out of date, and the work was formally
pronounced unreadable. Goëthe, followed from afar by Emerson, had
foreseen the “inevitable increase of Oriental influence upon the
Occident,” and the eagerness with which the men of the West would apply
themselves to the languages and literature of the East. Such garbled and
mutilated, unsexed and unsouled versions and perversions like Lane’s
were felt to be survivals of the unfittest. Mr. John Payne (for whom see
my Foreword, vol. i. pp. xii.–xiii.) resolved to give the world the first
honest and complete version of the Thousand Nights and a Night. He
put forth samples of his work in the <cite>New Quarterly Magazine</cite> (January-April,
1879), whereupon he was incontinently assaulted by Mr. Reginald
Stuart Poole, the then front of the monopolists, who after drawing up a
list of fifteen errata (which were not errata) in two Nights, declared that
“they must be multiplied five hundred-fold to give the sum we may
expect.” (The <cite>Academy</cite>, April 26, 1879; November 29, 1881; and
December 7, 1881.) The critic had the courage, or rather impudence, to
fall foul of Mr. Payne’s mode and mannerism, which had long become
deservedly famous, and concludes:—“The question of English style may
for the present be dropped, as, if a translator cannot translate, it little
matters in what form his results appear. <em>But it may be questioned whether
an Arab edifice should be decorated with old English wall-papers.</em>”</p>

<p class="c000">Evidently I had scant reason to expect mercy from the clique: I
wanted none and I received none.</p>

<p class="c000">My reply to the arch-impostor, who</p>

<p class="c000">will perforce be somewhat detailed: it is necessary to answer paragraph
by paragraph, and the greater part of the thirty-three pages refers more or
less directly to myself. To begin with the beginning, it caused me and
many others some surprise to see the “Thousand Nights and a Night”
expelled the initial list of thirteen items, as if it were held unfit for
mention. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cet article est principalement une diatribe contre l’ouvrage de
Sir Richard Burton, et dans le libre cet ouvrage n’est même pas mentionné</span></i>,
writes my French friend. This proceeding was a fair specimen of “that
impartiality which every reviewer is supposed to possess.” But the
ignoble “little dodge” presently suggested itself. The preliminary
excursus (p. 168) concerning the “Mille et Une Nuits (read Nuit) an
audacious fraud, though not the less the best story book in the world,”
affords us a useful measure of the writer’s competence in the matter of
audacity and ill-judgment. The honest and single-minded Galland is
here (let us believe through that pure ignorance which haply may hope for
“fool’s pardon”) grossly and unjustly vilified; and, by way of making
<span class="pageno" id="Page_423">423</span>bad worse, we are assured (p. 167) that the Frenchman “brought the
Arabic manuscript from Syria”—an unfact which is surprising to the most
superficial student. “Galland was a born story-teller, in the good and
the bad sense” (p. 167) is a silly sneer of the true Lane-Poolean
type. The critic then compares most unadvisedly (p. 168) a passage
in Galland (De Sacy edit. vol. i. 414) with the same in Mr. Payne’s
(i. 260) by way of proving the “extraordinary liberties which the worthy
Frenchman permitted himself to take with the Arabic”: had he troubled
himself to collate my version (i. 290–291), which is made fuller by the
Breslau Edit. (ii. 190), he would have found that the Frenchman, as
was his wont, abridged rather than amplified;<a id="r449"></a><a href="#f449" class="c011"><sup>[449]</sup></a> although, when the
original permitted exact translation, he could be literal enough. And
what doubt, may I enquire, can we have concerning “The Sleeper
Awakened” (Lane, ii. 351–376), or, as I call it, “The Sleeper and the
Waker” (Suppl. vol. i. 1–39), when it occurs in a host of MSS., not to
mention the collection of tales which Prof. Habicht converted into the
Arabian Nights by breaking the text into a thousand and one sections
(Bresl. Edit. iv. 134–189, Nights cclxxii.–ccxci.). The reckless assertions
that “the whole of the last fourteen (Gallandian) tales have nothing
whatever to do with ‘The Nights’” (p. 168); and that of the histories of
Zayn al-Asnám and Aladdin, “it is abundantly certain that they belong to
no manuscript of the Thousand and One Nights” (p. 169), have been
notably stultified by M. Hermann Zotenberg’s purchase of two volumes
containing both these bones of long and vain contention. See Foreword
to my Suppl. vol. iii. pp. viii.–xi., and Mr. W. F. Kirby’s interesting notice
of M. Zotenberg’s epoch-making booklet (vol. vi. p. 35).</p>

<p class="c000">“The first English edition was published (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">pace</span></i> Lowndes) within eight
years of Galland’s” (p. 170) states a mere error. The second part of Galland
(6 vols. 12mo) was not issued till 1717, or two years after the translator’s
death. Of the English editio princeps the critic tells nothing, nor indeed
has anyone as yet been able to tell us aught. Of the dishonouring
assertion (again let us hope made in simple ignorance) concerning
“Cazotte’s barefaced forgery” (p. 170), thus slandering the memory of
Jacques Cazotte, one of the most upright and virtuous of men who ever
graced the ranks of literature, I have disposed in the Foreword to my
Supplemental vol. vi. “This edition (Scott’s) was tastefully reprinted
by Messrs. Nimmo and Bain in four volumes in 1883” (p. 170).
But why is the reader not warned that the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eaux fortes</span></i> are by Lalauze
(see suprà, p. 408), 19 in number, and taken from the 21 illustrations in
MM. Jouaust’s edit. of Galland with preface by J. Janin? Why also did
the critic not inform us that Scott’s sixth volume, the only original part of
the work, was wilfully omitted? This paragraph ends with mentioning
<span class="pageno" id="Page_424">424</span>the labours of Baron von Hammer-Purgstall, concerning whom we are
afterwards told (p. 186) for the first time that he “was brilliant and
laborious.” Hard-working, yes! brilliant, by no means!</p>

<p class="c000">We now come to the glorification of the “Uncle and Master,” concerning
whom I can only say that Lane’s bitterest enemy (if the amiable
Orientalist ever had any unfriend) could not have done him more discredit
than this foolish friend. “His classical (!) translation was at once
recognised as an altogether new departure,” (p. 171) and “it was written
in such a manner that the Oriental tone of The Nights should be reflected
in the English.” (ibid.) “It aims at reproducing in some degree the literary
flavour of the original” (p. 173). “The style of Lane’s translation is an
old-fashioned somewhat Biblical language” (p. 173), and “it is precisely
this antiquated ring” (of the imperfect and mutilated “Boulak edition,”
unwisely preferred by the translator) “that Lane has succeeded in preserving.”
“The measured and finished language Lane chose for his
version is eminently fitted to represent the rhythmical tongue of the Arab”
(Memoir, p. xxvii). “The translation itself is distinguished by its singular
accuracy and by the marvellous way in which the Oriental tone and colour
are retained” (ibid). The writer has taken scant trouble to read me when
he asserts that the Bulak edit. was my text, and I may refer him for his
own advantage, to my Foreword (vol. i. p. xix), which he has wilfully ignored
by stating unfact. I hasten to plead guilty before the charge of “really
misunderstanding the design of Lane’s style” (p. 173). Much must be
pardoned to the panegyrist, the encomiast; but the idea of mentioning
in the same sentence with Biblical English, the noblest and most perfect
specimen of our prose, the stiff and bald, the vapid and turgid manner of the
Orientalist who “commences” and “concludes”—never begins and ends;
who never uses a short word if he can find a long word, who systematically
rejects terse and idiomatic Anglo-Saxon when a Latinism is to be employed
and whose pompous stilted periods are the very triumph of the “Deadly-lively”!
By arts precisely similar the learned George Sale made the
Koran, that pure and unstudied inspiration of Arabian eloquence, dull
as a law document, and left the field clear for the Rev. Mr. Rodwell. I
attempted to excuse the style-laches of Lane by noticing the lack
of study in English linguistic which distinguished the latter part of
the xviiith and the first half of the xixth centuries, when men disdaining
the grammar of their own tongue, learned it from Latin and Greek;
when not a few styled Shakespeare “silly-billy,” and when Lamb, the
essayist, wrote, “I can read, and I say it seriously, the homely old
version of the Psalms for an hour or two together sometimes, without
sense of weariness.” But the reviewer will have none of my palliative
process, he is surprised at my “posing as a judge of prose style,” being
“acquainted with my quaint perversions of the English language” (p. 173)
and, when combating my sweeping assertion that “our prose” (especially
<span class="pageno" id="Page_425">425</span>the prose of schoolmasters and professors, of savans and Orientalists) “was
perhaps the worst in Europe,” he triumphantly quotes half a dozen great
exceptions whose eminence goes far to prove the rule.</p>

<p class="c000">As regards Lane’s unjustifiable excisions the candid writer tells us
everything but the truth. As I have before noted (vol. ix. 304), the main
reason was simply that the publisher, who was by no means a business man,
found the work outgrowing his limits and insisted upon its coming to an
untimely and, alas! a tailless end. This is perhaps the principal cause for
ignoring the longer histories, like King Omar bin al-Nu’umán (occupying
371 pages in my vols. ii. and iii.); Abú Hasan and his slave-girl Tawaddud
(pp. 56, vol. v. 189–245); the Queen of the Serpents with the episodes of
Bulukiyá, and of Jánshah (pp. 98 vol. v. 298–396); The Rogueries of Dalilah
the Crafty and the Adventures of Mercury Ali (pp. 55 vol. vii. 144–209).
The Tale of Harun al-Rashid and Abu Hasan of Oman (pp. 19, vol. ix.
188–207) is certainly not omitted by dictations of delicacy, nor is it true of
the parts omitted in general that “none could be purified without being
destroyed.” As my French friend remarks, “Few parts are so plain-spoken
as the introduction, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le cadre de l’ouvrage</span></i>, yet M. Lane was not deterred by
such situation.” And lastly we have, amongst the uncalled-for excisions,
King Jali’ad of Hind, etc. (pp. 102, vol. ix. 32–134). The sum represents
a grand total of 701 pages, while not a few of the notes are filled with
unimportant fabliaux and apologues.</p>

<p class="c000">But the critic has been grandly deceptive, either designedly or of ignorance
prepense, in his arithmetic. “There are <em>over four hundred</em> of these
(anecdotes, fables, and stories) in the complete text, and Lane <em>has not
translated more than two hundred</em>” (p. 172). * * * “Adding the
omitted anecdotes to the omitted tales, it appears that Lane left out about
a third of the whole ‘Nights,’ and of that third at least three-fourths was
incompatible with a popular edition. When Mr. Payne and Captain
Burton boast of presenting the public ‘with three times as much matter
as any other version,’ they perhaps mean a third as much again” (p. 173). * * * “Captain Burton records his opinion that Lane has omitted
half and by far the more characteristic half of the Arabian Nights, but
Captain Burton has a talent for exaggeration, and for ‘characteristic’
we should read ‘unclean.’ It is natural that he should make the most of
such omissions, since they form the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> of his own translation; but
he has widely overshot the mark, and the public may rest assured that the
tales omitted from the standard version (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">proh pudor!</span>) are of very slight
importance in comparison with the tales included in it” (p. 173).</p>

<p class="c000">What a mass of false statement!</p>

<p class="c000">Let us now exchange fiction for fact. Lane’s three volumes contain a
total, deducting 15 for index, of pp. 1995 (viz. 618 + 643 + 734); while each
(full) page of text averages 38 lines and of notes (in smaller type) 48.
The text with a number of illustrations represents a total of pp. 1485
<span class="pageno" id="Page_426">426</span>(viz. 441 + 449 + 595). Mr. Payne’s nine volumes contain a sum of pp. 3057,
mostly without breaks, to the 1485 of the “Standard edition.” In my
version the sum of pages, each numbering 41 lines, is 3156, or 1163 more
than Lane’s total and 2671 more than his text.</p>

<p class="c000">Again, in Lane’s text the tales number 62 (viz. 35 + 14 + 13) and as has
been stated all the longest have been omitted, save only Sindbad the Seaman.
The anecdotes in the notes amount to 44½ (viz. 3½ + 35 + 6): these are
for the most part the merest outlines and include the 3½ of volume i. viz. the
Tale of Ibrahim al-Mausilí (pp. 223–24), the Tale of Caliph Mu’áwiyah
(i. pp. 521–22), the Tale of Mukhárik the Musician (i. pp. 224–26), and the
half tale of Umm ’Amr (i. p. 522). They are quoted bodily from the
“Halbat al-Kumayt” and from “the Kitáb al-Unwán fí Makáid
al-Niswán,” showing that at the early stage of his labours the translator,
who published in parts, had not read the book on which he was working;
or, at least, had not learned that all the three and a half had been borrowed
from The Nights. Thus the grand total is represented by 106½ tales, and
the reader will note the difference between 106½ and the diligent and
accurate reviewer’s “not much more than two hundred.” In my version the
primary tales amount to 171; the secondaries, &amp;c., to 96 and the total to
267, while Mr. Payne has 266.<a id="r450"></a><a href="#f450" class="c011"><sup>[450]</sup></a> And these the critic swells to “over four
hundred!” Thus I have more than double the number of pages in Lane’s
text (allowing the difference between his 38 lines to an oft-broken page
and my 41) and nearly two and a-half tales to his one, and therefore I do
<em>not</em> mean “a third as much again.”</p>

<p class="c000">Thus, too, we can deal with the dishonest assertions concerning Lane’s
translation “not being absolutely complete” (p. 171) and that “nobody
desired to see the objectionable passages which constituted the bulk of
Lane’s omissions restored to their place in the text” (p. 175).</p>

<p class="c000">The critic now passes to The Uncle’s competence for the task, which
he grossly exaggerates. Mr. Lane had no “intimate acquaintance with
Mahommedan life” (p. 174). His “Manners and Customs of the Modern
Egyptians” should have been entitled “Modern Cairenes;” he had seen
nothing of Nile-land save what was shown to him by a trip to Philæ in his
first visit (1825–28) and another to Thebes during his second; he was
profoundly ignorant of Egypt as a whole, and even in Cairo he knew
nothing of woman-life and child-life—two thirds of humanity. I doubt if
he could have understood the simplest expression in baby language; not
to mention the many idioms peculiar to the Harem-nursery. The
characteristic of his work is geniality combined with a true affection for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_427">427</span>his subject, but no scholar can ignore its painful superficiality. His studies
of legal theology gave him much weight with the Olema, although, at the
time when he translated The Nights, his knowledge of Arabic was
small. Hence the number of lapses which disfigures his pages. These
would have been excusable in an Orientalist working out of Egypt; but
Lane had a Shaykh ever at his elbow and he was always able to command
the assistance of the University Mosque, Al-Azhar. I need not enter upon
the invidious task of cataloguing these errors, especially as the most
glaring have been cursorily noticed in my volumes. Mr. Lane after
leaving Egypt became one of the best Arabic scholars of his day, but his
fortune did not equal his deserts. The Lexicon is a fine work although
sadly deficient in the critical sense, but after the labour of thirty-four years (it
began printing in 1863) it reached only the 19th letter Ghayn (p. 2386).
Then invidious Fate threw it into the hands of Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole.
With characteristic audacity he disdained to seek the services of some
German Professor, an order of men which, rarely dining out and caring
little for “Society,” can devote itself entirely to letters; perhaps he
hearkened to the silly charge against the Teuton of minuteness and
futility of research as opposed to “good old English breadth and
suggestiveness of treatment.” And the consequence has been a “continuation”
which serves as a standard whereby to measure the excellence
of the original work and the woful falling-off and deficiencies of the sequel—the
latter retaining of the former naught save the covers.<a id="r451"></a><a href="#f451" class="c011"><sup>[451]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_428">428</span>Of Mr. Lane’s Notes I have ever spoken highly: they are excellent and
marvellously misplaced—<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">non erat his locus</span></i>. The text of a story-book is too
frail to bear so ponderous a burden of classical Arabian lore, and the
annotations injure the symmetry of the book as a work of art. They
begin with excessive prolixity: in the Introduction these studies fill
27 closely printed pages to 14 of a text broken by cuts and vignettes.
In chapt. i. the proportion is pp. 20, notes: 15 text; and in chapt. ii. it is
pp. 20: 35. Then they become, under the publisher’s protest, beautifully
<span class="pageno" id="Page_429">429</span>less; and in vol. iii. chapt. 30 (the last) they are pp. 5: 57. Long
disquisitions, “On the initial Moslem formula,” “On the Wickedness of
Women,” “On Fate and Destiny,” “On Arabian Cosmogony,” “On
Slaves,” “On Magic,” “On the Two Grand Festivals,” all these being
appended to the Introduction and the first chapter, are mere <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’œuvres</span></i>:
such “copy” should have been reserved for another edition of “The
Modern Egyptians.” The substitution of chapters for Nights was perverse
and ill-judged as it could be; but it appears venial compared with
condensing the tales in a commentary, thus converting the Arabian Nights
into Arabian Notes. However, “Arabian Society in the Middle Ages,” a
legacy left by the “Uncle and Master”; and, like the tame and inadequate
“Selections from the Koran,” utilised by the grand-nephew, has been of
service to the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>. Also, as it appears three several and distinct
times in one article (pp. 166, 174, and 183), we cannot but surmise that
a main object of the critique was to advertise the volume. Men are crafty
in these days when practising the “puff indirect.”</p>

<p class="c000">But the just complaint against Lane’s work is its sin of omission. The
partial Reviewer declares (pp. 174–75) that the Arabist “re-translated The
Nights in a practical spirit, omitting what was objectionable, together with
a few tales (!) that were, on the whole, uninteresting or tautological, and
enriching the work with a multitude of valuable notes. We had now a
scholarly version of the greater part of The Nights imbued with the spirit
of the East and rich in illustrative comment; and for forty years no one
thought of anything more, although Galland still kept his hold on the
nursery.” Despite this spurious apology, the critic is compelled cautiously
to confess (p. 172), “We are not sure that some of these omissions were
not mistaken;” and he instances “Abdallah the Son of Fazil” and
“Abu ’l-Hasan of Khorasan” (he means, I suppose, Abu Hasan al-Ziyádi
and the Khorasani Man (iv. 285),) whilst he suggests, “a careful
abridgment of the tale of Omar the Son of No’man” (ii. 77, etc.) Let
me add that wittiest and most rollicking of Rabelaisian skits, “Ali the
Persian and the Kurd Sharper” (iv. 149), struck-out in the very wantonness
of “respectability;” and the classical series, an Arabian “Pilpay,” entitled
“King Jali’ád of Hind and his Wazir Shimas” (iv. 32). Nor must I omit
to notice the failure most injurious to the work which destroyed in it half
the “spirit of the East.” Mr. Lane had no gift of verse or rhyme: he
must have known that the ten thousand lines of the original Nights formed
a striking and necessary contrast with the narrative part, acting as <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it" xml:lang="it">aria</span></i> to
<i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it" xml:lang="it">recitativo</span></i>. Yet he rendered them only in the baldest and most prosaic
of English without even the balanced style of the French translations. He
can be excused only for one consideration—bad prose is not so bad as
bad verse.</p>

<p class="c000">The ill-judged over-appreciation and glorification of Mr. Lane is
followed (p. 176), by the depreciation and bedevilment of Mr. John
<span class="pageno" id="Page_430">430</span>Payne, who first taught the world what The Nights really is. We are told
that the author (like myself) “unfortunately did not know Arabic;” and
we are not told that he is a sound Persian scholar: however, “he undoubtedly
managed to pick up enough of the language (!) to understand
The Arabian Nights with the assistance of the earlier translations of (by?)
Torrens and Lane,” the former having printed only one volume out of
some fifteen. This critic thinks proper now to ignore the “old English
wall-papers,” of Mr. R. S. Poole, indeed he concedes to the translator of
Villon, a “genius for language,” a “singular robust and masculine prose,
which for the present purpose he intentionally weighted with archaisms
and obsolete words but without greatly injuring its force or brilliancy”
(p. 177). With plausible candour he also owns that the version “is a
fine piece of English; it is also, save where the exigencies of rhyme compelled
a degree of looseness, remarkably literal” (p. 178). Thus the
author is damned with faint praise by one who utterly fails to appreciate the
portentous difference between linguistic genius and linguistic mediocrity,
and the Reviewer proceeds, “a careful collation” (we have already heard
what his “careful” means) “of the different versions with their originals
leads us to the conclusion that Mr. Payne’s version is <em>little less faithful
than Lane’s</em> in those parts which are common to both, and is practically
as close a rendering as is desirable” (p. 178). Tell the truth, man, and
shame the Devil! I assert and am ready to support that the “Villon
version” is incomparably superior to Lane’s not only in its simple, pure
and forcible English, but also in its literal and absolute correctness, being
almost wholly free from the blunders and inaccuracies which everywhere
disfigure Torrens, and which are rarely absent from Lane. I also repeat
that wherever the style and the subject are the most difficult to treat,
Mr. Payne comes forth most successfully from the contest, thus giving
the best proof of his genius and capacity for painstaking. Of the metrical
part which makes the Villon version as superior to Lane’s as virgin gold
to German silver, the critique offers only three inadequate specimens
specially chosen and accompanied with a growl that “the verse is nothing
remarkable” (p. 177) and that the author is sometimes “led into extreme
liberties with the original” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i>). Not a word of praise for mastering
the prodigious difficulties of the monorhyme!</p>

<p class="c000">But—and there is a remarkable power in this particle—Mr. Payne’s
work is “restricted to the few wealthy collectors of proscribed books and
what booksellers’ catalogues describe as ‘facetiæ’” (p. 179); for “when
an Arabic word is unknown to the literary language” (what utter
imbecility!), and “belongs only to the low vocabulary of the gutter” (which
the most “elegant” writers most freely employ) “Mr. Payne laboriously
searches out a corresponding term in English ‘Billingsgate,’ and prides
himself upon an accurate reproduction of the tone of the original”
(p. 178). This is a remarkable twisting of the truth. Mr. Payne persisted,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_431">431</span>despite my frequent protests, in rendering the “nursery words”
and the “terms too plainly expressing natural situations” by old English
such as “kaze” and “swive,” equally ignored by the “gutter” and by
“Billingsgate”: he also omitted an offensive line whenever it did not
occur in all the texts and could honestly be left untranslated. But the
unfact is stated for a purpose: here the Reviewer mounts the high horse
and poses as the Magister Morum <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">per excellentiam</span></i>. The Battle of the
Books has often been fought, the crude text <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</span></i> the bowdlerised and
the expurgated; and our critic can contribute to the great fray only the
merest platitudes. “There is an old and trusty saying that ‘evil communications
corrupt good manners,’ and it is a well-known fact that the
discussion (?) and reading of depraved literature leads (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) infallibly to the
depravation of the reader’s mind” (p. 179).<a id="r452"></a><a href="#f452" class="c011"><sup>[452]</sup></a> I should say that the
childish indecencies and the unnatural vice of the original cannot deprave
any mind save that which is perfectly prepared to be depraved; the
former would provoke only curiosity and amusement to see bearded men
such mere babes, and the latter would breed infinitely more disgust than
desire. The man must be prurient and lecherous as a dog-faced baboon
in rut to have aught of passion excited by either. And most inept is the
conclusion, “So long as Mr. Payne’s translation remains defiled by words,
sentences, and whole paragraphs descriptive of coarse and often horribly
depraved sensuality, it can never stand beside Lane’s, which still remains
the standard version of the Arabian Nights” (p. 179.) <i><span lang="it" xml:lang="it" xml:lang="it">Altro!</span></i> No one
knows better than the clique that Lane, after an artificially prolonged life
of some half-century, has at last been weighed in the balance and been
found wanting; that he is dying that second death which awaits the
unsatisfactory worker and that his Arabian Nights are consigned by the
present generation to the limbo of things obsolete and forgotten.</p>

<p class="c000">But if Mr. Payne is damned with poor praise and mock modesty, my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_432">432</span>version is condemned without redemption—beyond all hope of salvation:
there is not a word in favour of a work which has been received by the
reviewers with a chorus of kindly commendation. “The critical battery
opens with a round-shot.” “Another complete translation is now appearing
in a surreptitious way” (p. 179). How “surreptitious” I ask of
this scribe, who ekes not the lack of reason by a superfluity of railing,
when I sent out some 24,000–30,000 advertisements and published my
project in the literary papers? “The amiability of the two translators
(Payne and Burton) was testified by their each dedicating a volume to the
other. So far as the authors are concerned nothing could be more
harmonious and delightful; but the public naturally ask, What do we want
with two forbidden versions?” And I again inquire, What can be done
by me to satisfy this atrabilious and ill-conditioned Aristarchus? Had
I not mentioned Mr. Payne, my silence would have been construed
into envy, hatred and malice: if I am proud to acknowledge my friend’s
noble work the proceeding engenders a spiteful sneer. As regards the
“want,” public demand is easily proved. It is universally known
(except to the Reviewer who will not know) that Mr. Payne, who printed
only 500 copies, was compelled to refuse as many hundreds of would-be
subscribers; and, when my design was made public by the Press, these
and others at once applied to me. “To issue a thousand still more
objectionable copies by another and not a better hand” (notice the quip
cursive!) may “seem preposterous” (p. 180), but only to a writer so
“preposterous” as this.</p>

<p class="c000">“A careful (again!) examination of Captain Burton’s translation shows
that he has not, as he pretends (!), corrected it to agree with the Calcutta
text, but has made a hotchpotch of various texts, choosing one or another—Cairo,
Breslau, Macnaghten or first Calcutta—according as it presented
most of the ‘characteristic’ detail (note the dig i’ the side vicious), in
which Captain Burton’s version is peculiarly strong” (p. 180). So in
return for the severe labour of collating the four printed texts and of
supplying the palpable omissions, which by turns disfigure each and every
of the quartette, thus producing a complete copy of the Recueil, I gain
nothing but blame. My French friend writes to me: <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Lorsqu’il s’agit d’établir
un texte d’après différents manuscrits, il est certain qu’il faut prendre pour
base une-seule redaction. Mais il n’est pas de même d’une traduction. Il est
conforme aux règles de la saine critique littéraire, de suivre tous les textes.</span></i>
Lane, I repeat, contented himself with the imperfect Bulak text while
Payne and I preferred the Macnaghten Edition which, says the Reviewer,
with a futile falsehood all his own, is “really only a revised form of the
Cairo text”<a id="r453"></a><a href="#f453" class="c011"><sup>[453]</sup></a> (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i>). He concludes, making me his rival in ignorance,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_433">433</span>that I am unacquainted with the history of the MS. from which the four-volume
Calcutta Edition was printed (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i>). I should indeed be thankful to
him if he could inform me of its ultimate fate: it has been traced by me
to the Messieurs Allen and I have vainly consulted Mr. Johnston who
carries on the business under the name of that now defunct house. The
MS. has clean disappeared.</p>

<p class="c000">“On the other hand he (Captain Burton) sometimes omits passages
which he considers (!) tautological and thereby deprives his version of
the merit of completeness (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> vol. v. p. 327). It is needless to remark
that this uncertainty about the text destroys the scholarly value of the
translation” (p. 180). The scribe characteristically forgets to add that I
have invariably noted these excised passages which are always the merest
repetitions, damnable iterations of a twice-, and sometimes a thrice-told
tale, and that I so act upon the great principle—in translating a work of
imagination and “inducing” an Oriental tale, the writer’s first duty to his
readers is making his pages readable.</p>

<p class="c000">“Captain Burton’s version is sometimes rather loose” (p. 180), says the
critic who quotes five specimens out of five volumes and who might have
quoted five hundred. This is another favourite “dodge” with the rogue-reviewer,
who delights to cite words and phrases and texts detached from
their contexts. A translator is often compelled, by way of avoiding
recurrences which no English public could endure, to render a word, whose
literal and satisfactory meaning he has already given, by a synonym or a
homonym in no way so sufficient or so satisfactory. He charges me with
rendering “<em>Siyar</em>, which means ‘doings,’ by ‘works and words’”; little
knowing that the veteran Orientalist, M. Joseph Derenbourgh (p. 98,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Johannes de Capua, Directorium</span></i>, etc.,) renders “Akhlák-í wa Síratí”
(sing. of Siyar) by <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">caractère et conduite</span></i>, the latter consisting of deeds and
speech. He objects to “Kabir” (lit. = old) being turned into <em>very</em> old;
yet this would be its true sense were the Ráwí or story-teller to lay stress
and emphasis upon the word, as here I suppose him to have done. But
what does the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> know of the Ráwí? Again I render
“Mal’únah” (not the mangled Mal’ouna) lit. = accurst, as “damned
whore,” which I am justified in doing when the version is of the category
Call-a-spade-a-spade.</p>

<p class="c000">“Captain Burton’s Arabian Nights, however, has another defect
besides this textual inaccuracy” (p. 180); and this leads to a whole page
of abusive rhetoric anent my vocabulary: the Reviewer has collected
some thirty specimens—he might have collected three hundred from the
five volumes—and he concludes that the list places Captain Burton’s
version “quite out of the category of English books” (p. 181) and
“extremely annoying to any reader with a feeling for style.” Much he
must know of modern literary taste which encourages the translator of
an ancient work such as Mr. Gibb’s Aucassin and Nicholete (I quote
<span class="pageno" id="Page_434">434</span>but one in a dozen) to borrow the charm of antiquity by imitating the
nervous and expressive language of the pre-Elizabethans and Shakespeareans.
Let him compare any single page of Mr. Payne with Messieurs
Torrens and Lane and he will find that the difference <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">saute aux yeux</span></i>.
But a purist who objects so forcibly to archaism and archaicism should
avoid such terms as “whilom Persian Secretary” (p. 170); as anthophobia,
which he is compelled to explain by “dread of selecting only what is
best” (p. 175); as anthophobist (p. 176); as “fatuous ejaculations”
(p. 183), as a “raconteurs” (p. 186), and as “intermedium” (p. 194) terms
which are certainly not understood by the general. And here we have a
list of six in thirty-three pages:—evidently this Reviewer did not expect
to be reviewed.</p>

<p class="c000">“Here is a specimen of his (Captain Burton’s) verse, in which, by the
way, there is seen another example of the careless manner in which the
proofs have been corrected” (p. 181). Generous and just to a work printed
from abroad and when absence prevented the author’s revision: false as
unfair to boot! And what does the critic himself but show two several
misprints in his 33 pages; “Mr. Payne, vol. ix. p. 274” (p. 168, for vol. i.
260), and “Jamshah” (p. 172, for Jánsháh). These faults may not
excuse my default: however, I can summon to my defence the <cite>Saturday
Review</cite>, that past-master in the art and mystery of carping criticism, which,
noticing my first two volumes (Jan. 2, 1886), declares them “laudably
free from misprints.”</p>

<p class="c000">“Captain Burton’s delight in straining the language beyond its capabilities
(?) finds a wide field when he comes to those passages in the
original which are written in rhyming prose” (p. 181). “Captain Burton
of course could not neglect such an opportunity for display of linguistic
flexibility on the model of ‘Peter Parley picked a peck of pickled
pepper’” (p. 182, where the Saj’a or prose rhyme is most ignorantly confounded
with our peculiarly English alliteration). But this is wilfully to
misstate the matter. Let me repeat my conviction (Terminal Essay, 163–164)
that The Nights, in its present condition, was intended as a text or
handbook for the Ráwí or professional story-teller, who would declaim the
recitative in quasi-conversational tones, would intone the Saj’a and would
chant the metrical portions to the twanging of the Rabábah or one-stringed
viol. The Reviewer declares that the original has many such
passages; but why does he not tell the reader that almost the whole
Koran, and indeed all classical Arab prose, is composed in such “jingle”?
“Doubtfully pleasing in the Arabic,” it may “sound the reverse of
melodious in our own tongue” (p. 282); yet no one finds fault with it
in the older English authors (Terminal Essay, p. 256), and all praised the
free use of it in Eastwick’s “Gulistán.” Torrens, Lane and Payne
deliberately rejected it, each for his own and several reason; Torrens
because he never dreamt of the application; Lane, because his scanty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_435">435</span>knowledge of English stood in his way; and Payne because he aimed at
a severely classical style, which could only lose grace, vigour and harmony
by such exotic decoration. In these matters every writer has an
undoubted right to carry out his own view, remembering the while that
it is impossible to please all tastes. I imitated the Saj’a, because I held
it to be an essential part of the work, and of my fifty reviewers none save
the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> considered the reproduction of the original manner aught
save a success. I care only to satisfy those whose judgment is satisfactory:
“the abuse and contempt of ignorant writers hurts me very
little” as Darwin says (iii. 88), and we all hold with Don Quixote that,
<i><span lang="es" xml:lang="es" xml:lang="es">es mejor ser loado de los pocos sabios, que burlado de los muchos necios</span></i>.</p>

<p class="c000">“This amusement (of reproducing the Saj’a) maybe carried to any
length (how?), and we do not see why Captain Burton neglects the metre
of the poetry, or divides his translation into sentences by stops, or permits
any break in the continuity of the narrative, since none such exists in the
Arabic” (p. 182). My reply is that I neglect the original metres first and
chiefly because I do not care to “caper in fetters,” as said Drummond
of Hawthornden; and, secondly, because many of them are unfamiliar
and consequently unpleasant to English ears. The exceptions are mostly
two, the Rajaz (Anapæsts and Iambs, Terminal Essay, x. 294), and the
Tawíl or long measure (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i> pp. 282, 296), which Mr. Lyall (Translations
of Ancient Arab. Poetry, p. xlix.) compares with “Abt Vogler,”</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And there! ye have heard and seen: consider and bow the head.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">This metre greatly outnumbers all others in The Nights; but its lilting
measure by no means suits every theme and in English it is apt to wax
monotonous.</p>

<p class="c000">“The following example of a literal rendering which Mr. Payne adduces
(vol. ix. 381: comp. my vol. v. 66) in order to show the difficulty of
turning the phraseology of the original into good English, should have
served Captain Burton as a model, and we are surprised he has not
adopted so charmingly cumbrous a style” (p. 102). I shall quote the
whole passage in question and shall show that by the most unimportant
changes, omissions and transpositions, without losing a word, the whole
becomes excellent English, and falls far behind the Reviewer’s style in
the contention for “cumbrousness”:—</p>

<p class="c012">“When morrowed the morning he bedabbled his feet with the water they twain
had expressed from the herb and, going-down to the sea, went thereupon walking days
and nights, he wondering the while at the horrors of the ocean and the marvels and
rarities thereof. And he ceased not faring over the face of the waters till he arrived at
an island as indeed it were Paradise. So Bulukiya went up thereto and fell to
wondering thereanent and at the beauties thereof; and he found it a great
island whose dust was saffron and its gravel were cornelian and precious stones: its
edges were gelsomine and the growth was the goodliest of the trees and the brightest of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_436">436</span>the scented herbs and the sweetest of them. Its rivulets were a-flowing; its brushwood
was of the Comorin aloe and the Sumatran lign-aloes; its reeds were sugar-canes and
round about it bloomed rose and narcissus and amaranth and gilliflower and chamomile
and lily and violet, all therein being of several kinds and different tints. The birds
warbled upon those trees and the whole island was fair of attributes and spacious of sides
and abundant of good things, comprising in fine all of beauty and loveliness,” etc.
(Payne, vol. ix. p. 381).</p>

<p class="c000">The Reviewer cites in his list, but evidently has not read, the “Tales
from the Arabic,” etc., printed as a sequel to The Nights, or he would
have known that Mr. Payne, for the second part of his work, deliberately
adopted a style literal as that above-quoted because it was the liveliest
copy of the original.</p>

<p class="c000">We now come to the crucial matter of my version, the annotative concerning
which this “decent gentleman,” as we suppose this critic would
entitle himself (p. 185) finds a fair channel of discharge for vituperative
rhetoric. But before entering upon this subject I must be allowed to
repeat a twice-told tale and once more to give the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</span></i> of my long
labour. When a friend asked me point-blank why I was bringing out my
translation so soon after another and a most scholarly version, my reply
was as follows:—“Sundry students of Orientalism assure me that they
are anxious to have the work in its crudest and most realistic form.
I have received letters saying, Let us know (you who can) what the Arab
of The Nights was: if good and high-minded let us see him: if witty and
humorous let us hear him: if coarse and uncultivated, rude, childish and
indecent, still let us have him to the very letter. We want for once the
genuine man. We would have a mediæval Arab telling the tales and
traditions with the lays and legends of his own land in his own way, and
showing the world what he has remained and how he has survived to
this day, while we Westerns have progressed in culture and refinement.
Above all things give us the naïve and plain-spoken language of the
original—such a contrast with the English of our times—and show us, by
the side of these <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfantillages</span></i>, the accumulated wit and wisdom, life-knowledge
and experience of an old-world race. We want also the
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">technique</span></i> of the Recueil, its division into nights, its monorhyme, in fact
everything that gives it cachet and character.” Now I could satisfy the
longing, which is legitimate enough, only by annotation, by a running
commentary, as it were, enabling the student to read between the lines
and to understand hints and innuendoes that would otherwise have passed
by wholly unheeded. I determined that subscribers should find in my
book what does not occur in any other, making it a repertory of Eastern
knowledge in its esoteric phase, by no means intended for the many-headed
but solely for the few who are not too wise to learn or so ignorant
as to ignore their own ignorance. I regretted to display the gross and
bestial vices of the original, in the rare places where obscenity becomes
rampant, but not the less I held it my duty to translate the text word for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_437">437</span>word, instead of garbling it and mangling it by perversion and castration.
My rendering (I promised) would be something novel, wholly different
from all other versions, and it would leave very little for any future
interpreter.<a id="r454"></a><a href="#f454" class="c011"><sup>[454]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c000">And I resolved that, in case of the spiteful philanthropy and the
rabid pornophobic suggestion of certain ornaments of the Home-Press
being acted upon, to appear in Court with my version of The Nights in
one hand and bearing in the other the Bible (especially the Old Testament,
a free translation from an ancient Oriental work) and Shakespeare,
with Petronius Arbiter and Rabelais by way of support and reserve. The
two former are printed by millions; they find their way into the hands
of children, and they are the twin columns which support the scanty
edifice of our universal home-reading. The Arbiter is sotadical as Abú
Nowás and the Curé of Meudon is surpassing in what appears uncleanness
to the eye of outsight not of insight. Yet both have been translated
textually and literally by eminent Englishmen and gentlemen, and have
been printed and published as an “extra series” by Mr. Bohn’s most
respectable firm and sold by Messieurs Bell and Daldy. And if The
Nights are to be bowdlerised for students, why not, I again ask, mutilate
Plato and Juvenal, the Romances of the Middle Ages, Boccaccio and
Petrarch and the Elizabethan dramatists one and all? What hypocrisy
to blaterate about The Nights in presence of such triumphs of the
Natural! How absurd to swallow such camels and to strain at my
midge!</p>

<p class="c000">But I had another object while making the notes a Repertory of
Eastern knowledge in its esoteric form (Foreword p. xix). Having failed
to free the Anthropological Society from the fetters of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</span></i> and
the mock-modesty which compels travellers and ethnological students to
keep silence concerning one side of human nature (and that side the most
interesting to mankind), I proposed to supply the want in these pages.
The England of our day would fain bring up both sexes and keep all ages
in profound ignorance of sexual and intersexual relations; and the consequences
<span class="pageno" id="Page_438">438</span>of that imbecility are peculiarly cruel and afflicting. How
often do we hear women in Society lamenting that they have absolutely
no knowledge of their own physiology; and at what heavy price must this
fruit of the knowledge-tree be bought by the young first entering life.
Shall we ever understand that ignorance is not innocence? What an
absurdum is a veteran officer who has spent a quarter-century in the East
without learning that all Moslem women are circumcised, and without a
notion of how female circumcision is effected; without an idea of the
difference between the Jewish and the Moslem rite as regards males;
without an inkling of the Armenian process whereby the cutting is concealed,
and without the slightest theoretical knowledge concerning the
mental and spiritual effect of the operation. Where then is the shame
of teaching what it is shameful not to have learnt? But the ultra-delicacy,
the squeamishness of an age which is by no means purer or more virtuous
than its ruder predecessors, has ended in trenching upon the ridiculous.
Let us see what the modern English woman and her Anglo-American
sister have become under the working of a mock-modesty which too often
acts cloak to real <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dévergondage</span></i>; and how Respectability unmakes what
Nature made. She has feet but no “toes”; ankles but no “calves”;
knees but no “thighs”; a stomach but no “belly” nor “bowels”; a heart
but no “bladder” nor “groin”; a liver and no “kidneys”; hips and
no “haunches”; a bust and nor “backside” nor “buttocks”: in fact, she
is a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">monstrum</span>, a figure fit only to frighten the crows.</p>

<p class="c000">But the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> knows nothing of these things, and the “decent
gentleman,” like the lady who doth protest overmuch, persistently fixes
his eye upon a single side of the shield. “Probably no European has
ever gathered such an appalling collection of degrading customs and
statistics of vice as is contained in Captain Burton’s translation of the
‘Arabian Nights’” (p. 185). He finds in the case of Mr. Payne, like
myself, “no adequate justification for flooding the world (!) with an ocean
of filth” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ibid.</span></i>) showing that he also can be (as said the past-master of catchwords,
the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">primus verborum artifex</span></i>) “an interested rhetorician inebriated
with the exuberance of his own verbosity.” But <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">audi alteram partem</span></i>—my
view of the question. I have no apology to make for the details offered to
the students of Moslem usages and customs, who will find in them much to
learn and more to suggest the necessity of learning. On no wise ashamed am
I of lecturing upon these esoteric matters, the most important to humanity,
at a time when their absence from the novel of modern society veils with a
double gloom the night-side of human nature. Nay, I take pride to myself for
so doing in the face of silly prejudice and miserable hypocrisy, and I venture
to hold myself in the light of a public benefactor. In fact, I consider my
labours as a legacy bequeathed to my countrymen at a most critical time
when England the puissantest of Moslem powers is called upon, without
adequate knowledge of the Moslem’s inner life, to administer Egypt as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_439">439</span>well as to rule India. And while Pharisee and Philister may be or may
pretend to be “shocked” and “horrified” by my pages, the sound
common sense of a public, which is slowly but surely emancipating itself
from the prudish and prurient reticences and the immodest and immoral
modesties of the early xixth century, will in good time do me, I am convinced,
full and ample justice.</p>

<p class="c000">In p. 184 the Reviewer sneers at me for writing “Roum” in lieu of
Rum or Rúm; but what would the latter have suggested to the home-reader
save a reference to the Jamaican drink? He also corrects me
(vol. v. 248) in the matter of the late Mr. Emanuel Deutsch (p. 184), who
excised “our Saviour” from the article on the Talmud reprinted amongst
his literary remains. The Reviewer, or inspirer of the Review, let me own,
knew more of Mr. Deutsch than I, a simple acquaintance, could know;
but perhaps he does not know all, and if he did he probably would not
publish his knowledge. The truth is that Mr. Deutsch was, during his
younger years, a liberal, nay, a latitudinarian in religion, differing little
from the so-styled “Christian Unitarian.” But when failing health drove
him to Egypt and his hour drew nigh he became (and all honour to him!)
the scrupulous and even fanatical Hebrew of the Hebrews; he consorted
mainly with the followers and divines of his own faith, and it is said that
he ordered himself when dying to be taken out of bed and placed upon
the bare floor. The “Saviour” of the article was perhaps written in his
earlier phase of religious thought, and it was excised as the end drew in
sight.</p>

<p class="c000">“Captain Burton’s experience in the East seems to have obliterated
any (all?) sentiments of chivalry, for he is never weary of recording
disparaging estimates of women, and apparently delights in discovering
evidence of ‘feminine devilry’” (p. 184). This <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum ad feminam</span></i>
is sharpish practice, much after the manner of the Christian “Fathers of
the Church” who, themselves vehemently doubting the existence of souls
non-masculine, falsely and foolishly ascribed the theory and its consequences
to Mohammed and the Moslems. And here the Persian
proverb holds good “Harf-i-kufr kufr níst”—to speak of blasphemy is not
blasphemous. Curious readers will consult the article “Woman” in my
Terminal Essay (x. 192), which alone refutes this silly scandal. I never
pretended to understand woman, and, as Balzac says, no wonder man fails
when He who created her was by no means successful. But in The
Nights we meet principally Egyptian maids, matrons and widows, of whose
“devilry” I cannot speak too highly, and in this matter even the pudibund
Lane is as free-spoken as myself. Like the natives of warm, damp and
malarious lowlands and river-valleys adjacent to rugged and healthy
uplands, such as Mazanderán, Sind, Malabar and California, the passions
and the sexual powers of the females greatly exceed those of their males,
and hence a notable development of the crude form of polyandry popularly
<span class="pageno" id="Page_440">440</span>termed whoredom. Nor have the women of the Nile-valley improved
under our rule. The last time I visited Cairo a Fellah wench, big, burly
and boisterous, threatened one morning, in a fine new French avenue off
the Ezbekiyah Gardens, to expose her person unless bought off with a
piastre. And generally the condition of womenkind throughout the Nile-valley
reminded me of that frantic outbreak of debauchery which characterised
Afghanistan during its ill-judged occupation by Lord Auckland,
and Sind after the conquest by Sir Charles Napier.</p>

<p class="c000">“Captain Burton actually depends upon the respectable and antiquated
D’Herbelot for his information” (p. 184). This silly skit at the two great
French Orientalists, D’Herbelot and Galland, is indeed worthy of a clique
which, puff and struggle however much it will, can never do a tithe of the
good work found in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque Orientale</span></i>. The book was issued in
an unfinished state; in many points it has been superseded, during its life
of a century and a half, by modern studies, but it is still a mine of facts, and
a revised edition would be a boon to students. Again, I have consulted
Prof. Palmer’s work, and the publications of the Palæographical Society
(p. 184); but I nowhere find proofs that the Naskhi character (vol. i. 128)
so long preceded the Cufic which, amongst vulgar Moslems, is looked
upon like black letter in Europe. But Semitic epigraphy is only now
entering upon its second stage of study, the first being mere tentative
ignorance: about 80 years ago the illustrious De Sacy proved, in a
learned memoir, the non-existence of letters in Arabia before the days of
Mohammed. But Palmer,<a id="r455"></a><a href="#f455" class="c011"><sup>[455]</sup></a> Halevy, Robertson Smith, Doughty and Euting
have changed all that, and Herr Eduard Glaser of Prague is now bringing
back from Sana’á some 390 Sabæan epigraphs—a mass of new-old literature.</p>

<p class="c000">And now, having passed in review, and having been much scandalised
by “the extravagant claims of the complete translations over the Standard
Version”—a term which properly applies only to the Editio princeps,
3 vols. 8vo.—the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> delivers a parting and insolent sting. “The
different versions, however, have each its proper destination—Galland for
the nursery, Lane for the library, Payne for the study, and Burton for the
sewers” (p. 184). I need hardly attempt to precise the ultimate and well-merited
office of his article: the gall in that ink may enable it hygienically
to excel for certain purposes the best of “curl-papers.” Then our critic
passes to the history of the work, concerning which nothing need be said:
it is bodily borrowed from Lane’s Preface (pp. ix.–xv.), and his Terminal
Review (iii. 735–47) with a few unimportant and uninteresting details taken
from Al-Makrízí, and probably from the studies of the late Rogers Bey
(pp. 191–92). Here the cult of the Uncle and Master emerges most
<span class="pageno" id="Page_441">441</span>extravagantly. “It was Lane who first brought out the importance of the
‘Arabian Nights’ as constituting a picture of Moslem life and manners”
(p. 192); thus wholly ignoring the claims of Galland, to whom and whom
alone the honour is due. But almost every statement concerning the
French Professor involves more or less of lapse. “It was in 1704 that
Antoine Galland, sometime of the French embassy at Constantinople, but
then professor at the Collège de France, presented the world with the
contents of an Arab Manuscript which he had brought from Syria, and
which bore the title of ‘The Thousand Nights and One Night’” (p. 167),
thus ignoring the famous <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il a fallu le faire venir de Syrie</span></cite>. At that time
(1704) Galland was still at Caen in the employ of “L’intendant Fouquet”;
and he brought with him no MS., as he himself expressly assures us in
Preface to his first volume. Here are two telling mistakes in one page,
and in the next (p. 168) we find “As a professed translation Galland’s
‘<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mille et une Nuits</span>’ (N.B. the Frenchman always wrote <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mille et une
Nuit</span></cite>,)<a id="r456"></a><a href="#f456" class="c011"><sup>[456]</sup></a> is an audacious fraud.” It requires something more than
“audacity” to offer such misstatement even in the pages of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>,
and can anything be falser than to declare “the whole of the last fourteen
tales have nothing whatever to do with the ‘Nights’”?</p>

<p class="c000">These <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bévues</span></i>, which give us the fairest measure for the Reviewer’s
competence to review, are followed (p. 189) by a series of obsolete assertions.
“The highest authority on this point (the date) is the late
Mr. Lane, who states his unqualified conviction that the tales represent
the social life of mediæval Egypt, and he selects a period approaching
the close of the fifteenth century as the probable date of collection,
though some of the tales are, he believes, rather later” (p. 189).
Mr. Lane’s studies upon the subject were painfully perfunctory. He
distinctly states (Preface, p. xii.) that “the work was commenced and completed
by one man,” or a least that “one man completed what another
commenced.” With a marvellous want of critical acumen he could not
distinguish the vast difference of style and diction, treatment and sentiments
which at once strikes every intelligent reader, and which proves
incontestably that many hands took part in the Great Saga-book. He
speaks of “Galland’s very imperfect MS.,” but he never took the trouble
to inspect the three volumes in question which are still in the Bibliothèque
Nationale. And when he opines that “it (the work) was most probably
not commenced earlier than the fifteenth century of our era” (Pref. p. xiii.)
M. Hermann Zotenberg, judging from the style of writing, would attribute
the MS. to the beginning<a id="r457"></a><a href="#f457" class="c011"><sup>[457]</sup></a> of the xivth century. The French Savant has
printed a specimen page in his <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire d’ ’Alâ al-Dîn</span></cite> (p. 6; see my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_442">442</span>Suppl. vol. iii., Foreword p. ix.); and now, at the request of sundry
experts, he is preparing for publication other proofs which confirm his
opinion. We must correct Lane’s fifteenth century to thirteenth century—a
difference of only 200 years.<a id="r458"></a><a href="#f458" class="c011"><sup>[458]</sup></a></p>

<p class="c000">After this unhappy excursus the Reviewer proceeds to offer a most
unintelligent estimate of the Great Recueil. “Enchantment” may be
“a constant motive,” but it is wholly secondary and subservient: “the
true and universal theme is love;” “‘all are but the ministers of love’
absolutely subordinate to the great theme” (p. 193). This is the usual
half-truth and whole unfact. Love and war, or rather war and love, form
the bases of all romantic fiction even as they are the motor power of the
myriad forms and fashions of dancing. This may not appear from Lane’s
mangled and mutilated version, which carefully omits all the tales of
chivalry and conquest as the History of Gharíb and his brother ’Ajíb
(vol. vi. 257) and that of Omar ibn Al-Nu’umán, “which is, as a whole, so
very unreadable” (p. 172) though by no means more so than our European
romances. But the reverse is the case with the original composition.
Again, “These romantic lovers who will go through fire to meet each
other, are not in themselves interesting characters: it may be questioned
whether they have any character at all” (p. 195). “The story and not
the delineation of character is the essence of the ‘Arabian Nights’”
(p. 196). I can only marvel at the utter want of comprehension and
appreciation with which this critic read what he wrote about: one hemisphere
of his brain must have been otherwise occupied and his mental
cecity makes him a phenomenon even amongst reviewers. He thus
ignores all the lofty morale of the work, its marvellous pathos and humour,
its tender sentiment and fine touches of portraiture, the personal individuality
and the nice discrimination between the manifold heroes and
heroines which combine to make it a book for all time.</p>

<p class="c000">The critic ends his article with doing what critics should carefully
avoid to do. After shrewdly displaying his powers of invective and
depreciation he has submitted to his readers a sample of his own workmanship.
He persists in writing “Zobeyda,” “Khalifa,” “Aziza”
(p. 194) and “Kahramana” (p. 199) without the terminal aspirate which, in
Arabic if not in Turkish, is a <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">sine quâ non</span></i> (see my Suppl. vol. v. 419).
He preserves the pretentious blunder “The Khalif” (p. 193), a word
which does not exist in Arabic. He translates (p. 181), although I have
taught him to do better, “Hádimu ’l-Lizzáti wa Mufarriku ’l-Jama’át,”
by “Terminator of Delights and Separator of Companies” instead of
Destroyer of delights and Severer of societies. And lastly he pads the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_443">443</span>end of his article (pp. 196–199) with five dreary extracts from Lane
(i. 372–373) who can be dull even when translating the Immortal Barber.</p>

<p class="c000">The first quotation is so far changed that the peppering of commas
(three to the initial line of the original) disappears to the reader’s gain,
Lane’s textual date (App. 263) is also exchanged for that of the notes
(A.H. 653); and the “æra of Alexander,” A.M. 7320, an absurdity which
has its value in proving the worthlessness of such chronology, is clean
omitted, because Lane used the worthless Bul. Edit. The latinisms due
to Lane show here in force—“Looked for a considerable time” (Maliyyan
 = for a long while); “there is an announcement that presenteth itself to
me” (a matter which hath come to my knowledge), and “thou hast dissipated<a id="r459"></a><a href="#f459" class="c011"><sup>[459]</sup></a>
my mind” (Azhakta rúhí = thou scatterest my wits, in the Calc.
Edit. Saghgharta rúhí = thou belittlest my mind). But even Lane
never wrote “I only required thee to shave my head”—the adverb
thus qualifying, as the ignoramus loves to do, the wrong verb—for “I
required thee only to shave my head.” In the second <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">échantillon</span></i> we have
“a piece of gold” as equivalent of a quarter-dinar and “for God’s sake”
which certainly does not preserve local colour. In No. 3 we find “‘May
God,’ said I,” etc.; “There is no deity but God! Mohammed is God’s
apostle!”. Here Allah ought invariably to be used, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> “Mohammed is the
Apostle of Allah,” unless the English name of the Deity be absolutely
required as in “There is no god but <em>the</em> God.” The Moslem’s “Wa’lláhi”
must not be rendered “By God,” a verbal translation and an absolute
non-equivalent; the terms Jehovah, Allah and God and the use of them
involving manifold fine distinctions. If it be true that God made man,
man in his turn made and mismade God who thus becomes a Son of Man
and a mere racial type. I need not trouble my reader with further
notices of these extracts whose sole use is to show the phenomenal dullness
of Lane’s latinised style: I prefer even Torrens (p. 273).</p>

<p class="c000">“We have spoken severely with regard to the last” (my version) says
the Reviewer (p. 185) and verily I thank him therefor. Laudari ab
illaudato has never been my ambition. A writer so learned and so
disinterested could hurt my feelings and mortify my pride only by
approving me and praising me. Nor have I any desire to be exalted
in the pages of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>, so famous for its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">incartades</span></i> of old. As
Dryden says “he has done me all the honour that any man can receive
from him, which is to be railed at by him.” I am content to share the
vituperation of this veteran-incapable in company with the poetaster
George Gordon who suffered for “this Lord’s station;” with that
“burnisht fly in the pride of May,” Macaulay; and with the great trio,
Darwin, Huxley and Hooker, who also have been the butts of his bitter
<span class="pageno" id="Page_444">444</span>and malignant abuse (April ’63 and April ’73). And lastly I have no
stomach for sweet words from the present Editor of the <cite>Edinburgh</cite>,
Mr. Henry Reeve, a cross and cross-grained old man whose surly temper
is equalled only by his ignoble jealousy of another’s success. Let them
bedevil the thin-skinned with their godless ribaldry; for myself <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">peu
m’importe</span></i>—my shoulders are broad enough to bear all their envy, hatred
and malice.</p>

<p class="c000">During the three years which have elapsed since I first began printing
my book I have not had often to complain of mere gratuitous impertinence
and a single exception deserves some notice. The following lines
which I addressed to <cite>The Academy</cite> (August 11 ’88) will suffice to lay my
case before my readers:—</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>THE BESTIAL ELEMENT IN MAN.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c012">“One hesitates to dissent from so great an authority as Sir Richard Burton on all
that relates to the bestial element in man.” So writes (p. xli., Introduction to the
Fables of Pilpay), with uncalled for impertinence, Mr. Joseph Jacobs, who goes out of
his way to be offensive, and who confesses to having derived all his knowledge of my
views not from “the notorious Terminal Essay of the Nights,” but from the excellent
article by Mr. Thomas Davidson on “Beast-fables,” in Chambers’s <cite>Cyclopædia</cite>,
Edinburgh, 1888. This lofty standpoint of morality was probably occupied for a reason
by a writer who dedicates “To my dear wife” a volume rich in <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">anecdotes grivoises</span></i>,
and not poor in language the contrary of conventional. However, I suffer from this
Maccabee in good society together with Prof. Max Müller (pp. xxvi. and xxxiii.), Mr.
Clouston (pp. xxxiii. and xxxv.), Byron (p. xlvi.), Theodor Benfey (p. xlvii.), Mr.
W. G. Rutherford (p. xlviii.), and Bishop Lightfoot (p. xlix.). All this eminent halfdozen
is glanced at, with distinct and several sneers, in a little volume which, rendered
useless by lack of notes and index, must advertise itself by the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</span></i> of abuse.</p>

<p class="c012">As regards the reminiscence of <em>Homo Darwiniensis</em> by <em>Homo Sapiens</em>, doubtless it
would <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex hypothesi</span></i> be common to mankind. Yet to me Africa is the old home of the
Beast-fable, because Egypt was the inventor of the alphabet, the cradle of letters, the
preacher of animism and metempsychosis, and, generally, the source of all human
civilisation.</p>

<h3 class="c015">THE CRITIC IN ANGLO-AMERICA.</h3>

<p class="c027">The <cite>Boston Daily Advertiser</cite> (Jan. 26 ’86) contains the following
choice <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morceau</span></i> which went the round of the Transatlantic Press:—</p>

<p class="c012">G. W. S. writes from London to the <cite>New York Tribune</cite> in regard to Captain
Burton’s notorious translation of the “Arabian Nights.” Of Captain Burton’s translation
of “The Arabian Nights,” two volumes have now appeared. Before anything
had been seen of them, I gave some account of this scheme, and of the material on
which he had worked, with a statement of the reasons which made all existing versions
unsatisfactory to the student, and incomplete. Captain Burton saw fit to reprint these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_445">445</span>desultory paragraphs as a kind of circular or advertisement on his forthcoming book.
He did not think it necessary to ask leave to do this, nor did I know to what use my
letter had been put till it was too late to object. In any ordinary case it would have
been of no consequence, but Captain Burton’s version is of such a character that I wish
to state the facts, and to say that when I wrote my letter I had never seen a line of his
translation, and had no idea that what I said of his plans would be used for the purpose
it has been, or for any purpose except to be printed in your columns. As it is, I am
made to seem to give some sort of approval to a book which I think offensive, and not
only offensive, but grossly and needlessly offensive. If anybody has been induced to
subscribe for it by what I wrote I regret it, and both to him and to myself I think this
explanation due.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Smalley is the London correspondent of the <cite>New York Tribune</cite>,
which represents Jupiter Tonans in the Western World. He may be
unable to write with independent tone—few Anglo-Americans can afford to
confront the crass and compound ignorance of a “free and independent
majority;”—but even he is not called upon solemnly to state an untruth.
Before using Mr. Smalley’s article as a circular, my representative made a
point of applying to him for permission, as he indeed was bound to do
by the simplest rules of courtesy. Mr. Smalley replied at once, willingly
granting the favour, as I can prove by the note still in my possession;
and presently, frightened by the puny yelping of a few critical curs at
home, he has the effrontery to deny the fact.</p>

<p class="c000">In my last volumes I have been materially aided by two Anglo-American
friends MM. Thayer and Cotheal and I have often had cause
to thank the <cite>Tribune</cite> and the <cite>Herald</cite> of New York for generously
appreciating my labours. But no gratitude from me is due to the small
fry of the Transatlantic Press which has welcomed me with spiteful little
pars., mostly borrowed from unfriends in England and mainly touching
upon style and dollars. In the <cite>Mail Express</cite> of New York (September
7, ’85) I read, “Captain Richard Burton, traveller and translator,
intends to make all the money that there may be in his translation of the
‘Arabian Nights.’ * * * If he only fills his list, and collects his
money he will be in easy circumstances for the remainder of his days.”
In a subsequent issue (Oct. 24) readers are told that I have been requested
not to publish the rest of the series under pain of legal prosecution.
In the same paper (October 31, ’85: see also November 7, ’85) I
find:—</p>

<p class="c012">The authorities have discovered where Capt. Burton’s “Thousand and One Nights”
is being printed, despite the author’s efforts to keep the place a secret, but are undecided
whether to suppress it or to permit the publication of the coming volumes. Burton’s own
foot-notes are so voluminous that they exceed the letterpress of the text proper, and make
up the bulk of the work.<a id="r460"></a><a href="#f460" class="c011"><sup>[460]</sup></a> The foulness of the second volume of his translation places it
at a much higher premium in the market than the first.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_446">446</span>The <cite>Tribune</cite> of Chicago (October 26, ’85) honours me by declaring
“It has been resolved to request Captain Burton not to publish the rest
of his translation of the ‘Thousand and One Nights,’ which is really
foul and slipshod as to style.” The <cite>New York Times</cite> (October 17 and
November 9, ’85) merely echoes the spite of its English confrère:—</p>

<p class="c012">Capt. Burton’s translation of the “Arabian Nights” bears the imprint “Benares.”
Of course the work never saw Benares. America, France, Belgium and Germany have
all been suggested as the place of printing, and now the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> affirms that
the work was done “north of the Tweed.” There is, without doubt, on British soil, it
says, “a press which year after year produces scores of obscene publications.”</p>

<p class="c000">And the same is the case with the <cite>St. Louis Post Dispatch</cite> (November
11, ’85); the <cite>Mail Express</cite> of New York (November 23, ’85); the
<cite>Weekly Post</cite> of Boston (November 27, ’85) which again revives a false
report and with the <cite>Boston Herald</cite> (December 16, ’85). The <cite>Chicago
Daily News</cite> (January 30, ’86) contains a malicious sneer at the
Kamashastra Society. The <cite>American Register</cite> (Paris, July 25, ’86)
informs its <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span></i>, “If, as is generally supposed, Captain Burton’s book
is printed abroad, the probability is that every copy will on arrival be
confiscated as ‘indecent’ by the Custom-house.” And to curtail a long
list of similar <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fadaises</span></i> I will quote the <cite>Bookmart</cite> (of Pittsburg, Pa.
U.S.A., October, ’86): “Sir Richard Burton’s ‘Nights’ are terribly in
want of the fig-leaf, if anything less than a cabbage-leaf will do, before they
can be fit (fitted?) for family reading. It is not possible (Is it not
possible?) that by the time a household selection has been sifted out of the
great work, everything which makes the originality and the value—such as
it is—of Richard’s series of volumes will have disappeared, and nothing
will remain but his diverting lunacies of style.” The <cite>Bookmart</cite>, I am
informed, is edited by one Halkett Lord, an unnaturalised Englishman
who finds it pays best to abuse everything and everyone English. And
lastly the <cite>Springfield Republican</cite> (April 5, ’88) assures me that I have
published “fully as much as the (his?) world wants of the ‘Nights’.”</p>

<p class="c000">In the case of “The Nights,” I am exposed to that peculiar Protestant
form of hypocrisy, so different from the Tartuffean original of Catholicism,
and still as mighty a motor force, throughout the length and breadth of
the North-American continent, as within the narrow limits of England.
There also as here it goes hand-in-hand with “Respectability” to blind
judgment and good sense.</p>

<p class="c000">A great surgeon of our day said (or is said to have said) in addressing
his students:—“Never forget, gentlemen, that you have to deal with an
ignorant public.” The dictum may fairly be extended from medical
knowledge to general information amongst the many-headed of England;
and the Publisher, when rejecting a too recondite book, will repeat parrot-fashion,
The English public is not a learned body. Equally valid is the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_447">447</span>statement in the case of the Anglo-American community which is still
half-educated and very far from being erudite. The vast country has
produced a few men of great and original genius, such as Emerson and
Theodore Parker, Edgar Allan Poe and Walt. Whitman; but the sum
total is as yet too small to leaven the mighty mass which learns its
rudiments at school and college and which finishes its education with the
newspaper and the lecture. When Emerson died it was said that the
intellectual glory of a continent had departed; but Edgar A. Poe, the
peculiar poetic glory of the States, the first Transatlantic who dared be
himself and who disdained to borrow from Schiller and Byron, the outlander
poet who, as Edgar Allan Poé, is now the prime favourite in France,
appears to be still under ban because he separated like Byron from his
spouse, and he led a manner of so-called “Bohemian” life. Indeed the
wide diffusion of letters in the States, that favourite theme for boasting
and bragging over the unenlightened and analphabetic Old World, has
tended only to exaggerate the defective and disagreeable side of a national
character lacking geniality and bristling with prickly individuality. This
disposition of mind, whose favourable and laudable presentations are love of
liberty and self-reliance, began with the beginnings of American history.
The “Fathers,” Pilgrim and Puritan, who left their country for their
country’s good and their own, fled from lay tyranny and clerkly oppression
only to oppress and tyrannise over others in new and distant homes. Hardly
had a century and a half elapsed before the sturdy colonists, who did not
claim freedom but determined to keep it, formally revolted and fought their
way to absolute independence—not, by-the-by, a feat whereof to be overproud
when a whole country rose unanimously against a handful of troops. The
movement, however, reacted powerfully upon the politics of Europe which
stood agape for change, and undoubtedly precipitated the great French
Revolution. As soon as the States became an empire, their democratic
and republican institutions at once attracted hosts of emigrants from the
Old World, thus peopling the land with a selection of species: the active
and the adventurous, the malcontent and the malefactor readily expatriate
themselves while the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre diable</span></i> remains at home. The potato-famine
in Ireland (1848) gave an overwhelming impetus to the exode of a race
which had never known a racial baptism; and, lastly, the Germans flying
from the conscription, the blood-tax of the Fatherland, carried with them
over the ocean a transcendentalism which has engendered the wildest
theories of socialism and communism. And the emigration process still
continues. Whole regions, like the rugged Bocche di Cattaro in Dalmatia
and pauper Iceland, are becoming depopulated: to me the wonder is that
a poor man ever consents to live out of America or a rich man to live
in it.</p>

<p class="c000">The result of such selection has been two-fold. The first appears in
a splendid self-esteem, a complacency, a confidence which passes all
<span class="pageno" id="Page_448">448</span>bounds of the golden mean. “I am engrossed in calmly contemplating
the grandeur of my native country and her miraculous growth,” writes
to me an old literary friend. The feeling normally breaks out in the
grossest laudation of everything American. The ultra-provincial twang
which we still hear amongst the servant-classes of Lancashire and Yorkshire,
and which is so notable in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nouveau riche</span></i>, modified by traditional
nasalisation and, as in Australia, by climatic influences, is American
and, therefore, the purest of English utterances. The obsolete vocabulary—often
obsolete in England without just reason—contrasting with
a modern disfigured etymology which strips vocables of their genealogy
and history, is American and <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergò</span></i> admirably progressive. The spurious
facetiousness which deals mainly in mere jargon, words ill-spelt and
worse pronounced; in bizarre contrast of ideas, and in ultra-Rabelaisian
exaggeration, is American wit and humour—therefore unsurpassable. The
Newspaper Press, that great reflector of nationalities, that prime expression
of popular taste, too often of an <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">écœurant</span></i> vulgarity, personal beyond
all bounds of common decency, sensational as a transpontine drama, is
American; America is the greatest nation upon earth’s face; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergò</span></i> the
daily sheet is setting-up the standard of English speech and forming the
language of the Future, good and too good for all the world. This low
standard of the Press is the more regretable as its exalted duty is at
present to solve the highest problems social and industrial, such as
co-operation in labour, the development of fisheries, direct taxation
versus indirect and a host of enigmas which the young world, uncumbered
by the burdens of the Old World, alone shall unravel.</p>

<p class="c000">The second result is still more prejudicial and perilous. This is
the glorification of mediocrity, of the average man and woman whose
low standard must be a norm to statesman and publicist. Such cult of
the common and the ignoble is the more prejudicial because it “wars
against all distinction and against the sense of elevation to be gained by
respecting and admiring superiority.” Its characteristic predominance
in a race which, true to its Anglo-Saxon origin, bases and builds the
strongest opinions upon the weakest foundations, hinders the higher
Avatars of genius and interferes with the “chief duty of a nation which is
to produce great men.” It accounts for the ever-incroaching reign of
women in literature—meaning as a rule cheap work and second-rate.
And the main lack is not so much the “thrill of awe,” which Goethe
pronounces to be the best thing humanity possesses, but that discipline of
respect, that sense of loyalty, not in its confined meaning of attachment
to royalty, but in a far higher and nobler signification, the recognising
and welcoming elevation and distinction whatever be the guise they
may assume. “The soul lives by admiration and hope and love.”</p>

<p class="c000">And here we see the shady side of the educational process, the diffusion
of elementary and superficial knowledge, of the veneer and polish
<span class="pageno" id="Page_449">449</span>which mask, until chipped-off, the raw and unpolished material lying
hidden beneath them. A little learning is a dangerous thing because it
knows all and consequently it stands in the way of learning more or
much. Hence it is sorely impatient of novelty, of improvement, of originality.
It is intolerant of contradiction, irritable, thin-skinned, and
impatient of criticism, of a word spoken against it. It is chargeable with
the Law of Copyright, which is not only legalised plunder of the foreigner,
but is unfair, unjust and ungenerous to native talent for the exclusive
benefit of the short-sighted many-headed. I am far from charging the
United States with the abomination called “International Copyright;”
the English publisher is as sturdy an enemy to “protection” as the
Transatlantic statesman; but we expect better things from a new people
which enjoys the heritage of European civilisation without the sufferings accompanying
the winning of it. This mediocrity has the furious, unpardoning
hatred of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l’amour propre offensé</span></i>. Even a word in favour of my old friends
the Mormons is an unpardonable offence: the dwarfish and dwarfing demon
“Respectability” has made their barbarous treatment a burning shame
to a so-called “free” country: they are subjected to slights and wrongs only
for practising polygamy, an institution never condemned by Christ or the
early Christians. The calm and dispassionate judgments of Sir Lepel
Griffith and the late Matthew Arnold, who ventured to state, in guarded
language, that the boasted civilisation of the United States was not quite
perfect, resulted in the former being called a snob and the latter a liar.
English stolidity would only have smiled at the criticism even had it
been couched in the language of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">persiflage</span></i>. And when M. Max O’Rell
traverses the statements of the two Englishmen and exaggerates American
civilisation, we must bear in mind first that <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">la vulgarité ne se traduit pas</span></i>,
and secondly, that the foes of our foemen are our friends. Woe be to the
man who refuses to fall down and do worship before that brazen-faced
idol (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eidolon Novi Mundi</span></i>), Public Opinion in the States; unless, indeed,
his name be Brown and he hail from Briggsville.</p>

<p class="c000">Some years ago I proposed to write a paper upon the reflex action
of Anglo-America upon England, using as a base the last edition of Mrs.
Trollope, who was compelled to confess that almost every peculiarity
which she had abused in her first issue had become naturalised at home.
Yankee cuteness has already displaced in a marvellous way old English
rectitude and plain-dealing; gambling on the Stock Exchange, cornering,
booms and trusts have invaded the trading-classes from merchant-princes to
shopkeepers and threaten, at their actual rate of progress, not to leave us an
honest man. But now the student’s attention will be called to the great
and ever-growing influence of the New World upon the Old, and notably
upon Europe. Some 50,000 Americans annually visit the continent,
they are rapidly becoming the most important item of the floating population,
and in a few years they will number 500,000. Meanwhile they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_450">450</span>are revolutionising all the old institutions; they are abolishing the classical
cicerone whose occupation is gone amongst a herd which wants only
to see streets and people: they greatly increase the cost of travelling;
they pay dollars in lieu of francs, and they are satisfied with inferior
treatment at superior prices:—hence the American hotel abroad is carefully
shunned by Englishmen and natives. At home the “well-to-do-class”
began by regarding their kinsmen <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d’outre mer</span> with contemptuous
dislike; then they looked upon them as a country squire would regard a
junior branch which has emigrated and has thriven by emigration; and now
they are welcomed in Society because they amuse and startle and stir up
the duller depths. But however warm may be private friendship
between Englishmen and Anglo-Americans there is no public sympathy
nor is any to be expected from the present generation. “New England
does not understand Old England and never will,” the reverse being
equally the fact. “The Millennium must come” says Darwin (ii. 387)
“before nations love each other:” I add that first <em>Homo alalus</em> seu <em>Pithecanthropus</em>
must become <em>Homo Sapiens</em> and cast off his moral slough—egoism
and ignorance. Mr. Cleveland, in order to efface the foul stigma of being
the “English President,” found it necessary to adopt the strongest measures
in the matter of “Fisheries;” and the “Irish vote” must quadrennially be
bought at the grave risk of national complications. Despite the much-bewritten
“brotherhood of the two great English-speaking races of the
world,” the old leaven of cousinly ill-feeling, the jealousy which embitters the
Pole against his Russian congener, is still rampant. Uncle Sam actively dislikes
John Bull and dispraises England. An Anglo-American who has lived
years amongst us and in private intimacy must, when he returns home,
speak disparagingly of the old country unless he can afford the expensive
luxury of telling unpopular truths and of affronting Demos, the hydraheaded.</p>

<p class="c000">But there are even now signs of better things in the Great Republic.
Mr. James R. Lowell, an authority (if there be any) upon the subject of
Democracy, after displaying its fine points and favourable aspects in his
addresses to English audiences, has at length had the uncommon courage
to discuss family affairs, and to teach Boston and New York what “weaknesses
and perils there may be in the practical working of a system never
before set in motion under such favourable circumstances, nor on so grand
a scale.” He is emboldened to say firmly and aloud, despite the storming
of false and hollow self-praise, that American civilisation, so strong on the
material side, is sadly wanting on the other, and still lacks much to make
it morally acceptable or satisfactory. And we have home truths concerning
that Fool’s Paradise the glorification of the “average man.” Every citizen
of the world must wish full success to the “Independents” (in politics)
who sit at the feet of so wise and patriotic a teacher.</p>

<p class="c000">And here I feel myself bound to offer some explanation concerning</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_451">451</span>
  <h3 class="c015">THE HOUSEHOLD EDITION OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS,</h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">lest any subscriber charge me, after contracting not to issue or to allow
the issue of a cheaper form, with the sharp practice which may be styled</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To keep the word of promise to our ear</div>
      <div class="line">And break it to our hope.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hardly had my third volume of “The Nights” (proper) been issued to my
patrons when a benevolent subscriber, whose name I am bound to conceal,
apprised me that he had personal and precise information concerning a
project to pirate the production. England and Anglo-America, be it
observed, are the only self-styled civilised countries in the world where an
author’s brain-work is not held to be his private property: his book is
simply no book unless published and entered, after a cost of seven presentation
copies, at “Stationers’ Hall”—its only ægis. France, Italy and
Austria treat such volumes as private MSS.: here any dishonest house may
reproduce them in replica without the slightest regard to the writer’s
rightful rights. In my case this act of robbery was proposed by a German
publisher domiciled in London, supported by a Frenchman equally
industrious, who practises in Paris, and of whose sharp doings in money-matters
not a few Englishmen have had ample reason bitterly to complain.
This <i><span lang="co" xml:lang="co" xml:lang="co">par nobile</span></i> agreed to print in partnership an issue of handier form
and easier price than my edition, and their plan if carried out would have
seriously damaged the property of my subscribers: the series which cost
them £10 10s. would have fallen probably to one-half value. The two
pirates met by agreement in Paris, where the design was duly discussed
and determined; but, fortunately for me, an unexpected obstacle barred
the way. The London solicitor, professionally consulted by the dishonest
firm, gave his opinion that such a work publicly issued would be a boon
to the Society for the Suppression of Vice, and would not escape the
unsavoury attentions of old Father Antic—the Law.</p>

<p class="c000">But, although these two men were deterred by probable consequences,
a bolder spirit might make light of them. I had never intended to go
beyond my original project; that is, of printing one thousand copies and
no more; nor did I believe that any cunning of disguise could make “The
Nights” presentable in conventionally decent society. It was, however,
represented to me by many whose opinions I valued that thus and thus
only the author and his subscribers could be protected from impudent
fraud, and finally an unwilling consent was the result.</p>

<p class="c000">Mr. Justin Huntley McCarthy, a name well known in the annals of
contemporary literature, undertook the task of converting the grand old
<span class="pageno" id="Page_452">452</span>barbarian into a family man to be received by the “best circles.” His
proofs, after due expurgation, were passed on to my wife, who I may say
has never read the original, and she struck out all that appeared to her
over-free, under the promise that no mother should hesitate in allowing
the book to her daughters. It would, perhaps, surprise certain “modest
gentlemen” and blatantly virtuous reviewers that the amount of raw
material excised from the text and the notes, chiefly addressed to
anthropologists and Orientalists, amounts to only 215 pages out of a
grand total numbering 3,156.</p>

<p class="c000">Between 1886 and 1888 appeared the revision in six pretty volumes,
bearing emblematic colours, virgin-white adorned with the golden lilies of
St. Joseph and the “chaste crescent of the young moon.” The price also
was reduced to the lowest (£3 3s.) under the idea that the work would
be welcome if not to families at any rate to libraries and reading-rooms,
for whose benefit the older translations are still being reproduced. But
the flattering tale of Hope again proved to be a snare and a delusion; I
had once more dispensed with the services of Mr. Middleman, the publisher,
and he naturally refused to aid and abet the dangerous innovation.
The hint went abroad that the book belonged to the category which has
borrowed a name from the ingenious Mr. Bowdler, and vainly half a
century of reviewers spoke bravely in its praise. The public would have
none of it: even innocent girlhood tossed aside the chaste volumes in
utter contempt, and would not condescend to aught save the thing, the
whole thing, and nothing but the thing, unexpurgated and uncastrated.
The result was an unexpected and unpleasant study of modern taste in
highly respectable England. And the fact remains that of an edition
which began with a thousand copies only 457 were sold in the course of
two years. Next time I shall see my way more clearly to suit the peculiar
tastes and prepossessions of the reading world at home.</p>

<p class="c000">Before dismissing the subject of the Household Edition, I would offer
a few words of explanation on the part of the Editress. While touching-up
and trimming the somewhat hurried work of our friend, Mr. McCarthy,
she was compelled to accompany me abroad, and to nurse me through a
dangerous illness, which left but little time for the heavy claims of business.
Unable to superintend, with the care required, the issue of her six volumes
she entrusted the task to two agents in whose good will and experience
she had and still has the fullest confidence; but the results were sundry
letters of appeal and indignation from subscribers touching matters wholly
unknown and unintelligible to her. If any mistakes have been made in
matters of detail she begs to express her sincerest regret, and to assure
those aggrieved that nothing was further from her intention than to show
discourtesy where she felt cordial gratitude was due.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_453">453</span>Nothing now remains for me but the pleasant task of naming the many
friends and assistants to whom this sixteenth and last volume has been
inscribed. The late Reverend G. Percy Badger strongly objected to the
literal translation of “The Nights” (<cite>The Academy</cite>, December 8, ’81); not
the less, however, he assisted me in its philology with all readiness. Dr. F.
Grenfell Baker lent me ready and valuable aid in the mechanical part of
my hard labour. Mr. James F. Blumhardt, a practical Orientalist and
teacher of the Prakrit dialects at Cambridge, englished for me the eight
Gallandian tales (Foreword, Supp. vol. iii.) from the various Hindostan
versions. To Mr. William H. Chandler, of Pembroke College, Oxford,
I have expressed (Supp. vol. iii.) the obligations due to a kind and generous
friend: his experiments with photography will serve to reconcile the
churlishness and retrograde legislation of the great Oxford Library with
the manners and customs of more civilised peoples. Mr. W. A. Clouston,
whose degree is high in “Storiology,” supplied my second and third
Supplemental volumes with valuable analogues and variants. Mr. Alexander
J. Cotheal, Consul-General for Nicaragua at New York, sent a
valuable MS. to me across the water, and was persuaded to translate, for
my sixth Supplemental volume, a novel version of the “Tale of Attáf.”
Mr. A. G. Ellis, of the British Museum, amongst other favours kindly
revised the Foreword of my sixth volume. Mr. E. J. W. Gibb, an
Orientalist of the modern and realistic school, who is not deterred by
literal translation, permitted me to print his version of the Turkish Zayn
al-Asnám (Supp. vol. iii.) and translations of three tales which he
judged inexpedient to publish (Supp. vol. iv.). M. O. Houdas, <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Professeur
d’Arabe Vulgaire à l’école des langues Orientales vivantes</span></i>, Paris, copied
for me the Arabic text of Zayn al-Asnám and the whole MS. used by MM.
Chavis and Cazotte: he also obligingly assisted me in overcoming the
various difficulties of a crabbed and imperfect text. My friend, Mr. W.
F. Kirby appended to volume x. 471 of “The Nights” (proper) his most
valuable contributions to the bibliology of the work with its various
imitations and a table showing the contents of the principal editions and
translations of “The Nights”: he also enriched my Supplemental volumes v.
and vi. with his excellent annotations. Mr. Kingsbury (and Notcutt)
photographed for my use 400 and odd pages of the Wortley-Montague MS.,
and proved how easy it was to produce a perfect fac simile of the whole.
Mr. George Lewis gave me the soundest advice touching legal matters and
Mr. Philip M. Justice was induced to take an active interest in the “Household
Edition.” The eminent Orientalist, Dr. Pertsch, Librarian of the
Grand-Ducal Collection, Saxe-Gotha, in lively contrast to my countrymen
of the Bodleian, offered to send me the two volumes of a valuable MS.
containing the most detailed texts of Judar and his brethren (vol. vi. 213)
and of Zahir and his son Ali. Dr. Reinhold Rost, Librarian of the Indian
Office, took much trouble about the W. M. MS. but all in vain. Mr.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_454">454</span>Alexander W. Thayer, of Trieste, who has studied for years the subject of
the so-called Jewish “Exodus,” obliged me with a valuable note detailing
his original views. His Excellency Yacoub Artin Pasha, Minister of Public
Instruction, Cairo, a friend of many years standing, procured for me the
decorations in the Cufic, Naskhí and other characters, which add to much
of novelty and ornament to the outer semblance of my sixteen volumes.
Mr. Hermann Zotenberg, Keeper of Oriental MS. at the Bibliothèque
Nationale, Paris, lent me his own transcription of the “Alaeddin,” and
generously supplied me with exact bibliographical notes and measurements
of sundry tomes in that admirable collection.</p>

<p class="c000">I am also deeply indebted to Mrs. Victoria L. Maylor, of Trieste, who,
during the past three years (1885–1888) had the energy and perseverance
to copy for me sixteen bulky volumes written in a “running-hand,” concerning
which the less said the better. And, lastly, I must acknowledge
peculiar obligations to my Shaykh, Dr. Steingass, Ph. D. This well-known
Arabist not only assisted me in passing the whole work through the press,
he also added a valuable treatise on Arabic Prosody (x. 270–300) with
indexes of various kinds, and finally he supervised the MSS. of the Supplemental
volumes and enriched the last three, which were translated
under peculiar difficulties in unalphabetic lands, with the results of his
wide reading and lexicographical experience.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">And now, Alhamdolillah, the play is ended, and while the curtain
drops, I take the final liberty of addressing my kindly and appreciative

<p class="c027">As the holiday season draws to a close the publishers’ announcements of “new
books” fill column after column of the organs chosen from these special <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqués</span></i>,
But there is one work which is not entered in these lists, though for years scholars, and
many people who are not scholars, have been looking for it with an eagerness which has
left far behind the ordinary curiosity which is bestowed on the greatest of contributions to
current literature. And to-day the chosen few who are in possession of the volume in
question are examining it with an interest proportionate to the long toil which has been
bestowed on its preparation. We refer to Captain Burton’s translation of <cite>The Arabian
Nights Entertainments</cite>, now entitled <cite>The Book of The Thousand Nights and a Night</cite>,
of which the first tome has just been issued. * * * * Captain Burton
scorns any namby-pambyism. In the Arabic a spade is usually called a spade, and
in the latest English translation it is never designated an agricultural implement. Moreover
the endless foot-notes which the editor appends speak with much freedom of many
things usually avoided as themes for conversation in polite society, though they throw a
flood of light on hundreds of features of Oriental life on which, since travellers have
been compelled to write for “refined” audiences, the student has failed to be informed. * * * * * * Yet, admitting that <cite>The Nights</cite> are often coarse and
indelicate, and sometimes even gross, it is a mistake to suppose that they are demoralising
in the same way that a French novel of the Zola type is, or might be. Indeed, what we
would call its impropriety is only a reflection of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïve</span></i> freedom with which talk is to
this day carried on in the family circles of the East. They see no harm in what we
should regard as indecency. So that when Captain Burton prefaces his unbowdlerised
version with the Arab proverb, “To the pure in heart all things are pure,” he presents
perhaps the best defence he could against the attack which it is quite possible may be
made on him for devoting many years of his life to what he terms a “a labour of
love.” * * * Captain Burton, thirty-three years ago, went in the disguise
of an Indian pilgrim to Mecca and Al-Medinah, and no one capable of giving the world
the result of his experience has so minute, so exhaustive a knowledge of Arab and
Oriental life generally. Hence the work now begun—only a limited number of students
can ever see—is simply priceless to any one who concerns himself with such subjects, and
may be regarded as marking an era in the annals of Oriental translation.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">St. James’ Gazette</cite>, <em>September 12th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">One of the most important translations to which a great English scholar has ever
devoted himself is now in the press. For three decades Captain Burton has been more
or less engaged on his translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, the latest of the many
versions of that extraordinary story which has been made into English, the only one at all
worthy of a great original.</p>

</div>

<p class="c027">The publication of the first volume of Captain Burton’s translation of the <cite>Alif
Laïla</cite>, enriches the world of Oriental investigation with a monument of labour and
scholarship and of research. The book is advisedly, and even inevitably, printed for
private circulation, and is intended, as Captain Burton says in his preface, only for the
eyes of such persons as are seriously students of Oriental life and manners, and are
desirous of making a more complete acquaintance with the great masterpieces of Eastern
literature than has hitherto been possible, except to finished Arabic scholars. * * * * * In the name of the whole world of Oriental scholarship, we offer
our heartfelt thanks and congratulations to Captain Burton upon the appearance of this
first volume: and we look forward with the keenest interest for its successors.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Home News</cite>, <em>September 18th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Captain Burton has begun to issue the volumes of his subscription translation of the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, and its fortunate possessors will now be able to realize the full flavour
of Oriental feeling. They will now have the great storehouse of Eastern folk-lore
opened to them, and Captain Burton’s minute acquaintance with Eastern life makes his
comments invaluable. In this respect, as well as in the freeness of the translation, the
version will be distinguished from its many predecessors. Captain Burton’s preface, it
may be observed, bears traces of soreness at official neglect. Indeed it seems curious
that his services could not have been utilised in the Soudan, when the want of competent
Arabic scholars was so severely felt.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Figaro</cite>, <em>September 19th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">A laboured attempt is made in the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> to show that the publication of
the first volume of Captain Burton’s edition of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is a greater outrage
on decency than that of the revelations of Mr. Stead and his associates. The comparison
is monstrous and absurd. Captain Burton’s great work is only intended for men and for
students who desire to acquire a masterly knowledge of Egyptian Arabic; subscribers
only can obtain copies, and but a thousand have been printed.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">I am glad to be able to testify to the ability with which Captain Burton has discharged
the first portion of his Herculean task. The second volume will be looked forward to
with much interest, though I hope attention will be paid to the translator’s appeal.
Captain Burton says that nothing could be more repugnant to his feelings than the idea
of these pages being placed in any other hands than the class for whose especial use the
book has been prepared.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Nottingham Journal</cite>, <em>September 19th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">But to scholars and men who have sufficient love of the soul of these sweet stories
to discern the form in its true proportions, the new edition will be welcome. From an
Oriental point of view the work is masterly to a degree. The quatrains and couplets,
reading like verses from Elizabethan mantels, and forming a perfect rosary of Eastern
lore, the constant succession of brilliant pictures, and the pleasure of meeting again our
dear old friend Shahrázád, all these combine to give a unique charm and interest to this
“perfect expositor of the mediæval Moslem mind.”</p>

</div>

<p class="c027">The first volume of Captain Burton’s <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>, printed at
Benares by the Kamashastra Society for subscribers only, has been delivered to the latter.
If the other nine portions equal the first, English literature will be the richer by a work
the like of which is rare. The English is strong and vitally idiomatic. It is the English
of Shakespeare and Jeremy Taylor, the English of Robert Browning, with a curiously
varied admixture of modern colloquial phraseology. I confess that I was not prepared,
familiar as I was with Captain Burton’s other work, to find so perfect a command of
clear and vigorous style on the part of the great traveller and Oriental scholar. Mrs.
Grundy would have protested against the public issue of <em>The Book of a Thousand
Nights and a Night</em>, and Mrs. Grundy would have had reason as well as propriety on
her side; but I must say that the tone of the work is singularly robust and healthy.
What a treasure-house Captain Burton has opened! Until he turned the key we knew
little or nothing of <cite>The Nights</cite>, the Villon Society’s issue notwithstanding, and the notes
which he has added to the work have a value which is simply unique.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Continental Times</cite>, <em>September 26th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">I have been favoured, if that is the right word to use, with a sight of Captain
Burton’s new translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. It is a sumptuous work, in an
exquisite binding of gold and black, with broad pages and fine large type, such an
edition as a scholar and a book lover finds after his own heart. Moreover, the translation
is a wonderful bit of English. Captain Burton has by a fanciful, but on the whole,
true impulse, chosen to tell the story in old English, not the English of Chaucer, but of
a sufficiently archaic type. The choice of an idiom which in some degree recalls the air
of the Canterbury Tales and the Decameron—to say nothing of Pantagruel and Panurge—softens
the grossness of some of the stories, and gives an additionally quaint charm to
the others. No one, however, will recognise at first sight the book of his childhood.
The solemn invocation of Allah on the first page, the spelling of Vizier as Wazir, and of
genie as Jinni, as well as the terrible frankness of some of the tales, all seem to transport
us into another land than that through which we floated on the “silken sale of infancy.”
On the whole, Captain Burton is right in strictly confining his work to the library and
the student. The reading of it by the public generally can only spoil an immortal work
for our boys and girls.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Montreal Daily Herald</cite>, <em>September 21st, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Captain Burton has translated the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, but will only publish it for
private distribution. A correspondent says that “all these years we have been reading
Lane’s turgid emasculated selections we have been kept in the dark as to their singular
beauty and vitally human strength. I have been amazed at the <cite>Nights</cite> as englished
by Captain Burton in strong, vital, picturesque prose. The stories, instead of being
pieces of wild extravagance, unreal and theatrically tinselly, with the limelight instead of
daylight, and paste instead of diamonds, are full of abounding life.”</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Bat</cite>, <em>September 29th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Captain Burton, in his way, renders a gigantic service to all students of literature
who are not profound Orientalists, and to many who are, by giving them a literal, honest,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_460">460</span>and accurate translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. * * * Some idiotic
persons here and there, and certain journals which have earned an infamous notoriety by
doing their best to deprave public morals, have raised a foolish clamour against Captain
Burton and his translation. Journalists, who had no objection to pandering to the worst
tastes of humanity at a penny a copy, are suddenly inspired by much righteous indignation
at a privately printed work which costs a guinea a volume, and in which the manners,
the customs, and the language of the East are boldly represented as they were and as
they are. Such critics Captain Burton, and the readers of Captain Burton’s translation,
can afford to despise and to ignore. <cite>The Arabian Nights Entertainment</cite> has been
the playbook of generations, the delight of the nursery and the school-room for nearly
two hundred years. Now it is high time that scholars and students should be allowed to
know what the Arabian Nights Entertainment really is. Lovers of Arabic have long
since known something of the truth concerning the Alif Laila. It need no Burton, it
needed no Payne, to tell the masters of Oriental languages that <em>The Thousand Nights
and a Night</em> was a very different thing from what either Galland or Lane had made it
out to be. Mr. Payne, in his way, rendered no slight service, Captain Burton, in his
way, renders a gigantic service to all students of literature who are not profound
Orientalists, and to many who are, by giving them a literal, honest, and accurate translation
of the ‘<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.’ * * * The blatant buffoons who have
spoken of Captain Burton’s work indifferently only show their own ignorance of the
literature of the East. Captain Burton’s work is well worth the price he charges for it to
students of Eastern literatures and Eastern manners, and Eastern customs; but the
misguided lunatic who invests in it in the hope of getting hold of a good thing, in the
Holywell Street sense of the term, will find indeed that the fool and his money are soon
parted.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Academy</cite>, <em>October 3rd, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As Capt. Richard F. Burton’s translation of <cite>The Thousand and One Nights</cite> is
likely for several reasons to awaken a literary controversy, the following letter from Mr.
John Addington Symonds in the <cite>Academy</cite> of October 3, will be read with interest. The
subject upon which it touches is an important one, and one which must be regarded from
a scholarly as well as a moral point of view. Mr. Symonds writes like the scholar that he
is; we shall soon see how the moralists write, and if they say anything to the point we
shall copy it:—</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite"><span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Am Hof, Davos Platz</span></cite>, Switzerland, <em>September 27th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c016">“There is an outcry in some quarters against Capt. Burton’s translation of the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. Only one volume of the work has reached me, and I have not as yet
read the whole of it. Of the translator’s notes I will not speak, the present sample being
clearly insufficient to judge by; but I wish to record a protest against the hypocrisy which
condemns his text. When we invite our youth to read an unexpurgated Bible (in Hebrew
and Greek, or in the authorised version), an unexpurgated Aristophanes, an unexpurgated
Juvenal, an unexpurgated Boccaccio, an unexpurgated Rabelais, an unexpurgated collection
of Elizabethan dramatists, including Shakespeare, and an unexpurgated Plato (in
Greek or in Prof. Jowett’s English version), it is surely inconsistent to exclude the unexpurgated
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> whether in the original or in any English version, from the
studies of a nation who rule India and administer Egypt.</p>

<p class="c012">“The qualities of Capt. Burton’s translation are similar to those of his previous
literary works, and the defects of those qualities are also similar. Commanding a vast
and miscellaneous vocabulary, he takes such pleasure in the use of it that sometimes he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_461">461</span>transgresses the unwritten laws of artistic harmony. From the point of view of language,
I hold that he is too eager to seize the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mot propre</span></i> of his author, and to render that by
any equivalent which comes to hand from field or fallow, waste or warren, hill or hedgerow,
in our vernacular. Therefore, as I think, we find some coarse passages of the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> rendered with unnecessary crudity, and some poetic passages marred by
archaisms and provincialisms. But I am at a loss to perceive how Burton’s method of
translation should be less applicable to the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> than to the <cite>Lusiad</cite>. So far
as, I can judge, it is better suited to the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïveté</span></i> combined with stylistic subtlety of the
former than to the smooth humanistic elegancies of the latter.</p>

<p class="c012">“This, however, is a minor point. The real question is whether a word for word
version of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, executed with peculiar literary vigor, exact scholarship, and
rare insight into Oriental modes of thought and feeling, can under any shadow of pretence be
classed with ‘the garbage of the brothels.’ In the lack of lucidity, which is supposed
to distinguish English folk, our middle-class <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">censores morum</span></i> strain at the gnat of a
privately circulated translation of an Arabic classic, while they daily swallow the camel
of higher education based upon minute study of Greek and Latin literature. When
English versions of Theocritus and Ovid, of Plato’s <cite>Phaedrus</cite> and the <cite>Ecclesiazusae</cite>, now
within the reach of every school-boy, have been suppressed, then and not till then can a
“plain and literal” rendering of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> be denied with any colour of consistency
to adult readers. I am far from saying that there are not valid reasons for thus
dealing with Hellenic and Graeco-Roman and Oriental literature in its totality. But let
folk reckon what Anglo-Saxon Puritanism logically involves. If they desire an Anglo-Saxon
Index Librorum Prohibitorum, let them equitably and consistently apply their
principles of inquisitorial scrutiny to every branch of human culture.</p>

<p class="c000">Everything comes to him who waits—even the long-promised, eagerly-expected
“Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights,” by Richard F. Burton. It is a
whole quarter of a century since this translation of one of the most famous books of the
world was contemplated, and we are told it is the natural outcome of the well-known
Pilgrimage to Medinah and Mecca. Of Captain Burton’s fitness for the task who can
doubt. It was during that celebrated journey to the tomb of the Prophet that he
proved himself to be an Arab—indeed, he says, in a previous state of existence he was
a Bedouin. Did he not for months at a stretch lead the life of a Son of the Faithful,
eat, drink, sleep, dress, speak, pray like his brother devotees, the sharpest eyes failing to
pierce his disguise? He knows the ways of Eastern men—and women—as he does the
society of London or Trieste. How completely at home he is with his adopted brethren
he showed at Cairo, when, to the amazement of some English friends who were looking
on at the noisy devotions of some “howling” Dervishes, he suddenly joined the
shouting, gesticulating circle, and behaved as if to the manner born. He has qualified as
a “Howler,” he holds a diploma as a master Dervish (see vol. iii. of his “Pilgrimage”),
and he can initiate disciples. Clearly, to use a phrase of Arabian story, it was decreed
by Allah from the beginning, and fate and fortune have arranged, that Captain Burton
should be the one of all others to confer upon his countrymen the boon of the genuine
unsophisticated <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>. In the whole of our literature no
book is more widely known. It is spread broadcast like the Bible, Bunyan and Shakespeare;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_462">462</span>yet although it is in every house, and every soul in the kingdom knows something
about it, yet nobody knows it as it really exists. We have only had what translators
have chosen to give—selected, diluted and abridged transcripts. And of late some
so-called “original” books have been published containing minor tales purloined bodily
from the <cite>Nights</cite>. There have been many versions, beginning with the beautiful
Augustan French example of Professor Galland, but all have failed, or rather no one
has attempted, to reproduce the great Oriental masterpiece. Judged by the number of
editions—a most fallacious test of merit—Lane’s three volumes, on the whole, have
found greatest favour with the British public. He was too timid to give to the world
the full benefit of his studies, and he kept a drawing-room audience in view. He was
careful to adapt his picture to the English standard of propriety, and his suppressions
and omissions are on a wholesale scale. Lord Byron said of English novelists that they
give a full length of courtship and but a bust of marriage. Mr. Lane thought it expedient
draw a tight veil, to tell only half the truth—in short he stops at the bust. Moreover
he destroyed all the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mécanique</span></i> of his original, and cruelly altered the form. He did
away with the charming and dramatic framework of the tales, turned the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
into the Arabian Chapters, and too often into the Arabian Notes. The first sole and
complete translation was furnished recently by Mr. John Payne, whose “Book of the
Thousand Nights and One Night” is dedicated to Captain Burton. Mr. Payne printed
500 copies for private circulation, a mere drop in the ocean. His edition was instantly
absorbed, clutched with avidity, and is unprocurable—unless, as has happened several
times, a stray copy finds its way into the market, and is snatched up at a fancy price.
It so happened that Mr. Payne and Captain Burton applied themselves to the same
task quite unconscious of each other’s labour. They were running on the same rails like
Adams and Leverrier, the joint discoverers of Neptune, or like Darwin and Wallace,
who simultaneously evolved the theory of Natural Selection. Hearing of a competitor,
Captain Burton, who was travelling to the Gold Coast, he freely offered his fellow
worker precedence. Mr. Payne’s production served to whet curiosity, and the young
scholars of the day applied themselves to Arabic in order to equip their minds, and to
be in a more blissful state of preparation for the triumphant edition to follow. Captain
Burton’s first volume in sombre black and dazzling gold—the livery of the Abbasides—made
its appearance three weeks ago, and divided attention with the newly-discovered
Star. It is the first volume of ten, the set issued solely to subscribers. And already,
as in the case of Mr. Payne’s edition, there has been a scramble to secure it, and it is no
longer to be had for love or money. The fact is, it fills a void, the world has been
waiting for this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chef d’œuvre</span></i>, and all lovers of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> wonder how they
have got on without it. We must break off from remarks to give some idea of the
originality of the style, of the incomparable way in which the very essence and life of
the East is breathed into simple straightforward Anglo-Saxon English. In certain of
Captain Burton’s books he borrows words from all languages, there are not enough for
his use, and he is driven to coin them. But in the character of Arabian story-teller he is
simplicity itself, and whilst avoiding words of length, he introduces just enough of antique
phrase as gives a bygone and poetic flavour. The most exacting and the most fastidious
will be satisfied at the felicitous handling of immortal themes. A delightful characteristic
is the division of the text into Nights. Lane and Payne, for peculiar reasons of their
own, have both omitted to mark the breaks in the recital. But now for the first time
the thread on which all is strung is clearly kept in view, and justice is done to the long
drawn out episode of the young wife who saves her own neck and averts a wholesale
massacre of maidens by her round of stories within stories. This is how Shahrazad
begins her discourses:—</p>

<p class="c000">“But when it was midnight Shahrazad awoke and signalled to her sister Dunyazad,
who sat up and said, ’Allah upon thee, O my sister, recite to us some new story, delightsome
<span class="pageno" id="Page_463">463</span>and delectable, wherewith to while away the waking hours of our latter night.’
‘With joy and goodly gree,’ answered Shahrazad, ‘if this pious and auspicious King
permit me.’ ‘Tell on,’ quoth the King, who chanced to be sleepless and restless, and
therefore was pleased with the prospect of hearing her story. So Shahrazad rejoiced;
and thus on the first night of the Thousand Nights and a Night, she began with the</p>

<h4 class="c030">TALE OF THE TRADER AND THE JINNI.”</h4>

<p class="c027">“It is related, O auspicious King, that there was a merchant of the merchants who
had much wealth and business in various cities. Now on a day he mounted horse and
went forth to recover monies in certain towns, and the heat sore oppressed him; so he
sat beneath a tree, and putting his hand into his saddle-bags, took thence some broken
bread and dry dates and began to break his fast.”</p>

<p class="c000">The recital proceeds until</p>

<p class="c000">“Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister to her, ‘How fair is thy tale, and how grateful, and how sweet and how
tasteful!’ And Shahrazad answered her, ‘What is this to that I could tell thee on the
coming night were I to live and the King would spare me?’ Then said the King in
himself, ’By Allah, I will not slay her until I have heard the rest of her tale.’ Then
the King went forth to his audience-hall, and the Wazir went with his daughter’s shroud
under his arm. The King issued his orders, and promoted this and deposed that, until
the end of the day; and he told the Wazir no whit of what had happened. But the
Minister wondered thereat with exceeding wonder; and when the Court broke up King
Shahryar entered his palace.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">said Dunyazad to her sister Shahrazad, ‘O my sister, finish for us that story of the
Merchant and the Jinni;’ and she answered, ‘With joy and goodly gree, if the King
permit me.’”</p>

<p class="c000">The first volume takes us through the mazes of the stories included in the Tales of
“The Trader and the Jinni,” “The Fisherman and the Jinni,” “The Porter and the
Three Ladies of Baghdad,” “The Tale of the Three Apples,” “The Tale of Nur Al-Din
Ali and his Son Badr Al-Din Hassan,” and “The Hunchback’s Tale.” The reader
most familiar with the ordinary versions at once is in a new atmosphere. The novelty is
startling as it is delightful. We are face to face with the veritable East, where Cairo,
Damascus, and Baghdad are known to us as London or Lincoln. The whole life of the
people is represented, nothing is passed over or omitted. The picture is complete, and
contains everything as the “white contains the black of the eye,” a phrase which, by-the-bye,
in Arabic is all contained in one word. We have before alluded to the strength
and beauty of the style. The felicities of expression are innumerable. What could be
better than the terms to express grief and joy, “his breast broadened,” “his breast
straitened,” or the words used of a person in abject terror, “I died in my skin,” or the
cruelty of the scourger who persevered “till her forearm failed,” or the expression of
despair “The light before his face became night,” or the grand account of the desert
storm “when behold a dust cloud up-flew and grew until <em>it walled the horizon from view</em>.”
Another speciality of Captain Burton’s edition is the Notes. He is celebrated for sowing
the bottom of his pages with curiously illuminating remarks, and he has here carried out
his custom in a way to astonish. He tells us that those who peruse his notes in addition
to those of Lane would be complete proficients in the knowledge of Oriental practices
and customs. Lane begins with Islam from Creation to the present day, and has
deservedly won for his Notes the honour of a separate reprint. Captain Burton’s object
in his annotations is to treat of subjects which are completely concealed from the multitude.
They are utterly and entirely esoteric, and deal with matters of which books
<span class="pageno" id="Page_464">464</span>usually are kept clear. Indeed he has been assured by an Indian officer who had been
40 years in the East, that he was entirely ignorant of the matters revealed in these Notes.
Without these marvellous elucidations the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> would remain only half
understood, but by their aid we may know as much of the Moslems as the Moslems
know of themselves.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Lincoln Gazette</cite>, <em>October 17</em>.—No. 2.<br /> <span class="sc">Second Notice.</span></h3>

<p class="c027">In bringing out his <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> Captain Burton has made a bold attempt to dispense
with the middleman the publisher. He has gone straight to the printer, he
himself undertaking the business of distribution. It is time somebody should be energetic.
With curious submission authors go on bearing their grievances, and sow that
others may reap. Whole editions of travels are issued, and the person most concerned,
the author, gets a pittance of £5. And only the other day Walt Whitman, most illustrious
of American poets, and in the opinion of capable judges the most illustrious man
of letters across the Atlantic, publicly announced that the profits on his writings for
a whole year amounted to a few dollars. Captain Burton has broken through the
bondage, and the result promises to be highly satisfactory. But he has been threatened
with pains and penalties; one trade journal, the <cite>Printing Times and Lithographer</cite>,
under the immediate direction of an eminent bookseller, known for his
vast purchases of rare publications, announced that <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite> would be
suppressed unless its tone and morals were unexceptionable! In short, publishers are
exasperated, and, like the Peers, they do not see the force of being abolished. The
authors, however, who sigh to be independent, must not take it for granted that the
experiment is easy, or likely to be often successful. In this particular instance it is a case
of <em>the</em> Man and <em>the</em> Book. There is only one <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> in the world, and only
one Captain Burton. The general tone of the London press has been distinctly favourable,
the <cite>Standard</cite> leading the way and other journals following suit. The <cite>Pall Mall</cite>
made an effort to lodge the author in Bow Street, with its “Chief Director,” but it has
likewise had the fairness to give both sides of the question, and whilst attacking on its
own account, to admit letters and articles in defence of a genuine and unsophisticated
translation. As we have said [in our notice of last week] Captain Burton has been
explicit on the point that his edition is by no means intended for the circulating library.
It is mainly for scholars, for students whose tastes lead them Eastwards, and last, but
not least, it is intended as a guide for our rulers and statesmen. England, we are
reminded, “the greatest Mohammedan empire in the world,” neglects Arabism, and
discourages it in examinations for the Indian Civil Service, “hence, when suddenly
compelled to assume the reins of Government in Moslem lands, as Afghanistan in times
past, and Egypt at present, she fails after a fashion which scandalises her few friends;
and her crass ignorance concerning the Oriental peoples which should most interest her
exposes her to the contempt of Europe as well as of the Eastern world. The deadly
blunders we commit through ignorance are brought out in the one fact, that with the English
army in Suakim, during the troubles of 1883–84, not an English official in camp, after
the death of the gallant and lamented Major Morice, was capable of speaking Arabic.”
<cite>The Thousand Nights and a Night</cite> offers a complete picture of Eastern peoples.
But the English reader must be prepared to find that the manners of Arabs and Moslems
differ from his own. Eastern people look at things from a more natural and primitive
point of view, and they say what they think with all the unrestraint of children. At
times their plain speaking is formidable, but they are not conscious of impropriety, and
their coarseness is not intentional. It is their nature to be downright, and to be communicative
on subjects about which the Saxon is shy or silent, and it must be remembered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_465">465</span>that the separation of the sexes adds considerably to this freedom of expression.
Their language is material in quality, every root is objective; as an instance, for the
word <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soul</span></i> they have no more spiritual equivalent than <em>breath</em>. Even the conversation
between parents and children is of incredible frankness, and the Wazir of Egypt talks
to his daughter, “the Lady of Beauty,” in a fashion astonishing to the West. But the
Arabs are a great mixture. They are keenly alive to beauty, and every youth and
every damsel is described in glowing, rapturous terms. We have heard in our own
country, so far north as chilly Scotland, of a whole audience standing up in a theatre to
applaud the entrance and acknowledge the charms of a beautiful woman. In the East
they are far more readily subjugated, and the event is of every-day occurrence, and not a
wonder. “When the people of Damascus saw Ajib’s beauty and brilliancy and perfect
grace and symmetry (for he was a marvel of comeliness and winning loveliness, softer
than the cool breeze of the North, sweeter than limpid waters to man in drouth, and
pleasanter than the health for which sick man sueth) a mighty many followed him, whilst
others ran on before and sat down on the road until he should come up, that they might
gaze on him.” The Arabs are highly imaginative, and their world is peopled with
supernatural beings, whilst Ovid is surpassed in the number and ingenuity of their metamorphoses.
Their nerves are highly strung, they are emotional to the hysteric degree,
and they do everything in the superlative fashion. They love at first sight, and one
glimpse of a face is enough to set them in flames; they cease to sleep or to eat until
they are admitted to the adored presence, they weep till they faint, they rend their
garments, pluck their beards, buffet their faces, and after paroxysms of passion they
recover sufficiently to recite verses—“and he beat his face and head and recited these
couplets”—“then she recited, weeping bitterly the while”—“When the young man
heard these words he wept with sore weeping, till his bosom was drenched with
tears, and began reciting.” All this effervescence, so different to our rigid repression,
all this exuberance of feeling is the gift of a hot climate. And, besides this easy
stirring of their passions, they always live in supreme consciousness that every impulse,
every act is decreed, that they drift without will of their own, and are the helpless
creatures of destiny. Half their talk consists of invocations to Allah, the All-ruling,
All-gracious Allah! This fatalistic element is a leading feature in the <cite>Nights</cite>. All that
happens is accepted with submission, and with the conviction that nothing can be
averted. The Wazir’s eye is knocked out, “as fate and fortune decreed,” the one
pomegranate seed escapes destruction, and the Princess dies in consequence; the beautiful
lad secreted in a cave <em>under the earth</em> to keep him from harm, because it is foretold
by the astrologers that he will die on a certain day, meets with his death at the
appointed hour despite all precautions. This is one of the myriad instances, says
Captain Burton, showing “that the decrees of Anagké, Fate, Destiny, Weird are
inevitable.” And yet, in the face of overwhelming evidence that Moslems in all things
bow to the stroke of destiny, it is singular to note that a Turkish scholar like Mr. Redhouse,
translator of the “Mesnevi,” fails to realise this most characteristic trait of
Mahometan belief, and confuses it with the Christian idea of Providence and Premonition.
The folk in Arabian tales, as might be expected, meet calamity in the shape of
death with fortitude. The end of life is not a terror acutely feared as with us. They
die easily, and when the time comes they give up the ghost without repining,
although the mourning by survivors is often loud and vehement, and sometimes
desperately prolonged. This facility in dying is partly due to their fatalistic philosophy,
and partly it is the effect of climate. It is in rugged climes that death is appalling,
and comes as the King of Terrors, but the hotter the country the easier it is to enter the
Door of Darkness. All these things which make the difference between Orientals and
ourselves must be taken into account by readers of Arabian story, and the coarseness, as
Captain Burton shows, “is but the shade of a picture which otherwise would be all light;”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_466">466</span>the general tone of the Nights “is exceptionally high and pure, and the devotional fervour
often rises to boiling point.” We have shown how Captain Burton has rendered the
prose of the Nights, how vigorous, yet simple, is the language, how pleasant is his use
of antique phrase, serving as it often does to soften the crudity of Oriental expression.
In translating the poetry, which finally will amount to nearly 10,000 lines, he has again
started on a path of his own. He has closely preserved the Arab form, although, as he
says, an absolutely exact copy of Arabic metres is an impossibility. Like the prose, the
verse belongs to three separate epochs. In the prose there are two sets of apologues
or beast-fables, which may date from any remote age, one having been found on an
Egyptian papyrus; we have next the fairy tales, and these were borrowed from the
Persians, whose marvellous poetic old Guebres, who gave to Islamism everything it has
which breathes of spiritualism or romance; and we have the histories whose proper
names, such as Harun al-Rashid, with that of his Wazir, Ja’afar, give the dates. And
so with the poetry. Here and there we have some grand old fragment of pre-Islamitic
verse taken from the Hamásah anthology or from the “Suspended Poems;” but more
common are the quotations from Abou Nowas, Amaí, and other singers of the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">décadence</span></i>
who were the ornaments of Harun al-Rashid’s court: and lastly, there are the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces de
occasion</span></i>, the copies of verses made by the writer or writers of the Nights, and as a rule
these are mere doggerel. When the story is a love story the poetry is abundant, the
agitated youths and damsels bandying verses to express the intensity of their emotions.
Some tales are nearly half verse, and then when we get into parts where the sentiment is less
exalted, where the recitals are mixed with humorous touches, such as in the “Hunchback’s
Tale,” or “The Barber’s Tale of Himself,” or “The Tale of the Tailor,” we
have pages of nearly unbroken prose. A striking novelty in Captain Burton’s translation
is the frequent occurrence of passages in cadenced prose, called in Arabic “Saj’a,”
or the cooing of a dove. These melodious fragments have a charming effect on the ear.
They come as dulcet-surprises, and mostly occur in highly-wrought situations; or they
are used to convey a vivid sense of something exquisite in art or nature. We give one
or two instances of these little eddies of song set like gems in the prose. Their introduction
seems due to whim or caprice, but really is due to profound study of the situation as
if the tale-teller felt suddenly compelled to break into the rhythmic strain. The prose
ripples and rises to dancing measure when the King of the Age, wandering in a lonely
palace, comes upon the half-petrified youth, “the Ensorcelled Prince.”</p>

<p class="c000">“Now when the Sultan heard the mournful voice he sprang to his feet, and following
the sound found a curtain let down over the chamber door. He raised it and saw behind
it a young man sitting upon a couch about a cubit above the ground: he fair to the sight
a well-shaped wight, with eloquence dight, his forehead was flower-white, his cheek rosy
bright, and a mole on his cheek breadth like an ambergris mite.”</p>

<p class="c000">It is broken again to bring into fuller notice the perfections of one of the three merry
ladies of Baghdad, sitting under a silken canopy, the curtains “looped up with pearls as
big as filberts and bigger.” We are told to note how eastern are the metaphors, how
confused the flattery.</p>

<p class="c000">“Thereupon sat a lady bright of blee, with brow-beaming brilliancy, and her eyebrows
were arched as for archery; her breath breathed ambergris and perfumery, and her lips
were sugar to taste and carnelian to see. Her stature was straight as the letter I (the
letter Alif a straight perpendicular stroke), and her face shamed the noon sun’s radiancy;
and she was even as a galaxy or a dome with golden marquetry, or a bride displayed on
choicest finery, or a noble maid of Araby.”</p>

<p class="c000">And prose is not thought adequate to do justice to the natural beauty of a garden
“like one of the pleasaunces of Paradise.”</p>

<p class="c000">“It was a garden with trees of freshest green and ripe fruits of yellow sheen; and
its birds were singing clear and keen, and rills ran wimpling through the fair terrene.”</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_467">467</span>It is a marvel that these cadences have never been reproduced before. They have
been faintly attempted by Eastwick, in his “Gulistan,” whilst Mr. Payne simply passed
them over, rejected them as of no account. They fall in with Captain Burton’s plan of
omitting nothing; of giving the <cite>Nights</cite> intact in the precise form in which they are
enjoyed by the Oriental. Beside the verses so characteristic of exaggerated Arabic sentiment,
and the rhymed cadences, let like precious stones into the gold of the prose, the
proverbs embodying the proverbial wit and wisdom, are all rhymed as in the original
Arabic. What Arabists think of this translation we may learn from a professed Arabist
writing to this effect:—“I am free to confess, after many years study of Arabic, a comparison
of your translation with the text has taught me more than many months of dry
study,” whilst Englishmen who for years have lived in the East, are making the discovery
that, after all, they have known little or nothing, and their education is only beginning
with this version of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. It is only knowledge that knows how to
observe; and it is satisfactory to observe that Captain Burton’s amazing insight into
Eastern peculiarities has been put to its best use in giving a true idea of the People of
the Sun and a veritable version of their Book of Books. The labour expended on this
edition has been enormous. The work could only have been completed by the most excessive
and pertinacious application. All the same we are told it has been “a labour of love,”
a task that has brought its own exceeding great reward. There is only one regret, the
circulation is bound to be limited. We cannot help hoping, at some future time, a selection
may be made from the ten volumes, and even as they now stand many of the stories
could be read aloud. If the public cannot have the whole work, at least it might have a
part, and not be shut out from a masterpiece unparalleled.</p>

<p class="c027">Sir Richard Burton’s version of the <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>, privately
printed for the use of men and scholars, is now unobtainable. The edition sold off immediately,
and the price has already reached twenty-six guineas. The best critics among
the thousand purchasers say that the language is wonderful, the words graceful, the
rendering of thought, as well as words, most accurate, and the poetry marvellous. The
Oriental purchasers say that the language is wonderful, and they declare that they have
learnt more orientalism in the volumes than by long years of study.</p>

<p class="c027">Some time since I had occasion to speak out energetically about this same work,
thinking that a book which, though running only to a small edition, might from its general
interest excite the curiosity of those who saw copies of it, and that, within its luxurious
covers, matters of prurient crudity might meet the prying eyes of those whom we would
guard against such knowledge. * * * Of the vigorous and poetic English of Captain

<p class="c027">There is a charm and fascination about Burton’s translation that enchains the reader.

the resplendent Orient can produce.</p>

expurgated edition of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> from the pen of Captain Burton, now a
similar act of Vandalism to that book of our boyhood, <cite>Robinson Crusoe</cite>. What there
was in the pages of the immortal work of Defoe, to which even the most susceptible could
take exception, is one of those things known only to the Society for the Promotion of

<p class="c027">Whatever reason there may have been for limiting to the number of a thousand copies
the original translation by Captain Sir Richard F. Burton, his literally correct, complete,
and beautiful version of the <cite>Arabian Nights, The Thousand Nights and One Night</cite>
tales—a work of prodigious erudition and mastery of Oriental language, literature,
manners, and customs—we cannot but think it was a pity to have placed exclusively
within the reach of the select, opulent, scholarly, and fastidious few that which would
have been a delight and joy for ever to the less favoured of fortune—the countless
millions. The “<cite>Arabian Nights Entertainments</cite>” even in the imperfect, garbled,
second-hand version which has been current in England for a hundred and eighty years
through the French paraphrase by Professor Galland, has been read by all classes, high
and low, with admiration of the wonderful invention, marvellous adventures, oriental
imagery, charming dramatic scenes, exquisite poetry, varied pictures of Eastern life and
habits—with all which the collection abounds. Why, then, when a genuine translation,
the work of many years, has been completed by a matchless Arab scholar, traveller, and
linguist is perfected, should it be withheld from the multitude, and reserved for the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_469">469</span>delectation of the learned and the rich. We are of opinion that the Arabian Tales,
which are so universally pleasing to the people, should not be withheld from them, as they
would be practically if shut up in glass cases, among the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">éditions de luxe</span></i> of connoisseurs.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Fun</cite>, <em>November 2nd, 1886</em>.<br /> <cite class="scite">New Leaves.</cite></h3>

<p class="c027">Apart from the learning and labour so lavishly bestowed upon the original edition,
there is ever a charm of seeming enchantment surrounding these wondrous stories, which
age does not abate, nor time destroy—yet the truthfulness of this translation enriches and
enhances them.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Eastern Daily Press</cite>, <em>November 13th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">I think I should like to shake the curators of the Bodleian library. Last September
Sir Richard Burton applied to them through Dr. Rost, the chief librarian at the India
Office, for leave to have a MS. of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> transferred from the Bodleian to
the India Office under the custody of Dr. Rost. The request was a perfectly regular and
usual one, and in Sir Richard Burton’s case it was accompanied by a distinct promise
that no “indelicate or immoral” tale should be translated. There was therefore no
fear that the peculiar frankness which characterised Sir Richard’s renderings of previous
tales would be repeated. A month—six weeks—passed without a reply from the curators,
the fact being that they had met twice without being able to get the necessary quorum of
three, and once again without doing anything at all. Then Sir Richard Burton got
curt note informing him that at the fourth meeting the majority of the curators were
unwilling to lend the MS. At the same meeting they allowed sundry MSS. to be sent
to the India Office. Now this not only implies a gross neglect of duty, but it is a wanton
insult to a man who, after all, is one of the most distinguished Orientalists of his day.
Burton’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, disfigured as they are by the indelicacy of the original, are a
masterpiece of idiomatic translation; and as a purely literary work must rank very high
indeed. Moreover, the shadow of an excuse for the curator’s conduct disappeared after
Sir Richard’s pledge to keep within the lines of strict propriety. After all, learned men
have a sad tendency to degenerate into meddling old women.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">County Gentleman</cite>, <em>November 27th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Sir Richard Burton’s work has been criticised in some quarters for a too obvious
straining after the literal reproduction of the original. In our opinion, such a course
deserves rather praise than censure. And, indeed, we would demur to the phrase
“obvious straining” in connection with the great Orientalist and explorer’s wonderfully
successful representation to English eyes and ears of both the meaning and the form of
this marvellous mosaic of Eastern fancy and imagination. That certain words and
phrases Sir Richard makes use of are unfamiliar to the British reader is perfectly true.
But it must be remembered that they have been made the means of rendering intelligible
unfamiliar modes of thought and feeling which are entirely beyond the reach of smug
literary conventions and forms of expression. For ourselves, we can honestly say that
these very outrages upon Philistine sensibility have been amongst the principal charms
of this unequal and unrivalled translation—adding vastly to the vicissitudes and seeming
fidelity of the work. The marvel to us has been rather—remarking the uniformly level
execution of the whole—that so few verbal ingenuities of the kind referred to have been
<span class="pageno" id="Page_470">470</span>found necessary, and that so much of the translated prose is English undefiled, albeit of
the vigorous and vertebrate order, and so much of the translated poetry has the ring of
genuine English verse. We might, however, write pages in explanation of our view of
the manner in which Sir Richard has discharged his task without approaching his
definition of his work as “a faithful copy of the great Eastern Saga-book by preserving
intact not only the spirit, but even the méchanique, the manner, and the matter.” Of
the tales themselves, we can, of course, say nothing true that is new, or nothing new
that is also true. No romances of intrigue and adventure, of wealth and poverty, of
luxury and love, have had such universal acceptance, or received so much of that homage
which is said to be the sincerest—the flattery of imitation. And this by means of the
garbled and imperfect versions which have hitherto obtained currency in the Western
world.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Philadelphia</cite>, <em>December 12th, 1887</em>.<br /> <span class="sc">Once More in Print.</span></h3>

<p class="c027">Sir Richard F. Burton is once more in print. * * * * He has some
two or three years to serve as Consul at Trieste before he is entitled to a retiring
pension, and it is a grievance with the friends and admirers of “the Arabian
Knight” that the government does not do a generous thing—that is, “retire”
and pension him at once. There is no doubt that the prospects of a prolonged
life would be strengthened if he could retire from the Consulate and fix his own
dwelling place. And his literary career is by no means at an end. The third
volume of “The Supplemental Nights” is to-day in the hands of the subscribers. Like
all its predecessors, it contains a characteristic dedication. Thus: “To Henry Edward
John, Lord Stanley of Alderly, this the most innocent volume of <cite>The Nights</cite> is inscribed
by his old companion, the Author.” It would appear from the Foreword that Sir Richard
Burton has had some difficulty with his work. He has reckoned without his host. He
says: “The peculiar proceedings of the curators, Bodleian Library, Oxford, of which
full particulars will be given in due time, have dislocated the order of my volumes. The
prospectus had promised that Tome III. should contain detached extracts from the MS.
known as the Wortley-Montague, and that No. IV. and part of No. V. should comprise
a reproduction of the ten Tales (or eleven, including ‘The Princess of Daryabar’), which
have so long generally been attributed to Professor Galland. Circumstances, however,
wholly beyond my control, have now compelled me to devote the whole of this volume to
the Frenchman’s stories.” What has happened? Has Sir Richard Burton’s Devils (I use
the word in its legal sense) been refused permission to translate? His vials of wrath will
be filled to overflowing if that sort of opposition accumulates. Already we are promised
a reckoning with the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>. Well may the translator of <cite>The Nights</cite> be
spared to deal out his “smashing blow” with characteristic vigour. He is like the late
Charles Reade in this—he is never so entertaining, to the onlooker, as when he goes
tooth and nail for an antagonist. The reader has no cause to complain of the dislocation
of the author’s plans. Two of the most famous of the supplemental tales are given in the
volume in question making it uncommonly bulky and investing it with special interest.
The account of how the originals of these came into his possession is remarkable, but it is
too long for citation. The two tales to which I refer are “Alaeddin, or the Wonderful
Lamp,” and “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.” More disillusion. It is no longer
Aladdin, but Alaeddin. It is not “Open sesame,” but “Open O simsin” and “Shut,
O simsin” in the Forty Thieves. I dare say there are many other departures from the
text of the stories which we have known from our childhood. In Sir Richard Burton’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_471">471</span>version “Alaeddin” opens in this wise: “There dwelt in a city of the cities of China a
man which was a tailor, withal a pauper, and he had one son, Alaeddin, hight. Now,
this boy had been from his babyhood a ne’er-do-well, a scapegrace; and when he had
reached his tenth year,” &amp;c. “The Forty Thieves” opens differently. “In days of yore
and in times long gone before there dwelt in a certain town of Persia two brothers, one
named Kásim and the other Alí Bábá, who at their father’s demise had divided the little
wealth he had left to them with equitable division, and had lost no time in wasting and
spending it all.”</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Academy</cite>, <em>December 11th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Knowing his profound Oriental scholarship, and amazing gift of tongues, and the
vast range of his reading, one could not have doubted that Sir Richard Burton’s translation
would be a noteworthy performance; but none, I imagine, were prepared for the
fine force and old-world flavour of the style which he has forged for himself on this
occasion, or for the extraordinary richness, variety, and quaintness of his vocabulary.
Not only has he with characteristic masterfulness pressed into his service any and every
word, English or foreign, current or obsolete, that suited his fancy or answered to the
need of the moment, but he has not scrupled to coin the lacking epithet when wanted.
Thus, the ape-prince is “ensorcelled;” a merchant who sells perfumes and drugs is
“a perfumer-cum-druggist;” an aged man “long o’ beard,” is an “oldster;” two
warriors “fall to derring-do of cut and thrust;” the Jinniyah of Bassora flies “firmamentwise;”
Prince Ajib goes to sea with a fleet of “ten keel;” our old acquaintance the
Hunchbacked Groom is a “Gobbo” and an “accursed carle;” one of the ladies of
Baghdad wears a “mantilla;” Ja’afar the prudent minister of Harun al-Rashid, hesitates
not to propose in good Scottish dialect that “each and every one of us gang his own
gait;” and the porter refuses to “stump it” till he has heard the stories of the three
“monoculars,” better known as the three one-eyed Kalendars, who were sons of kings.
These are but a few examples taken hastily and at random; but they serve to show the
curious mosaic-work of the style. “Ensorcelled,” englished from the French, is
certainly ben trovato; “derring-do” is pure Spenserian; “keel” in the sense of ships,
though surviving at Newcastle-on-Tyne as the name of a carrying boat, has scarcely been
in literary use since the days of Verstagen and Surrey; “Gobbo” is Italian, and the
porter’s refusal has a distinct Transatlantic flavour.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Lincoln Gazette</cite>, <em>December 18th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Few people know anything of the trouble and the travelling which Sir Richard
Burton has undertaken in the accomplishment of his tremendous task. He has ransacked
all the libraries of the east and west, and has often undertaken a roving but idle quest
in the hope of throwing clearer light on a single disputed passage. His profound
acquaintance with Oriental languages and literature is shown at every turn, and, preserving
the romantic colouring of the original in a poetic rhythm of expression, he has
cast his finished version in a form which is singularly picturesque. While he has wisely
discarded the affected purisms under which inferior scholars love to shelter their
incompetency, he does not disfigure his pages with gratuitous accents, and he manfully
indulges our fond reminiscences of old friends by calling the Caliph the Caliph. Nor is
it any fault of his that we miss some of our favourites from his edition, such as Cogia
Hassan of the matchless diamonds and Aladdin of the marvellous lamp; for we believe
that they were spurious, though wonderfully attractive, and either sprung or took new
shape in the fertile fancy of that accomplished and brilliant Frenchman, M. Galland. * * *
<span class="pageno" id="Page_472">472</span>Still another speciality in this most complete of all Translations is the
versical portion, amounting to 10,000 lines. The Arab folk break into verse, “drop
into poetry,” on every occasion. When overcome by their feelings they weep and
recite verses, or they swoon first and on recovery pour forth couplets or poems of many
lines. Sometimes they improvise, or they quote their own Moores, Tennysons, and
Shelleys. The young Prince looks at the headsman who is ordered to slay him.
“I wept,” he says, “with exceeding weeping until I made him weep with me, and
looking at him I began to recite these couplets.” The sentimental stories are profusely
sprinkled with verse; one of the charming peculiarities of this form of utterance is its
inconsequence, the verses welling up from the depths of a despairing breast, often
having little or no relation to the circumstances of the moment. Mr. Lane gives a prose
paraphrase of a portion of the poems, but he omits verses right and left. We quote a
brief specimen from Lane and the same from Burton, and the reader will judge between
them.</p>

<p class="c000">The <cite>Nights</cite> without verses are like the day without sunshine. They are a
most important part of the work. They illustrate character and manners, and the
allusions, often remote and strange, require explanation, which is supplied in the shape

exaggeration, take the hospitable welcome of a lady, long hidden under ground, whose
solitude is suddenly broken by the arrival of a fair Prince.</p>

<p class="c000">“O youth, what sayest thou to wine?” and I answered, “Do as thou wilt.”

<p class="c000">If Sir Richard Burton has taken incredible pains with his “cooing cadence” and
his verses, and imparted to them their true eastern colour, his personages, his array of
characters, his sultans, his wazirs, princes, merchants, soldiers, slaves, his princesses,
concubines, houris, slave-girls, and old women, are simply alive and exhale the living
East—they are real as any creatures in Lincoln—to use Mr. Swinburne’s simile in his
Sonnet on this translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Weekly Dispatch</cite>, <em>November 14th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The curators of the Bodleian Library are determined to save morality from Sir
Richard Burton, so they have refused to let him see a manuscript of <cite>The Arabian
Nights</cite>, which he asked them to send to the India Office. Sir Richard has produced
some queer tales in his translations of Eastern fables; but as he gave a distinct promise
to the curators that nothing that transgressed propriety should be reproduced, their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_473">473</span>behaviour seems rather shabby. Lady Burton is publishing an expurgated edition of
her husband’s work for “household reading”; but no doubt the Bodleian curators will
forbid their daughters to look at it.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Gazette</cite>, <em>Saturday, December 18th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The most widely circulated translations of the <cite>Nights</cite>, the countless editions,
many of them illustrated, give no idea whatever of the true East, and are mere
burlesques of Galland’s French version. If only parents could distinguish between the
genuine and the spurious, these unsatisfactory imitations would cease to be acceptable,
and children in the nursery would be allowed to drink from the real fountain. It would
be quite as easy, and far better for the juveniles, to follow the story of an Ensorcelled
Prince, of a Magic Horse, or a Bottled Jinni, where the colour is all true, as it is to
swallow make-believe attempts of Eastern imagery. But a better time is coming for
children, and for children of a greater growth. To know the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> in all
their perfection, in all their gorgeous setting, in all their bewildered variety, and in all
their truth, we must look to the latest translator. For the last fifty years it is Lane’s
version that has held the field, and many people, not knowing there could be anything
better, accepted him as final. But, like the Horseman of Brass on the Horse of Brass
in the Sea of Peril, the time has come for dethronement, and Lane must yield to a
scholar of wider research, to an Orientalist who, during one part of his career, lived as a
veritable Moslem, and was indistinguishable from other Moslems. Lane’s idea was to
give but a portion of the <cite>Nights</cite>, to please himself and his printer and publisher as
to what should be selected, what omitted. If a story resembled another story, he
rejected it on the score that it might prove wearisome. For instance, he leaves out
“Nur al-Din and Miriam the Girdle Girl!”—despite its great historical interest as connected
with Charlemagne and his daughter—because it bears a family likeness to “Ali
Shar and Zamurrud;” and because he himself felt unsympathetic he altogether discards
the lively story of “Masrur and Zayn al-Mawásif,” a tale full of poetical merits with
lute scenes nowhere excelled, and with the most beautiful of all the many gardens in the
<cite>Nights</cite>. He passes over the truly Rabelaisian tale of “Ali the Persian and his marvellous
Carpet Bag;” he omits the chivalric story of “King Omar bin al-Nu’uman and
his Sons”—like cutting “Ivanhoe” out of “Waverley” novels—and for fear of ruffling
susceptibilities he suppresses “The Rogueries of Dalilah” and “Mercury Ali of Cairo,”
most characteristic of stories, full of fun, frisk and frolic and devilry, opening up new
ideas of Eastern human nature. These are but indications of Lane’s arbitrary method,
and people have submitted because quite unconscious they have been defrauded, and that
treasures have been withheld. At length, however, they have the entire and perfect
chrysolite. Sir Richard Burton does not pick and choose.</p>

<p class="c000">Various novelties distinguish the Burton edition. To begin with, a strict account
is kept of the separate nights, and the interest of the opening drama is sustained
throughout. On each individual Night of the whole Thousand and One we learn
exactly the amount and quality of incident related. The dramatic idea which binds the
whole sheaf of stories together is kept artistically in view. It is a peculiarity of the
stories that so many of them are told when the speaker is on the edge of doom—hardly
the moment for collected oration—and the story saves the story-teller’s life. The mighty
Ifrit who cuts off the hands and feet of his lady with four strokes, and then sends her
head flying, because he thinks she has betrayed him, is diverted from instant vengeance
on the suspected lover by the prospect of a story.</p>

<p class="c027">The first issue of Sir Richard Burton’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, limited to one thousand
copies, was quickly absorbed by scholars and linguists. It would have been a subject of
regret had so remarkable a work remained comparatively unknown. * * *
English versions of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> have hitherto chiefly represented them as
charming fairy tales. It remained to Sir R. Burton to fully accentuate their wider
meaning. In the translator’s words, their “pathos is sweet, deep and genuine, tender,
simple and true.”</p>

    <div><cite>THE REAL ARABIAN NIGHTS.</cite></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">To many familiar from childhood with “The Arabian Nights Entertainments,” it
has come as a shock to be told that the great work, in its true form, is nevertheless still
to them a sealed book; yet it would seem that the appearance of Sir Richard Burton’s
translation, but a few months ago, for the first time put within the reach of the English
public anything like a faithful reproduction of the original. Even this can hardly be
said to be given to the public. Only a thousand copies were published, and those at a
price that would have been prohibitory to the majority, if the issue had been unlimited.
Another obstacle to the general enjoyment of Sir Richard Burton’s translation was,
undoubtedly, the too faithful rendering of certain passages, specimens of “an exaggerated
mode of expressing thought” peculiar to Orientalists.</p>

<p class="c000">Numbers of English readers, to whom even the incomplete and bald versions hitherto
common amongst us have afforded many a delightful hour, on hearing of the Burton
edition have felt themselves almost mocked as they listened to its glowing praises, and
were told at the same time that it was for ever beyond their reach. Some would, perhaps,
rather have never heard of it, and have been left in happy ignorance of anything better
than they already had.</p>

<p class="c000">Now, however, all such lovers of the famous Oriental tales have consolation offered
them. Lady Burton, deeply sympathising with their disappointment, and anxious, too,
that her husband’s great labour, “a deep well of reading and knowledge,” should not
be wasted upon a few only, has come forward with an edition of her own which, while
preserving the beauty and value of the larger work, will be more accessible to general
readers, and, moreover, fitted for family use. The aim she has had in view in editing
has been to make as few omissions as possible, consistent with the latter requirement, on
which point Lady Burton observes: “I guarantee that no mother shall regret her girl’s
reading this <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.” We may say at once that, having carefully read a considerable
portion of this first volume, we think her guarantee quite made good. Of the
original 3,215 pages 215 only have been omitted. The translator’s “Foreword” tells
how the work came to be taken up, its system, and the conditions under which it was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_475">475</span>carried out, and its relation to other translations. Here is Sir R. Button’s own
account of</p>

<h4 class="c030"><span class="sc">The Object of this Version.</span></h4>

<p class="c027">“Briefly, the object of this version is to show what ‘The Thousand Nights and a
Night’ really is. Not, however, by straining <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">verbum reddere verbo</span></i>, but by writing as the
Arab would have written in English. My work claims to be a faithful copy of the great
Eastern Saga Book, by preserving intact not only the spirit, but even the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mécanique</span></i>, the
manner of the matter. Hence, however prosy and long-drawn out be the formula, it
retains the scheme of <cite>The Nights</cite>, because they are a prime feature in the original.
Moreover, holding that the translator’s glory is to add something to his native tongue,
while avoiding the hideous, hag-like nakedness of Torrens and the bald literalism of
Lane, I have carefully englished the picturesque turns and novel expressions of the
original in all their outlandishness; for instance, as when the dust-cloud raised by a
tramping host is described as ‘walling the horizon.’”</p>

<p class="c000">Although occasionally, perhaps, the formulæ may be a little too “long-drawn out,”
and some expressions too “outlandish” for the enjoyment of all, the reading is extremely
easy and pleasant. There is in it a charming movement and rhythm altogether absent
in the popular translations. Indeed, speaking of the translation as a whole, it is, as
compared with Scott’s or Lane’s, especially the former, as a poem to a paraphrase. The
very fulness of detail, far from wearying, so fills in the pictures before the mind that one
is inclined to linger over them with delight. To justly compare the several translations
one must place whole stories side by side. For this there is no space here; but perhaps
the comparison of a few brief extracts with Lane’s well-known translation will serve to
convey some idea of the greater beauty of Sir R. Burton’s. Dr. Scott’s version differs
so widely from either, and is so extremely scanty, that verbal comparison with it is almost
impossible. An idea of the scantiness may be formed from the fact that the matter comprised
in the tenth night, according to Burton and Lane, extends in Scott from the
thirty-first night to the thirty-sixth. The following passages are from the “Story of the
Porter and the Three Ladies of Baghdad”:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

    </div>
    <div class="group">

and to-morrow we will bring them before thee, and thou shalt ask them their story.’ But
the Khaleefeh refused to do so, and said, ‘I have not patience to wait so long for their
history.’—Words followed words, and at last they said, ‘Who shall put the question to
them?’—and one answered, ‘The Porter.’”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Burton.</em>—“Then he winked at the Caliph and whispered to him, ‘There is but one
hour of darkness left and I can bring them before thee to-morrow, when thou canst
freely question them all concerning their story.’ But the Caliph raised his head
haughtily, and cried out at him in wrath, saying, ‘I have no patience left for my longing
to hear of them; let the Kalendars question them forthright.’ Quoth Ja’afar,
‘This is not my counsel.’ Then words ran high and talk answered talk; and they disputed
as to who should first put the question, but at last all fixed upon the Porter.”</p>

      <div class="line"><em>Lane.</em>—“How good is it to pardon one able to resist! and how much more so one who is helpless!</div>

      <div class="line"><em>Burton.</em>—“How fair is ruth the strong man deigns not smother! And fairest fair when shown to weakest brother:</div>
      <div class="line">By love’s own holy tie between us twain, Let one not suffer for the sin of other.”</div>
      <div class="line">Here are four other examples of the difference of language between the two translations:—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><em>Lane.</em>—“A damsel of tall stature, high-bosomed, fair and beautiful, and of elegant
form, with a forehead like the bright new moon, eyes like those of gazelles, eyebrows
like the new moon of Ramadân, cheeks resembling anemones, and a mouth like the seal
of Suléyman, her countenance like the full moon in its splendour, and the forms of her
bosom resembled two pomegranates of equal size.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Burton.</em>—“A lady of tall figure, some five feet high; a model of beauty and loveliness,
brilliance, and symmetry, and perfect grace. Her forehead was flower-white;
her cheeks like the anemone, ruddy bright; her eyes were those of the wild heifer or
the gazelle, with eyebrows like the crescent moon, which ends Sha’aban and begins
Ramuzán; her mouth was the ring of Sulayman; her lips coral-red; her teeth like a
line of string pearls, or of camomile petals; and her throat recalled the antelope’s. In
fine, she was like her of whom the poet said,” &amp;c.</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Lane.</em>—“Was greatly surprised.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Burton.</em>—“Marvelled with exceeding wonder.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Lane.</em>—“Touched the chords with the ends of her fingers.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Burton.</em>—“Swept the strings with her finger-tips.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Lane.</em>—“We heard the sounds of drums and trumpets, warriors galloped about, and
the air was filled with dust raised by the horses’ hoofs.”</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Burton.</em>—“We heard the tom-toming of the kettle-drum and the tantara of trumpets,
and clash of cymbals; and the rattling of warmen’s lances; and the clamours of assailants,
and the clanking of bits, and the neighing of steeds; while the world was canopied
with dense dust and sand-clouds raised by the horses’ hoofs.”</p>

<p class="c000">As we said before, however, for a fair comparison we must refer our readers to the
works themselves. Those who will take the pains to read Burton’s side by side with any
of the received translations, will, we have no question, recognise its vast superiority in
every way. On the question of fulness it is enough to say that if the remaining volumes
are of the same size as the first, Burton’s contains more than half as much again as
Lane’s.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_477">477</span>We must not omit to mention the explanatory notes. “I can hardly imagine the
<cite>Nights</cite> being read to any profit by men of the West without commentary,” says Sir
Richard Burton. “My annotations avoid only one subject, the parallels of European
folk-lore and fabliaux which, however interesting, would overswell the bulk of a book
whose speciality is anthropology.” “The scholar who adds to mine the notes of Lane,
will know as much of the Moslem East, and more than many Europeans who have spent
half their lives in Orient lands. Such, at least, is my belief.” The notes are brief
enough not to be passed over, and are conveniently placed at foot of the page.</p>

<p class="c000">Referring briefly to the <em>matter</em> of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, we cannot do better than
quote the words of Sir R. Burton again:—</p>

<h4 class="c030">“<span class="sc">The Matter of the ‘Nights.’</span></h4>

<p class="c027">“The general tone is exceptionally high and pure. The devotional fervour often
rises to the boiling point of fanaticism. The pathos is sweet, deep, and genuine; tender,
simple, and true; utterly unlike much of our modern tinsel. Its life, strong, splendid,
and multitudinous, is everywhere flavoured with that unaffected pessimism and constitutional
melancholy which strike deepest root under the brightest skies and which sigh in
the face of heaven:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vita quid est hominis? Viridis floriscula mortis;</span></div>
      <div class="line"><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sole oriente oriens, sole cadente cadens.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">“Poetical justice is administered by the literary Kazi with exemplary impartiality
and severity, ‘denouncing evil-doers and eulogising deeds admirably achieved.’ The
<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> is sound and healthy, and at times we descry vistas of transcendental morality—the
morality of Socrates in Plato. It is, indeed, this unique contrast of a quaint element,
childish crudities, jostling the finest and highest views of life and character, shown in the
kaleidoscopic shiftings of the marvellous picture with many a ’rich truth in a tale’s
pretence’; pointed by a rough, dry humour which compares well with ‘wut’; the
alternations of strength and weakness, of pathos and bathos, of the boldest poetry (the
diction of Job) and the boldest prose (the Egyptian of to-day), and, finally, the whole
dominated everywhere by that marvellous Oriental fancy, wherein the spiritual and the
supernatural are as common as the material and the natural; it is the contrast, I say,
which forms the chiefest charm of <cite>The Nights</cite>, which gives it the most striking
originality, and which makes it a perfect expositor of the mediæval Moslem mind.”</p>

<p class="c000">At the present the first volume only of the work has reached us. We shall give our
readers early notice of the appearance of the remaining five.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Queen</cite>, <em>January 27th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As regards the text, the poetical portions are exhibited in a metrical form, and all
divisions and breaks are carefully indicated. The foot-notes are both numerous and
important, and they should by no means be lightly passed ever, giving, as they do, much
valuable information, explanatory and illustrative, which the “home student” will profit
by. This great effort will be extensively appreciated, and not a few will read and learn
more than otherwise they would or could have done respecting those wonderful tribes and
nations, among whom still linger so much of the lore which instructs as well as fascinates,
not only themselves, but the children of the West. We have read considerable portions of
this volume, and compared them with a popular English edition, and, without hesitation,
we say that the style of this is far better, and the arrangement very much to be preferred.
The colloquial terms and homely phrases, we presume, truly reflect the original, as do
<span class="pageno" id="Page_478">478</span>some other unusual forms of expression. Meanwhile, we regard the book with much
satisfaction, and hope it will receive a hearty welcome from the well-instructed and
inquiring reader who seeks wisdom as well as recreation.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">County Gentleman</cite>, <em>February, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Several of the stories now issued are in the form of apalogues or fables, in which the
inferior animals are the chief actors and interlocutors. Amongst these we may mention,
the tales of the Water Fowl and the Tortoise, the Wolf and the Fox, the Mouse and the
Ichneumon, the Cat and the Crow, the Hedgehog and the Wood Pigeons, and the Sparrow
and the Peacock. There is, of course, here a suggestion or a reminiscence of Æsop, but
the Arabian fabulists take a line of their own. There are striking differences between the
two authors or sets of authors, both in the narrative form and in the ethical quality of the
moral conveyed. And this difference may, we think, on examination, be traced to
national idiosyncrasy and modes of thought. The fables of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> have less
point and conciseness, and less of harmonious subservience of details to unity of effect and
impression than those of great Ethiopian. On the other hand, they have greater perfection
of literary form, far more splendid imagery, and in some instances more psychological
subtlety in the somewhat long-drawn disquisitive, and, indeed, disputatious
dialogues in which the chief characters indulge. For our own part, we have found this
introduction of the lower animal element an interesting temporary departure from the
comprehensive and elaborate, and, sooth to say, somewhat monotonous representations of
men and their affairs which form the staple of these gorgeous productions of an ancient
Oriental loom. In the story of the Wolf and the Fox we have an example of the justification
of the lex talionis, which mingles somewhat curiously with the general exhortations
to mercy and forgiveness, founded on the maxims of the Sacred Books. In our notice of
the first volume we made some inadequate attempt to express our admiration of the virile
beauty and force of Sir Richard Burton’s translation. Only captious critics will consider
that he has strained a point in his use of obsolete words and phrases, or in his happy
invention of new collocations. As these are invariably conceived and expressed in the
spirit of the original Arabic, they present to our mind the aspect of beauties rather than
blemishes, and indisputably add to the Oriental flavour of this fine translation. The notes
are in themselves a liberal education in respect of Persian and Arabian manners and
customs, old and new.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Bat</cite>, <em>February 8th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The most marvellous collection of stories in the world is for the first time placed before
the English readers. Positively for the first time. Those who know the Arabian Nights,
through the charming, but ludicrously unoriental, paraphrase of Galland, or through the
solid, and perhaps slightly stolid, rendering of Lane, cannot be said to know the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite> at all. It would be indeed a thousand pities if such a book as Sir Richard has
made were to be entirely tabooed to the world at large and to women. The matchless
wealth of fancy of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, the amazing wealth of knowledge which Sir
Richard Burton has accumulated about it, the glowing virile prose in which these Eastern
tales have been imbued with a new vitality, all these should be the possession, not of a
poor thousand students and scholars, but of all the myriad readers of books who speak
the English speech * * * Now, for the first time, all that enchanted Eastern
world is open to everyone. Jean Paul Richter, most delightful of German writers, has
dwelt, in his great essay on education, on the importance of Oriental fiction in the
education of the young. It is easy to imagine the delight with which he would have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_479">479</span>welcomed the masterpieces of Oriental fancy which have now, for the first time, been
placed within the reach of all who care to read.</p>

<p class="c000">The reader passes at once into the most exquisite world of fancy, where enchanted
princesses, caliphs and mock caliphs, wizards, ghouls, jinns, barmecides, kalandars, sultans,
slaves, mullahs, and dancing-girls jostle one another in a mad merry world of their own, by
the yellow Nile or the yellow Tigris. All the life of the East—vivid, passionate, fantastic,
poetic—lives in these entrancing pages, and the reader who knows them, and knows them
well, knows more about oriental life and oriental thought than many who have passed
half their lives in Cairo or Bagdad.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Morning Post</cite>, <em>February 14th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">In the volume under notice are comprised the tales from the 78th to the 275th night
inclusive. They are remarkable for their originality and poetic sentiment, and the spirit
of chivalry which animates the heroes. The tales of birds and beasts are fables containing
a wholesome moral.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Morning Advertiser</cite>, <em>February 26th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The poetic imagery of the Arabic masterpiece is presented in all its naive and native
charm, almost as far as such a thing is possible, when we remember the immense gulf
which sunders the ideas and tongues of the Orients from our own mental methods and
modes of speech. The use of rhymed prose by the translator is most judicious, and
enhances the impression produced by the Arabic simile and metaphor, as in the following,
where Sulayman Shah prepares to send forth his Wazir to sue for the hand of the daughter
of Zahr Shah:—“Then he hied to his own house and bade make ready presents
befitting Kings, of precious stones and things of price, and other matters light of load
but weighty of worth, besides Arab steeds and coats of mail, such as David made, and
chests of treasure for which speech hath no measure.” Again we find the same use of
rhyme in the Wazir’s mention to the celibate King of the charms of the Princess:—“Know,
O King, it hath come to my knowledge that King Zahr Shah, Lord of the White
Land, hath a daughter of surpassing loveliness, whose charms talk and tale fail to express.
She hath not her equal in this age, for she is perfect in proportion and symmetry, blackeyed
as if kohl-dyed and long-locked, wee of waist and full of form.” The couplets in
which many of the characters after composing their minds unbind their tongues puts the
resources of the Queen’s English to some strain. Here is a specimen of how the
emissary of Sulayman Shah “displayed the oratory of Wazirs and saluted the King in
the language of eloquence.” When it is remembered, however, that the Arabic verse is
improvised, we can afford to be charitable to the not unsuccessful effort of the translator,
who has no small difficulties to cope with. It runs as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He cometh robed and bending gracefully:</div>
      <div class="line">O’er face and figure dews of grace sheds he:</div>
      <div class="line">He charms: nor characts, spells, nor grammarye</div>
      <div class="line">May fend the glances of those eyne from thee.</div>
      <div class="line">O heart! th’ art not the sole that loveth him,</div>
      <div class="line">So live with him while I desertion dree.</div>
      <div class="line">There’s naught to joy mine eyes with joyous sound</div>
      <div class="line">Save praise of King Zahr Shah in jubilee:</div>
      <div class="line">A King! albeit thou leave thy life to win</div>
      <div class="line">One look, that look were all sufficiency;</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_480">480</span>And if a pious prayer thou breathe for him,</div>
      <div class="line">Shall join all faithful in such pious gree:</div>
      <div class="line">Folk of his realm! If any shirk his right for other hoping, gross unfaith I see.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Still, though the English is a little quaint, and every period in the history of the
language is laid under contribution to supply material of verbiage, this very circumstance
heightens the effect upon the mind of the reader of the strange scenery, the bizarre
situation, and the eccentricity—according to our notions—of the characters? * * *
Men who as children have revelled in this narrative of wonders, and then accepted them
with implicit and ingenuous trust, will return to it again to find light shed on the customs
and manners of the East. The very instructive notes elucidate the text, and so the
reader may, as he peruses, not only discover delight for his fancy, but gain information
about the social life of lands which, though the Western world has varied and altered
over and over again, have for ages remained in their main social features unchanged so
much so as to lead many observers to regard them as unchangeable. Down at the bottom
of all we read, however, the great truth that human nature is much the same all the
world over, and in all ages, in its joys and griefs, its gratifications and its heartburnings.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Army and Navy Gazette</cite>, <em>February 26th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Sir Richard Burton was a bold man when he wrote, and the Kamashastra Society of
Benares was a bold society when it printed his great translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.
Yet the boldness of both has been amply justified, for never before was the golden prime
of the Caliphs of Baghdad, with all its Oriental colour, brought so vividly before the
reading public. Nor could any demur be made justly to the book, as the issue of a
private press, because of the indelicacy, not to say pruriency, that characterised it, since
it is plainly inconsistent to judge the morals of one age by the standard of another, and
this translation of “The Thousand Nights and a Night” was intended not only to make
accessible the great work of Arabian fiction, but also to illustrate the social conditions of
those for whom it was composed. It must be remembered, moreover, that in these days
refinement has progressed so rapidly that the books even which delighted our grandmothers
have become too indelicate for the family circle; and, if we go on in the same direction,
it is certain that ere long Swinburne will be Bowdlerised, and fifty years hence who can
say that the Laureate himself will escape? There could have been no more fitting
translator for the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> than Sir Richard Burton, who is as much at home in
Eastern bazaars as the very disciples of the Prophet, who has himself made the pilgrimage
to Al-Medinah and to Meccah, and who, as the result of a vast experience of all phases
of Oriental life, has been able to enter into the very spirit of the wondrous Arab tales.
In comparing his work with that of his best predecessors, in the translation, Mr. John
Payne and Mr. E. W. Lane, becomes speedily apparent that the former was weak as a
linguist, while the latter driven thereto by the necessity of making a book for the family
circle, used his pruning-knife much too freely, and cut out some of the very best pieces—notably,
the major part of the excellent story, which is of great length, of King Omar
bin al-Nu’uman and his Sons, whereof he has preserved but two small episodes. Another
great advantage which Sir Richard Burton possesses over other translators is his exquisite
sense of the delicate beauty of Arabic poetry, which has enabled him to preserve in his
graceful rendering of the many verses scattered through the stories, much of the character
of Oriental assonance and rhythm. We take an example, almost at random, from the
first volume:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Shall the beautiful hue of the Basil fail,</div>
      <div class="line">Tho’ the beetle’s foot over the Basil crawl?</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_481">481</span>And though spider and fly be its denizens,</div>
      <div class="line in2">Shall disgrace attach to the royal hall?</div>
      <div class="line">The cowrie, I ken, shall have currency,</div>
      <div class="line in2">But the pearl’s clear drop,—shall its value fall?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Fun</cite>, <em>March 2nd, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">We readily repeat our expression of the high estimation in which we hold the
superiority of this translation over all others. Many stories are included which have
hitherto been left untold.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Bookseller</cite>, <em>March 4th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The progress of this charming work continues apace, in the appearance of a further
volume going down to the “Five Hundred and Fifty-Seventh Night” of Shahrazad’s
world-famous tales. Within the limits of the new instalment will be found several old
favourites, such as Harun Al-Rashid and the Slave Girl, The Ebony (Flying) Horse, and
The Voyages of Sindbad the Sailor. Sir Richard Burton’s notes which liberally accompany
the text, are by no means the least entertaining portion of the book, leading, as they
do, to many suggestive comparisons with Scriptural and mythological analogies, and to
points of etymology as curious as they are instructive. The story of the “Death-Angel
and the Rich King,” by the way, is so closely akin to the Parables of the Rich Fool and
the Unjust Steward of the Gospels, that it is difficult to believe that they did not serve
as the original of the Arabian counterpart.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Allen’s Indian Mail</cite>, <em>March 7th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">On reading the first volume again and again the reflection occurred, how little—how
very little—the general public know, as to the tales of which the name is familiar in
every circle of society. Still more does this fact force itself into notice in the second
volume. Not a story do we meet which bears a name linked with the memoirs of youth
or the recollections of early age. What is the explanation? Are all the tales, which for
generation after generation, have played their part in the nursery, merely idle dreams of
a fanciful edition of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite> or are the well-known stories
reserved for the last? We cannot say: but we avow with some trepidation, that we have
not hitherto met with a single friendly face amongst the two hundred and fifty divisions
as yet presented to the public.</p>

<p class="c000">If, however, we have expected against expectation for some landmark to show us the
road whereon we are travelling, it must notwithstanding, be avowed that in the present
continuation of the tales there is much to interest, and perhaps more to instruct. Apart
from this, there is such vast array of wisdom contained in this storehouse of experience
and knowledge that the world should be wise, and, therefore, happier in learning
what dangers to avoid, what virtues to cultivate, what vices to eradicate. Then, too,
as regards the notes by Sir Richard Burton. It would be impossible to exaggerate
their worth, their depth, or the insight that they afford into the inner life of the Arabian
natives, a life of which so little is known, though so much is talked—a life which has
much to recommend it—albeit Exeter Hall is loud in its dispraise, and the advocates
<span class="pageno" id="Page_482">482</span>of women’s rights are passionate in denunciation thereof. Like all other nations the
people of the East have their faults, but who are they which presume to cast the first
stone?</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Lunes</cite>, <em>January 3rd, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Few people know anything of the trouble and the travelling which Sir Richard
Burton has undertaken in the accomplishment of his tremendous task. He has ransacked
all the libraries of the East and West, and has often undertaken a roving but idle quest
in the hope of throwing clearer light on a single disputed passage. His profound
acquaintance with Oriental languages and literature is shown at every turn, and, preserving
the romantic colouring of the original in a poetic rhythm of expression, he has
cast his finished version in a form which is singularly picturesque.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Allen’s Indian Mail</cite>, <em>January 17th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The reason is not far to seek, since there never has been a really good translation
of this most untranslateable of Oriental works. From such a sweeping assertion must
be excluded the happy and successful effort of Mr. John Payne; but this latter work was
printed for the Villon Society, and the issue being restricted to five hundred copies,
while the author bound himself “not to reproduce the work in its complete form,” the
version is and must ever be “caviare to the general.” Such being the case Sir Richard
Burton bethought himself that he would employ his leisure hours in presenting to the
public a trustworthy and withal picturesque translation of the <cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>:
and who more fitted for such task? * * * * We have no hesitation
in pronouncing the present version of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> to be incontestably the best
extant. Perfection is not given to mortals, but the tales now appear in as satisfactory
a garb as is possible; and henceforth there will be no excuse should the English
public fail to become familiar with a work which all should read—the time-honoured
<cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Liverpool Mercury</cite>, <em>March 26th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">We have read with mingled admiration and delight every line of Sir Richard
Burton’s wonderful rendering of the world-famous but never till now adequately translated
<em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>. * * * * At the same time, in
any literal reproduction of the ancient folk-stories of a race having different customs
and modes of thought to our own there must necessarily be passages which are unsuited
to modern English tastes. * * * The first writer who undertook to introduce
the Nights to Europe was M. Galland, a Frenchman who made Arabic his study,
and travelled not a little in the Eastern countries which border on the Mediterranean
close upon two centuries ago. What he did, however, was not to translate the entire
work, or even one-half of it, but to paraphrase certain selections from it, to add other
stories of Eastern origin thereto, and to dress up the whole in a composite literary style
which reflected the French tastes of the time far more accurately than those of the Arab
tribes from whose romantic folk-lore he drew his inspiration. Other labourers in the
same field—and there have been many—have but too faithfully followed upon the lines
laid down by M. Galland. Until quite lately the best European paraphrase of the
<cite>Nights</cite> was that of the late distinguished Orientalist, Lane; but even he took an
abbreviated edition of the original as his standard, and, while omitting at least one-third
<span class="pageno" id="Page_483">483</span>of the stories which it contained, failed altogether to reproduce the distinctive characteristics
of the remainder.</p>

<p class="c000">This being so, Captain Sir Richard Burton, in the interests of Oriental scholarship—which
he rightly judges to be nowhere more important than among a people who have
so vast an Eastern empire to govern and safeguard as we have—has for years past been
engaged upon a literal translation of the <cite>Nights</cite> which should be worthy at once of the
original sources from which it was taken and of his own hard-earned reputation. At
the very time that he was putting the finishing touches to his work and preparing for
publication, however, he learnt by accident that Mr. John Payne had undertaken for the
Villon Society a precisely similar task. Upon that Sir Richard, with characteristic
chivalry, stood aside, and allowed Mr. Payne to have the advantage of prior publication;
we mean, of course, such publication as he himself contemplated and the Villon Society
contents itself with—the issue, that is, of a strictly limited number of copies supplied to
subscribers only. Of his rival’s translation Sir Richard Burton, with the enthusiasm of a
true scholar, says, “It is most readable; his (Mr. Payne’s) English, with a sub-flavour
of Mabinogionic archaism, is admirable, and his style gives life and light to the nine
volumes whose matter is frequently heavy enough; he succeeds admirably in the most
difficult passages, and he often hits upon choice and special terms and the exact
vernacular equivalent of the foreign word, so happily and so picturesquely that all future
translators must perforce use the same expression under pain of falling far short.”
Nevertheless, though coming four or five years afterwards, Sir Richard’s own edition
fairly takes the field, and is likely, we should say, to hold it permanently against all
future comers. The notes alone carry it to a point of perfection hitherto unattained. It
is the work of a man better qualified for the task than any other living being. On the
one hand, we know of no one who is so thoroughly imbued with the spirit and soaked
in the traditions of Arab life as the traveller who, disguised as an Arab, succeeded in
making the pilgrimage to Mecca without detection; on the other, we know of no translator
who has at his command such an amazing vocabulary of English words wherewith
to reflect every shade of meaning, every turn of phrase, every subtile touch of literary colour
in the language from which he translates. As illustrating his mastery of the secrets both
of Arab life and of picturesque English, take the following passage from his “Foreword.”
He is speaking of the solace and satisfaction which he derived from working upon his
translation of the <cite>Nights</cite> during his long years of official banishment to the luxuriant and
deadly deserts of Western Africa, and to the dull and dreary half-clearings of South
America.</p>

<p class="c000">“From my commonplace and ‘respectable’ surroundings (he says) the Jinn bore
me at once to the land of my predilection, Arabia—a region so familiar to my mind that
even at first sight it seemed a reminiscence of some bygone metemphysic life in the distant
past. Again I stood under the diaphanous skies in air glorious as ether, whose every
breath raises men’s spirits like sparkling wine. Once more I saw the evening star hanging
like a solitaire from the pure front of the western firmament; and the after-glow
transfiguring and transforming, as if by magic, the homely and rugged features of the
scene into a fairy-land, lit with a light which never shines on other soils or seas. Then
would appear the woollen tents, low and black, of the true Bedawin, mere dots in the
boundless waste of lion-tawny clays and gazelle-brown gravels, and the camp fire dotting
like a glowworm the village centre. Presently, sweetened by distance, would be heard
the wild weird song of lads and lasses, driving, or rather pelting, through the gloaming
their sheep and goats; and the measured chant of the spearmen gravely stalking behind
their charge, the camels; mingled with the bleating of the flocks and the bellowing of
the humpy herds; while the reremouse flitted overhead with his tiny shriek, and the rave
of the jackal resounded through deepening glooms, and—most musical of music—the
palm-trees answered the whispers of the night-breeze with the softest tones of falling
<span class="pageno" id="Page_484">484</span>water. And then a shift of scene. The Shaykhs and ‘White-beards’ of the tribe gravely
take their places, sitting with outspread skirts like hillocks on the plain, as the Arabs
say, around the camp-fire, whilst I reward their hospitality and secure its continuance by
reading or reciting a few pages of their favourite tales. The women and children stand
motionless as silhouettes outside the ring, and all are breathless with attention; they
seem to drink in the words with eyes and mouths as well as with ears. The most
fantastic lights of fancy, the wildest improbabilities, the most impossible of impossibilities,
appear to them utterly natural—mere matters of every-day occurrence. They enter
thoroughly into each phase of feeling touched upon by the author; they take a personal
pride in the chivalrous nature and knightly prowess of Taj al-Mulúk; they are touched
with tenderness by the self-sacrificing love of Azizah; their mouths water as they hear
of heaps of untold gold given away in largesse like clay; they chuckle with delight every
time a Kázir or a Fakír—a judge or a reverend—is scurvily entreated by some Pantagruelist
of the Wilderness; and, despite their normal solemnity and impassibility, all
roar with laughter, sometimes rolling upon the ground till the reader’s gravity is sorely
tried, at the tales of the garrulous Barber and of Ali and the Kurdish sharper.”</p>

<p class="c000">Clearly an Englishman who can thus hold an Arab encampment spell-bound by
reciting to them their own folk-stories in their own tongue has at least one indisputable
qualification for translating the famous collection of these stories embodied in the “<cite>Alf
Laylah wa Laylah</cite>”—the “Thousand Nights and a Night.”</p>

<p class="c000">But this is not all. Sir Richard Burton has a literary conscience which craves to be
satisfied, and an imitative faculty, supported by exhaustless wealth and ingenuity of
expression, capable of satisfying it. Not content with giving us a faithful transcript both
of the matter and of the informing spirit of the great Arabian Saga-book, he is careful
to reproduce for us even its mechanism and its music—its peculiarities of structure, the
balance of its sentences, the rhyme, the rhythm, the assonances, the cadences, the
melody, the lilt, the very jingle of its language. How necessary all this is to the
preservation of what may be termed the literary flavour of the original may be gathered
from the first few lines upon which we light on turning to a page at random. A king
sending gifts and a missive to another king by his wazir commands that functionary “to
shorten his skirts and strain his strength and make all expedition in going and returning.
‘Hearkening and obedience!’ quoth the minister, who fell to making ready without
stay, and packed up his loads and prepared all his requisites without delay. This
occupied him three days, and on the dawn of the fourth he took leave of his king and
marched right away, over desert and hill-way, stony waste and pleasant lea, without
halting by night or day,” and so on—in which passage, as one sees, the recurrence
of the same consonantal sounds, and of rhyming and nearly rhyming words at irregular
distances gives a distinctive character to the style of the narrative. Many other passages
might be quoted in illustration of similar tricks and subtleties of literary skill, which
impart an additional charm to the book, if for no other reason, because they are racy
of the soil from which it sprang, and give an air of greater vraisemblance to the translation.
But the space at our disposal is well-nigh exhausted, and we are desirous of
giving just one quotation from Sir Richard Burton’s “Foreword” as to the matter of
the <cite>Nights</cite>.</p>

<p class="c000">“The general tone” (he writes) “is exceptionally high and pure. The devotional
feeling often rises to the boiling point of fanaticism. The pathos is sweet, deep and
genuine: tender, simple, and true; utterly unlike much of our modern tinsel. Its
life, strong, splendid, and multitudinous, is everywhere flavoured with that unaffected
pessimism and constitutional melancholy which strike deepest root under the brightest
skies, and which sigh in the face of heaven. Poetical justice is administered by the
literary Kázi with exemplary impartiality and severity, ‘denouncing evil-doers and
eulogising deeds admirably achieved.’ The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> is sound and healthy, and at times
<span class="pageno" id="Page_485">485</span>we descry vistas of a transcendental morality, the morality of Socrates or Plato. It is,
indeed, this unique contrast of a quaint element childish crudities, jostling the finest and
highest views of life and character, shown in the kaleidoscopic shiftings of the marvellous
picture with many a ‘rich truth in a tale’s pretence,’  pointed by a rough, dry humour
which compares well with ‘wut;’ the alternatives of strength and weakness; of
pathos and bathos; of boldest poetry (the diction of Job) and the baldest prose (the
Egyptian of to-day); and, finally, the whole dominated everywhere by that marvellous
Oriental fancy wherein the spiritual and the supernatural are as common as the material
and the natural; it is this contrast, I say, which forms the chiefest charm of the <cite>Nights</cite>,
which gives it the most striking originality, and which makes it a perfect expositor of
the mediæval Moslem mind.”</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Academy</cite>, <em>March 12th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The second volume contains <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter alia</span></i>, the delightful story of Prince Camaralzaman
and the Princess Badr ool Budoor, which loses none of its old charm as “The Tale of
Kamar al-Zaman,” and gains incalculably by being translated into Sir Richard Burton’s
rich, quaint, and picturesque English. The third volume brings another, and a still
more familiar favourite, in the story of “Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad the Landsman,”
told with a force and vivacity which make it all seem as true as it seemed in the
days of our credulous childhood. In both volumes we find a large number of minor
tales which are not included in Lane’s edition; as, for instance, the stories of four
chiefs of police, and a whole series of charming fables about beasts, and “other small
game.” The long chivalric history of “King Omar bin al-Nu’uman and his sons,
Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan” (also one of those omitted by Lane), is a distinct gain
in a collection so complete and extensive as the present. As regards Sir Richard
Burton’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">dramatis personæ</span></i>, treatment and style, we need only say that his foul fiends
and ancient duennas are more variously hideous, his couplets more steeped in Oriental
passion, his descriptive passages more elaborately rhythmic than ever; while the foot-notes
are so interesting and full of information that one only regrets that they are so
sparingly inserted.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Manchester Examiner</cite>, <em>March 16th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Whatever differences of opinion there may be concerning the translator’s taste or
judgment, all will agree that the work in its complete form is emphatically a student’s
book—that in the mind of the general reading public it is an impossibility to reproduce
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</span></i> simplicity with which the story-tellers of an earlier age and a warmer clime
treated those incidents which a contemporary essayist has happily termed “the enclosed
facts of life.” Concerning the original, it is not necessary to speak at length. The
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is one of the great books of the world, and as a revelation of the
outer and inner life of the Orient is quite unique, but it is only during quite recent years
that the general reader has had any opportunity of knowing the full extent of its riches.
True, English translations have been common enough for the last century, but they
have been, for the most part taken, <em>not</em> immediately from the Arabic, but immediately
through a French reproduction, often so garbled in substance, and in form as to convey
nothing like a voracious impression of the original. Of late, however, serious study of
Arabic has become more common among English scholars, and we have at least three
translations—those of Mr. John Payne, of Mr. Lane, and of Sir Richard Burton—not
one of which can be charged with doing injustice to the great classic. As a mere
translations each will have its supporters, and it would be absurd for a critic who is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_486">486</span>unacquainted with Arabic to say that this or that is the best; but it may be urged on
behalf of Sir Richard Burton that he is more than a mere translator, that he is an
accomplished Orientalist, and that the best years of his life have been spent among the
very scenes with which the ancient romancers deal. Then, too, his personal idiosyncrasy
is such that he can enter easily, naturally, and without any strain into the life of which
the stories are a crowded panorama, can breathe the spirit of the times and manners,
and reproduce it in such wise that we can breathe it too. It is no exaggeration to say
that he possesses unique qualifications for the task he has so laboriously and adequately
performed.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">County Gentleman</cite>, <em>March 19th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Volume III. consists of no less than 83 tales, which bring down the marvellous
sequence of stories invented in self-defence by “the liberator of her sex” to the 557th
night. Of these tales, while many of the less familiar are full of beauty and suggestiveness,
the last, relating the wonderful adventures of Sindbad the Seaman will be welcomed
as an old and much-esteemed friend. The old friend, too, though he does not come to
us with exactly a new face, offers to our charmed recognition a face much brightened
and beautified, and decked with the goodly raiment of Sir Richard Burton’s inimitable
translation. Many of the tales are very short, but some of the shortest are really the
most delightful. Take, for example, the one recording the generous dealing of Yahya,
son of Khalid, with a convicted forger, and the one referring to the Caliph Al-Maamun
and the Strange Scholar. The directness and forceful simplicity of these brief narratives,
which would merit a high place in any collection of succinct apologues of the virtues,
as well as the almost Christianity of their teaching, cannot fail to impress any discerning
reader. The note on page 58 to the first of these tales is one of similar commentaries
throwing light upon Eastern customs and institutions. At the same time it marks the
continuity of Oriental political ideas.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Army and Navy Gazette</cite>, <em>March 27th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">This volume, bringing us down to the 557th night, and to the fifth voyage of
Sindbad the Seaman, includes a large number of stories quite new to the reader, some
of them brimful of humour, and others most interesting from many points of view, from
which it would be easy to quote endless readable items. Harun al-Rashid, Al-Maamun,
Isaac of Mosul, and Ja’afar the Barmecide figure here very often; but more amusement
is to be derived from the doings of lesser people, as, for example, the sharp-witted
vagabonds who generally escape the chastisement they deserve by some ingenious trick,
such as the Oriental mind delights in. The story of Al-Maamun and the Pyramids of
Egypt (omitted by Lane) illustrates the mediæval Arabic view of those monuments—viz.,
that they were rich treasure-houses, which it was desirable to plunder if possible;
and there are other tales dealing with crusading times, and with the relations of
Christians and Moslems. One great charm of these stories is their endless variety,
which prevents them from ever becoming monotonous, and Sir Richard Burton’s
English has a quaint and sometimes quite archaic cast which accords well with his
subject. As we said, in speaking of the earlier volumes, this is by far the best translation
of the <cite>Nights</cite> for general reading, and we are sure, in its present handsome
form, it will find a place on most library shelves.</p>

<p class="c027">Then Sir Richard goes on to tell us all about the origin of the <cite>Nights</cite>, their
birth-place, and their probable date; the means by which, and the strangely incomplete
and inaccurate forms in which they found their way into Europe; the matter and the
manner of the <cite>Nights</cite>, the social condition of Al-Islam which they disclose, and the
peculiarities of the prose-rhyme and poetry in which they are written. The work—translation
and commentary alike—is done throughout with the thoroughness which
characterises everything Sir Richard Burton takes in hand; and, in the result, we have
such a conspectus of Arab life, Arab thought, and Arab literature as could only have
proceeded from the mind of one who years ago was so soaked in Arabian customs and
traditions as to make the pilgrimage to Mecca, in the character of a good Moslem,
without detection. A complete index to the tales and proper names, and a bibliography
of all the principal editions of the <cite>Nights</cite>, fittingly round off a work which, as it can
never be superseded, must inevitably take its place among the few achievements of human
effort from which Time reverently withholds his destroying hand.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Christian Union</cite>, <em>April, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Those who are at all conversant with the old productions of this work will readily
discover the distinctive difference and characteristic features of Sir Richard F. Burton’s
translation, that it excels in originality, style, and graphicness all other editions of
the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. No one who has read the work will hesitate to accept. Regard
it in whatever aspect we will, it is unique in its production, and will henceforth take
the precedence of all other translations.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Morning Advertiser</cite>, <em>April 8th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As pointed out in previous notices of this admirable work, it possesses many charms
which have hitherto been lost to European readers by the manner in which the tales
have been presented to them in the current versions of the narratives. Although these
stories, among many other collections, have been in circulation for ages through the
East, they have not yet been known in Europe for two hundred years. They were first
introduced into Christendom, indeed, by means of the translation of Antoine Galland, a
distinguished French Orientalist. They were, as a matter of course, everywhere hailed
with delight, although, with perhaps rare exceptions, until the appearance of Lane’s
edition, the many translations of the tales into European languages, merely gave the
narratives themselves. The numerous and ample notes and philological comparisons,
which are profusely scattered through it, and which serve to convey the exact meaning
of important words in the text, are not only most interesting in themselves, but are often
of indispensable necessity to the grasping of the point of the story. Several examples of
this will again be found in the present volume. In some places the translator is completely
at variance with Lane, who appears, in the instances cited, to have missed the
point of the story, from a misapprehension of the true signification of an important
word. A remarkable example of the extent to which the force of the narrative is seen
to depend on the skill of the translator, occurs in the story of “the Illiterate, who sit
up as a teacher,” in which it is remarked in a foot-note, that Lane appears to have
mistaken for a girdle, a word which simply means the usual brazier for the charcoal
which serves for a fire, and so to have missed the whole point of the tale. In this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_488">488</span>volume will also be seen several fine examples of the rhymed prose, which form one of
the great beauties of the work. The translations of the many pieces of Eastern poetry
which adorn the tales, are most elegant and felicitous. They are also most unique in
their character. In many instances obsolete words have been introduced with wonderfully
pleasing effect, and in other Saxon words and Saxon locutions in close relation
with modern German, from their immediate connexion with the text, the notes are full
of learning—geographical, philological, and antiquarian—which contains an immense
body of useful knowledge on the matters to which they relate.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Daily News</cite>, <em>April 28th, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The present volume contains not many of our old friends, like “Aladdin” and the
“Forty Thieves,” but is rich in those Oriental stories of beasts, which often much
resemble the romances of “Uncle Remus.” The tale of the Animals and the Son of
Adam, if one remembers correctly, does come, with a difference, in “Uncle Remus.”
As an example of the value and interest of the notes, may be cited the remarks on the
“lucky signs,” which add to the value of horses. Mohammed disliked horses with
white stockings on alternate hoofs. The tale of the Wolf and the Fox is again in Uncle
Remus’s style. It is a very difficult thing to account for the migration of these stories.
Even the bushmen have a version of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">vestigia nulla retrorsum</span></i>, and Professor Hartt was
told similar fables by the Indians of the Amazon. Huet, Bishop of Avranches, knew
that such stories were current among the Hurons and Iroquois, whose hero, if not
exactly Brer Rabbit, is usually Brer Hare. The Sawahílis, also, make an animal very
like a rabbit take the best parts. Occasionally, the translation itself needs notes for
some readers, who may ask what the Fox means when he sings of the Wolf that “garred
me drain eisel and fell.” It will interest some mythologists to know that dawn, in
Persian, is called by a name meaning “Wolf’s tail.” Prince Kamar al-Zaman is in
this volume in all his glory, compared to which, that of Solomon was mere tinsel.
Probably only Orientalists can properly estimate the labour and erudition of these
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. The notes on the Diamond Valley, and the Roc, and other pleasant
marvels are very instructive. The following note is curious. We say melanchólia,
with the accent on the o: the Arabs say Malikhulíya, with the accent on the penultimate,
and probably, or rather certainly, the Greeks from who we both borrowed the word did
the same, as the Greek accent indicates. But how they read their own poetry, on this
system, who can explain or understand?</p>

    <div><cite>THE ARABIAN NIGHTS.</cite></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Sir Richard Burton has certainly conferred a great boon on the reading public, great
and small, by this edition of <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>. <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite> has hitherto
been known to us chiefly as Aristotle is said to have been known to the Schoolmen, in a
translation of a translation. The work of Galland, a Frenchman who was, according to
Lane and Burton, not over well-skilled in Arabic, and who knew little of Arabic manners
and customs, has hitherto, in various translations and adaptations, been the source of
popular knowledge of <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>. Lane’s own translation was a little too much
like Sir Richard Burton’s <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</span></i>, in being too close to the original for modern
manners or drawing room use. And, to tell the truth, it is also a trifle bald and dull.
Moreover, it is disfigured to the ordinary eye, much like Grote’s <cite>Greece</cite>, by uncouth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_489">489</span>renderings of more or less familiar names. It is terrible, for instance, to see Aziz and Azizah
rendered by Azeez and Azeezah, to find Sindbad converted into es-Sindhibad, and our
old friend the Vizier turned into a Weezer; and to be encountered on every page by some
terrible Arabic word for the meaning of which you have to refer to notes, those torments
of the interested reader. Sir Richard Burton indeed, does not wholly spare our old
friends. But Wazir for Vizier is better than Weezer; and while Lane converts Noureddin
and the fair Persian into Noor ed-Deen and Enees-al-Jalees, Sir Richard Burton only
goes so far as Nur al-Din and Anis al-Jalis. The most striking novelty in this translation
is the preservation of the rhymed prose, a jingle of assonance running through the more
lively passages, particularly where love or fighting are concerned. Thus, in the Second
Kalendar’s tale, we have,—“Her figure measured five feet in height: her form was firm
and upright: her cheek a very garden of delight: her colour lively bright: her face
gleamed like dawn through curly tresses which gloomed like night;” and when
Sharrkan, the Moslem cavalier fights the Franks, “they fell to fighting and to wheeling
left and right, and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from
strife and sword-play, and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to
night and darkness overwhelmed the light.” Taken in connection with the context, the
effect, though strange and bizarre, is not unpleasing, and gives a sense of something outlandish
which accords well with the subject. Another novelty is the translation into
verse of the verses copiously scattered about the stories, which have hitherto been
omitted or turned into prose. It must be admitted that these verses are rather boring.
They are mostly of the ultra-sentimental and “high falutin’” order, with exaggerated
sentiment and metaphors. Here is a sample:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Had we known of thy coming, we fain had dispread ✿ the cores of our hearts or the balls of our eyes:</div>
      <div class="line">Our cheeks as a carpet to greet thee had thrown, ✿ and our eyelids had strown for thy feet to betread.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Some of them, however, are pretty enough in feeling and expression. But the
translator has invented a barbarous expedient for plaguing the reader, and preventing his
taking them quickly, by placing an asterisk in the middle of each line to represent the
couplets of the original. As he does not really retain the metres of the original, there is
no valid excuse for thus disfiguring the page and trying the reader’s temper, and we
sincerely hope that, if not for later volumes, at all events for later editions, he will
abandon this excruciating invention.</p>

<p class="c000">With this exception, there is no doubt that this is the most readable as well as the
most complete, or probably because it is the most complete, version of <cite>The Arabian
Nights</cite> yet produced. In this first volume we have our old friends the Porter and the
three Ladies of Baghdad, with the three Kalendars, the Hunchback, and the silent Barber.
But one of the most striking of the stories has not appeared in any former edition,—the
tale, namely, of King Omar bin al-Nu’uman and his sons. This is a Moslem chivalrous
romance, with all the characteristics of a mediæval romance founded on the Crusades;
but, of course, the facts are reversed. Instead of a Christian knight falling in love with a
Moslem maiden, and slaughtering her kith and kin by thousands and defeating their
treacherous attempts at murder by violence and stealth, by ambuscade and poison, the
hero is a Moslem prince and knight, and the heroine is a Christian maiden, and the
villains and villainesses are all Christians, and it is the Christians who are slaughtered in
their thousands by his single arm. As in the Christian romances, too, the plot wanders
off from episode to episode, and, it must be admitted, becomes insufferably tedious, for
before the end the grandchildren of the original hero are become the principal personages
of the tale. But the leading incident and the opening episode of Sharrkan and Abrizah
are worthy to rank with the tales of Sigurd and Brynhild. In fact, it may be questioned
whether there is any personage in mediæval romance who outshines the fair
<span class="pageno" id="Page_490">490</span>Amazonian Abrizah in purity and nobility of womanly character, or any more devoted and
chivalrous lover than Sharrkan. But the story does not remain throughout at the same
high level, and the fate of Aurora Leigh, which is inflicted on Abrizah by Sharrkan’s
father (only darkly hinted at in this edition), and her death by the hands of a negro slave,
and the horribly Eastern sufferings that befall Nuzhat al-Zaman, are worse than those
which befell the heroines of Western tales of chivalry, bad as they often are. It would
be interesting to know the origin of this story, which certainly strikes one as out of its
place in the <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>; for though its adventures are many of
them exaggerated and improbable, yet they are more casually connected, more coherent,
and more natural and human and less inverted, than the weird and monstrous incidents of
the true Arabian tales. Among these stand conspicuous the Third Kalendar’s tale, with
its Loadstone Mountain and its man of brass, its castle plated with red gold, and the
inevitable decree of blind Fate; the First Lady’s tale, with its city of stone men; and
above all, the delightful tale of the Fisherman and the Ifreet,—the enchanted city with
its King turned into marble from the waist downwards, and its citizens into white,
red, blue, and yellow fishes that lift up their heads from the frying-pan and recite “verses
in writing.” Assuredly the tales that used to charm one’s childhood have no less charm
with the added anthropological interest which is lent them by Sir Richard Burton’s
translation and notes.</p>

<p class="c027">The well-known and widely appreciated yarns of Sindbad the Seaman and Sindbad
the Landsman are brought to a conclusion. The less familiar but most powerful and
typically Oriental story “The City of Brass” follows and, though we are far from
wishing to join the yelping pack already at Mr. Haggard’s heels, readers of this colossal
conception will feel inclined to agree with Solomon that “there is nothing new under
the sun.”</p>

<p class="c027">The present volume brings us up to the 761st “night,” and, like its predecessors,
contains a number of stories quite unknown to the general reader. It concludes the
history of Sindbad, giving a variant rendering, from the Calcutta edition, of the seventh
voyage, and contains a large number of stories concerning the “Craft and Malice of
Women,” which are of the highest value as illustrations of social conditions, and it has
besides, many tales to which it would be a pleasure to allude individually. * * *
As a translation, it is unequalled in fidelity, and Sir Richard Burton’s familiarity with
Oriental scenes has enabled him to preserve the greater part of the quaint flavour of the
original.</p>

<p class="c027">Bringing us up to the 944th night, this volume includes the curious tale of the “Man
of Upper Egypt and his Frankish Wife,” and others omitted by Lane. One of the
most characteristic of these is that of “King Jali’ad of Hind and his Wazir Shimas,”
which belongs to the oldest series in <cite>The Nights</cite> and has attached to it a number of
animal and other fables, all very remarkable. Lane found the story “puerile,” and it is
very true that from many points of view, it is so; but as an illustration of the ways of
Arabian society and an example of a class of stories largely circulated amongst the
Oriental peoples of that date, it cannot be overlooked, and if read in the proper appreciative
spirit, it is by no means devoid of amusement. The style of the translation, as
we have previously remarked, has a strange archaic charm, and the unusual locutions of
which Sir Richard Burton is master, harmonize admirably with his subject, while the
rhythmic portions, which he has reproduced with so much skill and diversify, render still
more picturesque the whole.</p>

<p class="c027">Several of the stories comprised in this latter group are familiar under other forms
in most parts of Europe, and there are few of them which do not embody the
practical wisdom and the sound and generous moral precepts which are, as a rule,
characteristic of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. Taken in conjunction with the numerous and
excellent notes which the translator has supplied, this version as we have before had
occasion to observe, presents the exact sense of the original Arabic text, which the
fanciful phraseology in which the narratives are expressed largely assists in realising,
while lending an additional charm to the tales themselves. * * * In this
volume are contained, among others, the stories of Hasan of Bassorah, of Khalifah the
Fisherman of Baghdad, of Ali Nur Al-Din and Miriam the Girdle Girl, of the Man of
Upper Egypt and his Frankish Wife, of the Ruined Man of Baghdad and his Slave-Girl,
and the long series of tales, fables and allegories, in which the astrologers and other
wise men variously interpret a dream which had disturbed the great King Jali’ad of
Hind, and on which he had consulted them. Several of the stories comprised in this
latter group are familiar under other forms in most parts of Europe, and there are few
of them which do not embody the practical wisdom and the sound and generous moral
precepts which are, as a rule, characteristic of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. The volume
contains also the interesting history of King Wird Khan, with his women and Wazirs.
This monarch was weak and uxorious, and disregarding the sage counsels of Shimas,
the chief of his Wazirs, pursued a profligate and effeminate career, as the result of
which great troubles arose in his realm, and an extensive conspiracy was formed to get
rid of him. Acting on the suggestion of his favourite wife, he caused his Wazirs,
grandees, and notables to be put to death after the fashion of Eastern despots. The
weakness to which his kingdom was thus reduced tempted aggression by a neighbouring
king, and it was threatened with immediate invasion, rapine, and slaughter. From this
strait he was delivered by the sagacity of a boy whom he had accidentally fallen in with in the
course of a stroll he made <em>incog.</em> one evening through his capital whilst pondering over
his desperate position. The stories introduced in the course of the history contain the
counsel offered him in the successive stages of his difficulty, through which he is at
length conducted in safety and then returns to a more rational course of life. Lane
omits this story as being exceedingly puerile. That judgment will hardly be supported
by the reader when he now reads it. It is one of the two oldest tales in the whole
series of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> as is here pointed out, and at the same time very
<span class="pageno" id="Page_492">492</span>characteristic. Taken in conjunction with the numerous and excellent notes here
supplied, this version, as we have before had occasion to observe, presents the exact
sense of the original Arabic text, which the fanciful phraseology in which the narrative
are expressed largely assists in realising, while lending an additional charm to the tales
themselves.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Glasgow Evening Times</cite>, <em>December 3, 1887</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The third of the five Supplemental volumes of Sir Richard Burton’s translation of
<cite>The Thousand Nights and a Night</cite> is in the hands of the subscribers this week. It
is one of the most interesting, and (we have Sir Richard’s word for it) the most
innocent of the series. It contains some of the best known of the Eastern tales, including
“Aladdin” and “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” which did not find a place either
in Sir Richard Burton’s translation of the <cite>Nights</cite> or in that of Mr. John Payne for the
Villon Society, for the very good reason that they were then unknown except through the
French translation of Galland, and were under suspicion of not being of Eastern origin
at all. The doubts about Galland’s translations have, however, now been removed, for
all his tales have been discovered in Hindustani, and some of them in Arabic under circumstances
which preclude these versions from having been translated from that of the
French writer. In his preface Sir Richard Burton tells the story in detail, but we need
not follow him there. He has now had these old favourites translated afresh, and they form
a fitting pendant to his work. He courts comparison of his translation with the long
popular version of Galland by printing the English translation of the latter’s Aladdin
along with his own. Sir Richard’s notes are, it may be expected, full of curious information.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Academy</cite>, <em>December 10, 1887</em>.</h3>

    <div><cite>THE KAMA SHASTRA SOCIETY.</cite></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Sir Richard F. Burton has just issued to his subscribers the third volume of his
<cite>Supplemental Nights</cite>, the printing of which was delayed through his illness during
the early part of the year. Sir Richard intends to pass the winter at Fiume, where the
climate is less trying than at Trieste. He hopes to come to England in May, bringing
with him the MS. of the fifth and last volume of the <cite>Supplemental Nights</cite>. The fourth
volume is already in the hands of the printers to the Kama Shastra Society.</p>

<p class="c000">The third volume of the <cite>Supplemental Nights</cite> was originally intended to be the
fourth; but the order has been altered on account of the difficulties which Sir Richard
experienced in transcribing the Wortley-Montague MS. in the Bodleian, as narrated by
himself in the <cite>Academy</cite> of November 13, 1886. Students, however, will not regret the
change, in consideration of their delight at here finding for the first time the true Oriental
version of “Aladdin,” which has hitherto only been known through Galland’s French.
As Sir Richard announced in the <cite>Academy</cite> of January 22, 1887, an Arabic original of
“Aladdin” and some other tales was quite recently purchased for the Bibliothèque
Nationale by M. Hermann Zotenberg, who will shortly publish a full bibliographical
description of his discovery. Meanwhile he has placed a copy of the MS. at Sir
Richard’s disposal; and from this the translation of “Aladdin,” or rather, “Allaeddin,”
has been made. “Ali Baba” is another of the most familiar of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
stories for which no Arabic original has yet been found. In order to produce a genuine
Orientalised version of this, Sir Richard has had recourse to the following device. After
much searching in vain among Persian and Turkish MSS., he at last found a Hindustani
<span class="pageno" id="Page_493">493</span>version containing the missing tales, which Mr. J. F. Blumhardt, of Cambridge, helped
to English. He was thus enabled to escape from the plan he had originally contemplated—of
turning Galland’s French into Arabic, and then translating that.</p>

<p class="c000">In addition to these welcome novelties, the volume is noticeable for its bulk, for Sir
Richard generally gives his subscribers more than he promised. We have here the
popular English form of Galland’s “Aladdin,” to compare with the version now first
made from the original Arabic; and also an appendix of about 100 pages, contributed
by Mr. W. A. Clouston, which describes in detail the variants and analogues of all the
tales in the volume.</p>

<p class="c000">In the meantime, the Kama Shastra Society has begun a fresh undertaking—the
production of a literal and unexpurgated translation of three famous Persian works:—(1)
The <cite>Gulistân</cite>, or “Rose Garden,” of Sa’dí (<span class="fss">A.D.</span> 1258), which may be called not
unfamiliar in incomplete versions; (2) the <cite>Nigaristân</cite>, or “Picture Gallery,” of
Mu’in-uddín Jawini (<span class="fss">A.D.</span> 1334), which has never been translated into any Western
language; and (3) the <cite>Behâristân</cite>, or “Abode of Spring,” of Jâmi (<span class="fss">A.D.</span> 1487), of
which one chapter or “garden” was translated a few years ago by Mr. C. E. Wilson,
under the title of <cite>Persian Wit and Humour</cite> (Chatto and Windus, 1883). For a popular
account of these authors and their rank in Persian literature, we may refer our readers to
a little volume published by Mr. Bernard Quaritch in the early part of the present year
called <cite>Persian Portraits</cite>. Of the three translations which the Kama Shastra Society
propose to issue to a very limited number of subscribers, the <cite>Behâristân</cite> of Jâmi—the
latest in date but the greatest in reputation—is now ready. It forms a volume of less
than 200 pages with a few notes.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Morning Post</cite>, <em>March 19, 1888</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As is well shown in this volume, there is as much in the manner of these tales as in
the matter of them. If Oriental fiction delights our fancy by transferring us from the
common places of our workaday life to realms and to communities fairer than any of
which we have daily experience here, any aids from language by which the dominance of
fascination may be maintained are clearly legitimate and useful. That the subject is
worthy of a warm and ornate rendering such as has been bestowed upon it in these
delightful volumes is made abundantly evident from a glance at the splendour of the
Arabian Empire during the period covered by <cite>The Nights</cite> but particularly in the
earlier portion of it.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Athenæum</cite>, <em>May 12, 1888</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Sir Richard Burton’s complete translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> may be considered
the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">magnum opus</span></i> of one who had already added much to his country’s literature
by the record of his own personal travel and adventure. To render the original text of
such a work as <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite> into a European language so as to make the
reader apprehend the style and spirit of the Arabic is necessarily a task demanding
exceptional qualifications; and success in so bold an attempt, were it but partial, would
imply the exercise of more than Oriental scholarship. It could only be achieved by one
who understood, in all shades and phases, the genius and imaginary, the ways and habits,
the tastes and prejudices, the pathos and humour of both Western and Eastern peoples.
Probably there is no Englishman living who could have ventured on the undertaking
with better chances of success than Sir R. Burton.</p>

<p class="c027">The sale of Sir Richard Burton’s uncompromising translation of the <cite>Thousand and
One Nights</cite> was so great that Sir Richard has undertaken to supply five supplementary
volumes. The “copy” has just reached the publishers from Trieste, and the volumes
will be disposed of on the same terms as the early ones—that is to say, by subscription.
The price fixed is pretty high, but so overmastering is the purely literary curiosity in the
matter that not only was the original edition sold to the last copy, but the book is now
at a very considerable premium in the market. Sir Richard Burton proposes to himself
to take a little rest, after which he will commence a work that cannot fail to equal in
interest even the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, and will be much better adapted for appearance on
the drawing-room table. Sir Richard is going to write his autobiography—a work that
will cover one of the most remarkable careers of modern times. The efforts made in
influential quarters to secure an adequate retiring pension for this gallant explorer and man
of letters still prove unavailing, and he goes on with his dull, uncongenial work as Consul
at Trieste—a place in which he has never enjoyed really good health.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The County Gentleman</cite>, <em>October 17th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">How fearfully cold it is, to be sure! My overcoat is neither lined with rabbit skin
nor tipped with astrachan, and I feel the bitter breeze. A friend of mine, who has
subscribed to Captain Burton, tells me that if I carried a copy of the first volume of the
new translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> in my breast-pocket I would find it very warm.
I daresay he is right, but the copies published a month ago at a guinea have gone up in
value to ten. I suppose the reports of a severe winter have sent the work to a premium.
Or, may be, Mr. Stead’s review gives it enhanced value.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">Burton’s new <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is the book of the season. But, strange to say, it is
not to be had at Mudie’s or at Smith’s. Only a thousand copies were issued, and these
went to subscribers. And the owners of a copy of the first volume are already personages
of importance. School-girls cry for the book, and the Social Purity people borrow it
when they can. Inquisitive folk ask everybody if they have seen it, and wonder why
there should be so much fuss made about it. Wags look knowing and give evasive
answers, but the man who tells the truth sayeth in reply, “because it is the highest
book ever printed in English.” The captain is not the only writer that has gone to the
<cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">Burton’s book makes one feel sorry for Rabelais and Stead. Indeed, Rabelais
borrowed from the original, and Burton of immortal Melancholy, like his namesake the
peripatetic captain, knew something of it. The new edition will be prized by a few
students, perhaps, but its chief value in the eyes of many that hold copies of it will be
its high qualities. A few of the volumes were to be had in Holywell-street, but these
have all been bought up at big prices.</p>

<h3 class="c015">“<cite>Jehu Junior</cite>,” <cite class="scite">Vanity Fair</cite>, <em>October 24th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As a bold, astute traveller, courting danger, despising hardship, and compelling
fortune, Captain Burton has few equals; as a master of Oriental languages, manners
and customs he has none. He is still very young, very vigorous, very full of anecdote
and playful humour, and, what is remarkable in a linguist, he has not disdained even his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_495">495</span>own mother tongue, which he handles with a precision and a power that few can
approach. He has recently crowned his literary labours by the most complete,
laborious, uncompromising, and perfect translation of that collection of stories known
to us as <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>, but more correctly called <em>A Thousand Nights and a Night</em>.
He is a wonderful man.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Whitehall Review</cite>, <em>October 29th, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The second volume of Captain Burton’s translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> has just
been issued to the subscribers, who had already become impatient for a second instalment
of this great and fascinating contribution to literature. The new volume is, if possible,
of even greater interest than the first. It contains the whole of the fantastic semi-chivalrous
story of King Omar Bin al-Nu’-uman and his sons Sharrkan and Zau
al-Makan, a knowledge of which has hitherto been confined chiefly to Oriental scholars,
as Lane only admitted an episode from it into his version of <cite>Alif Laïla</cite>. Some of
Sharrkan’s adventures will remind students of other Eastern stories of some of the
adventures recorded of the hero of Persian romance, Hatim Taï. As usual, Captain
Burton’s notes are rich, varied, and copious, of the greatest service to all serious students
of Arabic manners and customs, and of Oriental life in general. * * *</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Apropos</em> of Captain Burton’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>, a silly story is going the round of
some of the newspapers to the effect that some idiot, or company of idiots, intend to
address a solemn appeal to Captain Burton to cease the publication of his work. A
virtuous journal like the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> has been shocked by its Oriental freedom of
speech, and it and its readers are prepared to denounce Captain Burton up hill and down
dale for the crime of translating into accurate English a great Arabic masterpiece. How
silly, how vulgar, how uneducated such a cry is must be obvious to any one who has
made any study, no matter how limited, of any of the great literatures of the world
compared to Rabelais, compared to Boccaccio, compared to La Fontaine, the <cite>Arabian
Nights</cite> of Captain Burton might almost be recommended as a study for a Sunday-school.
We have chosen for our examples authors all of whose works are familiarly studied and
easily obtainable. It would be childish to compare Captain Burton’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>
with other works which we could mention, which are, luckily, less generally known and
also, luckily, less generally obtainable; while to compare the morality of these new
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> with the <cite>Pall Mall Gazette</cite> itself would be comparing the waters of the
Mediterranean with ditchwater.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">South Eastern Herald</cite>, <em>October 31st, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">At Mr. Quaritch’s trade sale the other day, Captain Burton made an interesting
speech regarding <cite>The Thousand and One Nights</cite>, of which the gist was to show that his
translation performs a double office. It is not only a faithful and racy version of the
true original, but it also represents a better text than any which has been hitherto
accessible in print or manuscript. He, in fact, produced for his own use, and by
collation of the existing materials, a careful, critical recension of the original; and his
rendering may, therefore, claim to stand towards the <cite>Alf Laïlah</cite> in the same manner as
the Latin version of Plato, by Marsilius Ficinus, towards the Greek text.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Angler’s Journal</cite>, <em>November 21st, 1885</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">To such of my brother anglers as consider something warm a necessity when pursuing
their sport during the winter months, I confidently recommend the latest edition of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_496">496</span><cite>Thousand and One Nights</cite>, done into English by Captain Burton. There is no pandering
to pretended prudery in this work, which is the only translation extant calculated to give
one a true idea of the many subtle and hitherto unexpressed beauties of the original.
This book is the more welcome from the fact of our having been lately flooded with
abridged and castrated editions of the English and other classics; for, as a matter of
fact, the excised portions are the only parts of such books that the British public cares to
read. But what has all this to do with fishing? I fancy I hear some of my readers
indulging in expletives, and language which is best expressed by the natural divisions of
these paragraphs.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Morning Post</cite>, <em>January 19th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Everything comes to him who waits—even the long-promised, eagerly expected
“Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights,” by Richard F. Burton. It is a
whole quarter of a century since this translation of one of the most famous books of the
world was contemplated, and we are told it is the natural outcome of the well-known
pilgrimage to Medinah and Mecca. Of Captain Burton’s fitness for the task who can
doubt? It was during that celebrated journey to the Tomb of the Prophet that he
proved himself to be an Arab—indeed, he says, in a previous state of existence he was
a Bedouin. Did he not for months at a stretch lead the life of a Son of the Faithful,
eat, drink, sleep, dress, speak, pray, like his brother devotees, the sharpest eyes failing
to pierce his disguise? He knows the ways of Eastern men—and women—as he does
the society of London or Trieste. How completely at home he is with his adopted
brethren he showed at Cairo, when, to the amazement of some English friends who were
looking on at the noisy devotions of some “howling” Dervishes, he suddenly joined
the shouting, gesticulating circle, and behaved as if to the manner born. He has
qualified as a “howler,” he holds a diploma as a master Dervish, and he can
initiate disciples. Clearly, to use a phrase of Arabian story, it was decreed by Allah
from the beginning—and fate and fortune have arranged—that Captain Burton should
be the one of all others to confer upon his countrymen the boon of the genuine
unsophisticated <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>. In the whole of our literature no
book is more widely known. It is spread broadcast like the Bible, Bunyan, and
Shakespeare: yet although it is in every house, and every soul in the kingdom knows
something about it, yet nobody knows it as it really exists. We have only had what
translators have chosen to give—selected, diluted, and abridged transcripts. And of
late some so-called “original” books have been published, containing minor tales
purloined bodily from the <cite>Nights</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Bat</cite>, <em>February 8th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Indeed of those who know the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> as they really are, there are
three classes and only three. First, there are those who have read the translation
by Mr. John Payne, a book with many faults, but which has the merit of being the
first complete translation in any language. Secondly, those who know the Alif Laila
in its original text; whether that text be Macnaughten’s, Habicht’s, or the Boulak
version. Thirdly, and best of all, those who know the translation by Sir Richard
Burton, an immortal addition to English literature, and the most priceless contribution
to Oriental knowledge that has been made for a century. To the serious student of
the East and of all things Eastern, Sir Richard Burton’s translation is in itself a very
<span class="pageno" id="Page_497">497</span>Alexandrian library of rare, curious, unparalleled knowledge, the Knowledge, that can
only be obtained and given again by a man of letters, who is also in the widest sense a
man of the world. But Sir Richard Burton’s translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> is a book
for men and not for all men. It is the text-book and the treasure-house of scholars;
but it is not for every-day readers; and above all things, and inevitably, it is not for
woman-kind. No woman could read, was ever meant to read Sir Richard Burton’s
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite>.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Court Society</cite>, <em>March 4th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">Not a little disgust has been excited by the vulgar sneer which a morning paper
has indulged in at the expense of Sir Richard Burton. Long neglected by successive
Governments, Captain Burton received, after 44 years, a tardy recognition of his services.
Straightway, it was suggested that he is made a knight because he translated
the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. It need scarcely be said that his translation has nothing to
do with the distinction conferred upon him, but as it is the habit in a certain quarter
to denounce the literal translation of the <cite>Nights</cite>, it cannot be too distinctly understood
that Captain Burton never meant his work to fall into any hands save those of a
thousand students.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Sporting Life</cite>, <em>April 12th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The first two of the five volumes of “Supplemental Nights to the Book or the
Thousand Nights and a Night, with Notes Anthropological and Explanatory,” have been
issued privately to subscribers, whereof there will be no more than a thousand. We have
Sir Richard F. Burton’s pledge. The tales are peculiarly interesting, and are told in
English of matchless flavour and force. Volume iii. is dedicated to Mr. Henry Irving in
these words: “My dear Irving, To a consummate artist like yourself, I need hardly
suggest that <cite>The Nights</cite> still offers many a virgin mine to the Playwright: and I
ascribe this volume to you, not only in admiration of your genius, but in the hope of
that you will find means of exploiting the hidden wealth which awaits only your ‘Open
Sesame!’—Ever yours sincerely, Richard F. Burton.” This is a pregnant hint. As I
have before observed, the vast majority of readers of the Englished lore of the East knew
worse than nothing of that marvellous storehouse of romance, <cite>The Arabian Nights</cite>
until Sir Richard Burton opened it for them. There are countless dramas embodied in
the <cite>Nights</cite>, and one cannot wonder that Sir Richard Burton should desire to see some
of them shaped for the stage at the instance of his friend Mr. Irving. I may mention
here that the third volume of Lady Burton’s edition of the Nights is available. It is as
dainty as its predecessors, as well done in point of literary workmanship, and as full of
matter.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Whitehall Review</cite>, <em>May 24th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The sixth volume of Sir Richard Burton’s <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> which has just been
issued to subscribers, is one of the most interesting of the series to Anglo-Orientalists.
For it contains that story—or set of stories—which is, perhaps, of all the tales of the
<cite>Arabian Nights</cite> the dearest to legend-loving mankind, whether Oriental or Occidental—the
story of the voyages of “Sindbad the Sailor,” or of “Sindbad the Seaman,” as
Sir Richard Burton prefers to call him. Perhaps the only tale which at all competes
in popularity with the wandering record of the “Eastern Odysseus” is the story of “Ali
<span class="pageno" id="Page_498">498</span>Baba,” and that, unfortunately, does not belong to the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> at all, and can
only, as far as we know, be traced to a modern Greek origin. Lovers of the story
of “Sindbad the Sailor” will be pleased to learn that their old friend remains to all
intents and purposes the same in Sir Richard’s literal Translation as he was in the fanciful
adaptation of Galland, and the more accurate rendering of Lane. He does not
“suffer a sea change,” but remains, what he has always been, the most wonderful
wanderer in the whole range and region of romance. Sir Richard Burton’s sixth volume
contains, besides, that story of the “Seven Viziers” which in so many forms is a
favourite in all the languages of the East.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">The Bat</cite>, <em>July 7th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">As regards his translation, however, Captain Burton is certainly felicitous in the
manner in which he has Englished the picturesque turns of the original. One great
improvement in this version over that of Mr. Lane will be found in the fact that the
verses so freely interspersed throughout the <cite>Nights</cite> are here rendered in metre, and
that an attempt also has often been made to preserve the assonants and the monorhyme
of the Arabic. Mr. Lane frankly stated that he omitted the greater part of the poetry as
tedious, and, through the loss of measure and rhyme “generally intolerable to the
reader,” as, in truth, the specimens inserted mostly proved to be on account of the bald
literalism of the rendering. Captain Burton has naturally inserted the poetry with the
rest; and has often shown much skill in doing into English verse the rippling couplets
of the original. Take, as an instance, the verses which Mr. Lane renders:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Tell him who is oppressed with anxiety that anxiety will not last.</div>
      <div class="line">As happiness passeth away, so passeth away anxiety.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Almost equally literal, and certainly more poetical, is Captain Burton, who gracefully
turns this:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Tell whoso hath sorrow, Grief never shall last;</div>
      <div class="line">E’en as Joy hath no morrow, so woe shall go past.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And since, in proverbs and epigrams, so much depends on the form, the spirit of the
original is well observed, when, for instance, we read in a certain chronicle the lines of
one Ibn al Sumam:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Hold fast thy secret, and to none unfold;</div>
      <div class="line">Lost is a secret when that secret’s told.</div>
      <div class="line">And fail thy breast thy secret to conceal,</div>
      <div class="line">How canst thou hope another’s breast shall hold?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Doubtless, too—and in this not following Mr. Lane—Captain Burton is right in
retaining the original division into Nights: for, as he justly observes, “Without the
Nights, no Arabian Nights!” And, besides this being a prime feature of the original,
a grateful pause is thereby introduced into these intricate and interminable stories. In
the translation Captain Burton’s English is generally picturesque and always fluent. As
it is frankly stated, too, has “never hesitated to coin a word when wanted.” Captain
Burton, who has passed the greater portion of his life in Arab-speaking countries, mixing
freely in Moslem society, and often passing—as during his pilgrimage—himself for a True
Believer, is naturally well qualified to translate this “Great Eastern Saga-Book.”
Also, since the scene of the stories is laid successively in every country of Islam, from
Tangier to India, and beyond, the translator’s intimate acquaintance, made during his
wanderings, with all these people and places, stands him in good stead in elucidating
peculiar manners and customs, and in this gives him the advantage over Mr. Lane, who
had only seen Islam as domiciled in Egypt.</p>

</div>

<p class="c027">There has been such a delay between the issue of the sixth and that of the seventh
volume of “Alf Laylah wa Laylah,” or “The Book of the Thousand Nights and a
Night,” “the private subscribers only” to that marvellous work were beginning to
wonder whether anything had happened to Sir Richard F. Burton to put a stop to his
undertaking. At any rate, one private subscriber wondered, the more especially as many
threats had been breathed by self-imposed keepers of the public conscience (journalists,
of course), with regard to putting an end to the publication. To make up for the delay,
the eighth, as well as the seventh, volume has been issued. One of the dedications is
peculiar. It is encased in a mourning border, and runs thus:—“A Message to Frederick
Hankey, formerly of No. 2, Rue Lafitte, Paris.—My dear Fred,—If there is such a
thing as ‘continuation,’ you will see these lines in the far spirit-land, and you will find
that your old friend has not forgotten you and Annie.” It is evident from this that the
great African and Asian traveller has leanings towards a belief in spiritualism.</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">The more I see of this splendid translation, the more do I feel that we are indebted
to the translator (after Mr. Payne) for the first real idea, in English, of the immortal
original, and to him alone for a complete reflection of the Arabian Nights. The lustre
and vigour of the English compel one’s admiration at every step. In justification whereof
I cite a couple of brief passages from the first few pages in the seventh volume:—“The
first to open the door of war was Kurajan, who cried out, saying, ‘Let no coward come
out to me this day, nor craven!’ Whereupon Jamrkan and Sa’adan stood by the
colours, but there ran at him a captain of the Banu Amir, and the two drave at each other
awhile like two rams butting. Presently Kurajan seized the Moslem by the jerkin under
his hauberk, and dragging him from his saddle, dashed him to the ground, where he left
him, upon which the Kafirs laid hands on him and bound him and bore him off to their
tents, whilst Kurajan wheeled about and careered and offered battle till another captain
came out, whom also he took prisoner, nor did he leave to do thus till he had made prize
of seven captains before midday.”</p>

<hr class="c035" />

<p class="c000">Again: “He cried out to his folk, ‘At him all at once and assault him with one
assault.’ Accordingly they waved the awe-striking banners, and host was heaped on
host; Gharib rushed on with his men, and Jamrkan did the same, and the two sides met
like two seas together clashing. The Yamani sword and spear wrought havoc, and
breasts and bellies were rent, whilst both armies saw the Angel of Death face to face, and
the dust of the battle rose to the skirts of the sky. Ears went deaf and tongues went
dumb, and doom from every side came on, whilst valiant stood fast and faint heart fled;
and they ceased not from fight and fray till ended the day, when the drums beat the
retreat and the two hosts drew apart and returned, each to its tents.” Is not that
spirited? It is palpable enough that, until Sir Richard Burton’s wonderful work saw
the light, we had no “Arabian Nights.”</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Nottingham Journal</cite>, <em>August 30th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The sales of Sir Richard Burton’s most realistic version of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> (a
very valuable book in its way, but distinctly a top-shelf one) appear to have gone off
with uncommon briskness; with so much briskness, in fact, that Sir Richard has taken
in hand to prepare for publication a series of additional tales from the same source.
Five new volumes called <cite>Supplemental Nights</cite> are in preparation, and I understand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_500">500</span>that the first two are completed. It is no disparagement to the scholarly labours of the
editor to suggest that one may have too much Arabian Nights Entertainment. The
translation of the original work, a unique performance, will always be valued by students
and collectors (I am told that it is already worth double the price it was issued at), but
a second series might possibly pall.</p>

<h3 class="c015"><cite class="scite">Whitehall Gazette</cite>, <em>August 5th, 1886</em>.</h3>

<p class="c027">The current number of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite> contains an article of a somewhat
foolish kind upon the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>. That great collection of Eastern stories is
receiving a great deal of very deserved attention just now, and any literary contribution
to the question is of interest. But the <cite>Edinburgh</cite> Reviewer does not add much of value
to the matter in hand. A considerable part of his paper is devoted to a very acrid,
unjust, and ill-mannered attack upon Sir Richard Burton’s famous translation. Quite
apart from the question of tastes which the paper raises—though whether the <cite>Edinburgh
Review</cite> is necessarily an impeccable authority as to taste is at least open to question—the
attack on Sir Richard Burton’s rendering is animated by an obvious spirit of small
antagonism which puts it out of court at once as a critical essay. To jump upon some
small inaccuracy and trumpet over it like the foolish cock in the fable will scarcely
detract from the admiration which all Orientalists feel for Sir Richard Burton, nor in
any way lessen his fame as one of the profoundest and the most remarkable Oriental
students of his time. The <cite>Edinburgh</cite> Reviewer is also pleased to be sarcastic over a
reference to D’Herbelot. Does the reviewer really think that D’Herbelot is altogether
out of date because he happened not to have been published in the latter part of the
nineteenth century and under the patronage of the <cite>Edinburgh Review</cite>? However,
Sir Richard Burton’s translation of the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> will endure as a standard
contribution to Oriental literature, in spite of the disapproval of its latest critic.</p>

the Sage went behind the Palace and drove through a mound or heap of earth a narrow
hole bearing east-west, which he partially filled up with sand; and so when the sun rose
the beams fell upon it and made it resemble a newly made cord of white flax. M. Agoub

seems to me to be, and I believe this is also the meaning of M. Houdas, that Haykar
produced streaks of light in an otherwise dark room by boring holes in the back wall,
and scattered the sand over them, so that, while passing through the rays of the sun, it
assumed the appearance of ropes. Hence he says mockingly to Pharaoh, “Have

en Arabe harquebuse, Albondoukani signifie l’arquebusier; c’était comme on le voit, le
mot d’ordre du Khalyfe.</span></i> He supposes, then, that firelocks were known in the days of
Harun al-Rashid (A.D. 786–809). Al-Bundukáni = the cross-bow man, or rather the
man of the pellet-bow was, according to the Ráwí, the name by which the Caliph was
known in this disguise. Al-Zahir Baybars al-Bundukdárí, the fourth Baharite Soldan
(A.D. 1260–77) was so entitled because he had been a slave to a Bundukdár, an officer
who may be called the Grand Master of Artillery. In Chavis and Cazotte the Caliph
arms himself with a spear, takes a bow and arrow (instead of the pellet-bow that named
him), disguises his complexion, dyes beard and eyebrows, dons a large coarse
turband, a buff waistcoat with a broad leathern belt, a short robe of common stuff and
half-boots of strong coarse leather, and thus “assumes the garb of an Arab from the
desert.” (!)</p>

me in Pilg. i. 226, (where my indexer called it “sand goose”) and in The Nights
(vols. i. 131; iv. 111). De Sacy (Chrestom. Arab. iii. pp. 416, 507–509) offers a good
literary account of it: of course he cannot speak from personal experience. He begins
with the Ajáib al-Makhlúkát by Al-Kazwini (ob. A.H. 674 = A.D. 1274) who tells us
that the bird builds in the desert a very small nest (whence the Hadís, “Whoso shall build
to Allah a mosque, be it only the bigness of a Katá’s nest, the Lord shall edify for him
a palace in Paradise”); that it abandons its eggs which are sometimes buried in sand,
and presently returns to them (hence the saying, “A better guide than the Katá”);
that it watches at night (?) and that it frequents highways to reconnoitre travellers (??),
an interpretation confirmed by the Persian translator. Its short and graceful steps
gave rise to the saying, “She hath the gait of a Katá,” and makes De Sacy confound
the bird with the Pers. Káhú or Kabk-i-dari (partridge of the valley) which
is simply the francolin, the Ital. francolino, a perdix. The latter in Arab. is
“Durráj” (Al-Mas’udi, vii. 347): see an affecting story connected with it in the
Suppl. Nights, ii. 59–62. In the xxiii<sup>d</sup> Ass. of Al-Hariri the sagacity of the Katá
is alluded to, “I crossed rocky places, to which the Katá would not find its
way.” See also Ass. viii. But Mr. Chenery repeats a mistake when he says (p. 339)
that the bird is “never found save where there is good pasturage and water:” it
haunts the wildest parts of Sind and Arabia, although it seldom strays further than
60 miles from water which it must drink every evening. I have never shot the
Katá since he saved my party from a death by thirst on a return-ride from Harar
(First Footsteps in E. Africa, p. 388). The bird is very swift with a skurrying flight
like a frightened pigeon; and it comes to water regularly about dusk when it is
easily “potted.”</p>

This is he concerning whom Allah decreed (that he should be my portion, swearing;)

In “kasama” the three ideas of decreeing, giving as a share, and binding one’s self by
oath are blended together. If it should appear out of place to introduce Divinity itself
as speaking in this context, we must not forget that the person spoken of is no less
illustrious individual than Harun al-Rashíd, and that a decidedly satirical and humorous
vein runs through the whole tale. Moreover, I doubt that “li-ahad” could be used as
equivalent for “li-ghayrí,” “to some other than myself,” while it frequently occurs in
the emphatic sense of “one who is somebody, a person of consequence.” The damsel

strict correctness. It is a forename or bye-name generally taken from the favourite son,
Abú (father of) being prefixed. When names are written in full it begins the string, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>,
Abu Mohammed (forename), Kásim (true name), ibn Ali (father’s name), ibn Mohammed
(grandfather’s), ibn Osman (great-grandfather), Al-Hariri (=the Silkman from the craft
of the family), Al-Basri (of Bassorah). There is also the “Lakab” (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i>), <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>
Al-Bundukání or Badí’u ’l-Zamán (Rarity of the Age), which may be placed either before
or after the “Kunyah” when the latter is used alone. Chenery (Al-Hariri, p. 315)
confines the “Kunyah” to forenames beginning with Abú; but it also applies to those
formed with Umm (mother), Ibn (son), Bint (daughter), Akh (brother) and Ukht (sister).
See vol iv. 287. It is considered friendly and graceful to address a Moslem by this
bye-name.—Gaudent prænomine molles Auriculæ.</p>

opened and read the epistle here given by mistake to the wrong man. Mutalammis, a poet
of The Ignorance, had this <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sobriquet</span></i> (the “frequent asker,” or, as we should say, the
Solicitor-General), his name being Jarír bin ’Abd al-Masíh. He was uncle to Tarafah of
the Mu’allakah or prize-poem, a type of the witty dissolute bard of the jovial period
before Al-Islam arose to cloud and dull man’s life. One day as he was playing with other
children Mutalammis was reciting a panegyric upon his favourite camel, which ran:—</p>

<p class="c012">I mount a he-camel, dark-red and firm-fleshed; or a she-camel of Himyar, fleet of foot
and driving the pebbles with her crushing hooves.</p>

<p class="c000">“See the he-camel turned to a she,” cried the boy, and the phrase became proverbial
to express inelegant transition (Arab. Prov. ii. 246). The uncle bade his nephew put
out his tongue and seeing it dark-coloured said, “That black tongue will be thy ruin!”
Tarafah, who was presently entitled Ibn al-’Ishrín (the son of twenty years), grew
up a model reprobate who cared nothing save for three things, “to drink the dark-red
wine foaming as the water mixeth with it, to urge into the fight a broad-backed steed,
and to while away the dull day with a young beauty.” His apology for wilful waste is
highly poetic:—</p>

At last uncle and nephew fled from ruin to the Court of ’Amrú bin Munzír III., King of
Hira, who in the tale of Al-Mutalammis and his wife Umaymah (The Nights, vol. v. 74)
is called Al-Nu’umán bin Munzir but is better known as ’Amrú bin Hind (his mother).
The King who was a ferocious personage nicknamed Al-Muharrik or the Burner because
he had thrown into the fire ninety-nine men and one woman of the Tamím tribe in
accordance with a vow of vengeance he had taken to slaughter a full century, made the
two strangers boon-companions to his boorish brother Kábús. Tarafah, offended because
kept at the tent-door whilst the master drank wine within, bitterly lampooned him together
with ’Abd Amrú a friend of the King; and when this was reported his death was
determined upon. Amrú, the King, seeing the anxiety of the two poets to quit his Court,
offered them letters of introduction to Abú Kárib, Governor of Al-Hajar (Bahrayn) under
the Persian King and they were accepted. The uncle caused his letter to be read by
a youth, and finding that it was an order for his execution destroyed it and fled to
Syria; but the nephew was buried alive. Amrú, the King, was afterwards slain by the
poet-warrior, Amrú bin Kulthum, also of the “Mu’allakát,” for an insult offered
to his mother by Hind: hence the proverb, “Quicker to slay than ’Amrú bin Kulsum”
(A.P. ii. 233).</p>

exercise in the East as it was in middle-aged Europe. The riddle or conundrum
began, as far as we know, with the Sphinx, through whose mouth the Greeks spoke:
nothing less likely than that the grave and mysterious Scribes of Egypt should ascribe
aught so puerile to the awful emblem of royal majesty—Abu Haul, the Father of
Affright. Josephus relates how Solomon propounded enigmas to Hiram of Tyre which
none but Abdimus, son of the captive Abdæmon, could answer. The Tale of Tawaddud
offers fair specimens of such exercises, which were not disdained by the most learned
of Arabian writers. See Al-Hariri’s Ass. xxiv. which proposes twelve enigmas involving
abstruse and technical points of Arabic, such as: (¿) “What be the word, which as ye
will is a particle beloved, or the name of that which compriseth the slender-waisted
milch camel?” Na’am = “Yes” or “cattle,” the latter word containing the Harf,
or slender camel. Chenery, p. 246.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r197">197</a>.  </span>This is the nursery version of the Exodus, old as Josephus and St. Jerome, and
completely changed by the light of modern learning. The Children of Israel quitted
their homes about Memphis (as if a large horde of half-nomadic shepherds would be
suffered in the richest and most crowded home of Egypt). They marched by the Wady
Músà that debouches upon the Gulf of Suez a short way below the port now temporarily
ruined by its own folly and the ill-will of M. de Lesseps; and they made the “Sea of
Sedge” (Suez Gulf) through the valley bounded by what is still called Jabal ’Atákah,
the Mountain of Deliverance, and its parallel range, Abu Durayj (of small steps). Here
the waters were opened and the host passed over to the “Wells of Moses,” erstwhile
a popular picnic place on the Arabian side; but according to one local legend (for
which see my Pilgrimage, i. 294–97) they crossed the sea north of Túr, the spot being still
called “Birkat Far’aun” = Pharaoh’s Pool. Such also is the modern legend amongst
the Arabs, who learned their lesson from the Christians (not from the Jews) in the days
when the Copts and the Greeks (ivth century) invented “Mount Sinai.” And the
reader will do well to remember that the native annalists of Ancient Egypt, which
conscientiously relate all her defeats and subjugations by the Ethiopians, Persians, etc.,
utterly ignore the very name of Hebrew, Sons of Israel, etc.</p>

<p class="c000">I cannot conceal my astonishment at finding a specialist journal like the “Quarterly
Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund” (Oct., 1887), admitting such a paper as
that entitled “The Exode,” by R. F. Hutchinson, M.D. For this writer the labours
of the last half-century are non-existing. Job is still the “oldest book” in the world.
The Rev. Charles Forster’s absurdity, “Israel in the wilderness” gives valuable
assistance. Goshen is Mr. Chester’s Tell Fakús (not, however, far wrong in this) instead
of the long depression by the Copts still called “Gesem” or “Gesemeh,” the frontierland
through which the middle course of the Suez Canal runs. “Succoth,” tabernacles,
is confounded with the Arab. “Sakf” = a roof. Letopolis, the “key of the Exode,”
and identified with the site where Babylon (Old Cairo) was afterwards built, is placed
on the right instead of the left bank of the Nile. “Bahr Kulzum” is the “Sea of the
Swallowing-up,” in lieu of The Closing. El-Tíh, “the wandering,” is identified with
Wady Musa to the west of the Suez Gulf. And so forth. What could the able Editor
have been doing?</p>

<p class="c000">Students of this still disputed question will consult “The Shrine of Saft el-Henneh

<div class="footnote" id="f198">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r198">198</a>.  </span>Eastern fable runs wild upon this subject, and indeed a large volume could be written
upon the birth, life and death of Moses’ and Aaron’s rods. There is a host of legends
concerning the place where the former was cut and whence it descended to the Prophet
whose shepherd’s staff was the glorification of his pastoral life (the rod being its symbol)
and of his future career as a ruler (and flogger) of men. In Exodus (viii. 3–10), when a
miracle was required of the brothers, Aaron’s rod became a “serpent” (A.V.) or, as some
prefer, a “crocodile,” an animal worshipped by certain of the Egyptians; and when
the King’s magicians followed suit it swallowed up all others. Its next exploit was
to turn the Nile and other waters of Egypt into blood (Exod. vii. 17). The third
wonder was worked by Moses’ staff, the dividing of the Red Sea (read the Sea of Sedge
or papyrus, which could never have grown in the brine of the Suez Gulf) according to
the command, “Lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea,” etc.
(Exod. xiv. 15). The fourth adventure was when the rod, wherewith Moses smote the
river, struck two blows on the rock in Horeb and caused water to come out of it
(Numb. xxi. 8). Lastly the rod (this time again Aaron’s) “budded and brought forth
buds and bloomed blossoms and yielded almonds” (Numb. xvii. 7); thus becoming a
testimony against the rebels: hence it was set in the Holiest of the Tabernacles (Heb.
ix. 14) as a lasting memorial. I have described (Pilgrim. i. 301) the mark of Moses’ rod
at the little Hammam behind the old Phœnician colony of Tur, in the miscalled
“Sinaitic” Peninsula: it is large enough to act mainmast for a ship. The end of the
rod or rods is unknown: it died when its work was done, and like many other things,
holy and unholy, which would be priceless, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, the true Cross or Pilate’s sword, it
remains only as a memory around which a host of grotesque superstitions have grouped

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r234">234</a>.  </span>MS. pp. 505–537. This story is found in the “Turkish Tales” by Petis de la
Croix who translated one fourth of the “Forty Wazirs” by an author self-termed
“Shaykh Zádeh.” It is called the “History of Chec Chahabeddin” (Shaykh Shiháb
al-Dín), and it has a religious significance proving that the Apostle did really and
personally make the “Mi’raj” (ascent to Heaven) and returned whilst his couch was
still warm and his upset gugglet had not run dry. The tale is probably borrowed
from Saint Paul who (2 Cor. xii. 4), was “caught up into Paradise,” which in those
days was a kind of region that roofed the earth. The Shaykh in question began by
showing the Voltairean Sultan of Egypt certain specious miracles, such as a phantom
army (in our tale two lions), Cairo reduced to ashes, the Nile in flood and a Garden of
Irem, where before lay a desert. He then called for a tub, stripped the King to a zone
girding his loins and made him dip his head into the water. Then came the adventures
as in the following tale. When after a moment’s space these ended, the infuriated
Sultan gave orders to behead the Shaykh, who also plunged his head into the tub; but
the Wizard divined the ill-intent by “Mukáshafah” (thought-reading); and by “Al-Ghayb
’an al-Absár” (invisibility) levanted to Damascus. The reader will do well to
compare the older account with the “First Vizir’s Story” (p. 17) in Mr. Gibb’s
“History of the Forty Vizirs,” etc. As this scholar remarks, the Mi’ráj, with all its
wealth of wild fable, is simply alluded to in a detached verset of the Koran (xvii. 1)
which runs: [I declare] “The glory of Him who transported His servant by night from the
Sacred Temple (of Meccah) to the Remote Temple (of Jerusalem), whose precincts we
have blessed, that we might show him of our signs.” After this comes an allusion to
Moses (v. 2); Mr. Gibb observes (p. 22) that this lengthening out of the seconds was a
favourite with “Dervishes,” as he has shown in “The Story of Jewád;” and suggests
that the effect might have been produced by some drug like Hashish. I object to Mr.
Gibb’s use of the word “Houri” (ibid. p. 24) without warning the reader that it is
an irregular formation, masculine withal, for “Huríyah” and that the Pers. “Húrí,”
from which the Turks borrowed their blunder, properly means “One Húr.”</p>

Cow) 48; vii. (Al-Aaráf) 146; S. liv. (Women) 152; but especially in S. xx. (Tá
Há) 90, where Sámiri is expressly mentioned. Most Christian commentators translate
this by “Samaritan” and unjustly note it as “a grievous ignorance of history on the part
of Mohammed.” But the word is mysterious and not explained. R. Jehuda (followed
by Geiger) says upon the text (Exod. xxxii. 24), “The calf came forth lowing and the
Israelites beheld it;” also that “Samael entered into it and lowed in order to mislead
Israel” (Pirke R. Eliezer, § 45). Many Moslems identify Samiri with Micha
(Judges xvii.), who is said to have assisted in making the calf (Raschi, Sanhedr. cii. 2;
Hottinger, Hist. Orient. p. 84). Selden (de Diis Syr. Syn. 1 cap. 4) supposes that
Samiri is Aaron himself, the <em>Shomeer</em> or keeper of Israel during the absence of Moses.
Mr. Rodwell (Koran, 2nd Edit. p. 90) who cleaves to the “Samaritan” theory, writes,
“It is probable (?) that the name and its application, in the present instance, is to be
traced to the old national feud between the Jews and the Samaritans”—of which
Mohammed, living amongst the Jews, would be at least as well informed as any modern
European. He quotes De Sacy (Chrest. i. 189) who states that Abú Rayhán Mohammed
Birúni represents the Samaritans as being nicknamed (not Al-limsahsit as Mr. Rodwell
has it, but) “Lá Mesas” or “Lá Mesásiyah” = the people who say “no touch” (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i>
touch me not, from Súrah xx. 97); and Juynboll, Chron. Sam. p. 113 (Leid. 1848).
Josephus (Ant. xii. cap. 1) also mentions a colony of Samaritans settled in Egypt by
Ptolemy Lagus, some of whose descendants inhabited Cairo as late as temp. Scaliger (De
Emend. Temp. vii. 622). Sale notices a similar survival on one of the islands of the
Red Sea. In these days the Samaritans or, as their enemies call them, the Cuthim
(“men from Cutha,” Cushites), in physical semblance typical Jews, are found only at
Náblús where the colony has been reduced by intermarriage of cousins and the consequent
greater number of male births to about 120 souls. They are, like the Shi’ah Moslems,
careful to guard against ceremonial pollution: hence the epithet “Noli me tangere.”</p>

(camel’s or dog’s), prepared as parchment for writing; and Al-Jafr, the book here in
question, is described as a cabalistic prognostication of all that will ever happen to the
Moslems. The authorship is attributed to Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet. There are
many legendary tales concerning its contents; however, all are mere inventions as the
book is supposed to be kept in the Prophet’s family, nor will it be fully explained until
the Mahdi or Forerunner of Doomsday shall interpret its difficulties. The vulgar Moslems
of India are apt to confuse Al-Jafr with Ja’afar bin Tayyár, the Jinni who is often
quoted in talismans (see Herklots, pp. 109–257). D’Herbelot gives the sum of what

barbarous punishment but it is highly effective, which after all is its principal object.
Old Mohammed Ali of Egypt never could have subjugated and disciplined the ferocious
Badawi of Al-Asir, the Ophir region South of Al-Hijáz without the free use of the stake.
The banditti dared to die but they could not endure the idea of their bodies being torn
to pieces and devoured by birds and beasts. The stake commonly called “Kházúk,” is
a stout pole pointed at one end, and the criminal being thrown upon his belly is held firm
whilst the end is passed up his fundament. His legs and body are then lashed to it and
it is raised by degrees and planted in a hole already dug, an agonising part of the process.
If the operation be performed by an expert who avoids injuring any mortal part, the
wretch may live for three days suffering the pangs of thirst; but a drink of water causes
hemorrhage and instant death. This was the case with the young Moslem student who
murdered the excellent Marshal Kleber in the garden attached to Shepherd’s Hotel,
Cairo, wherein, by the by he suffered for his patriotic crime. Death as in crucifixion is
brought on by cramps and nervous exhaustion, for which see Canon Farrar (Life of
Christ, ii. 392 et seqq.).</p>

Asia, as in the south. We meet with them in Siberia, and they are particularly common
in Lapland. I believe, too that the Indian story of the Red Swan, (referred to by
Longfellow, Hiawatha, xii.) is only a Swan Maiden legend in a rather modified form.
As usual, we find a bizarre form of the Swan Maiden story among the Samoghitians of
Lithuania. The Zemyne is a one-eyed venomous snake, with black blood which cures
all diseases and neutralises all magic. It is an enchanted maiden; and sometimes the
skin has been stolen, and she has married a man. But if she recovers her skin, she
resumes her snake-form, and bites and kills her husband and children. Many other
strange things are related of the Zemyne (Veckenstedt, Mythen, Sagen, und Legenden
der Zamaiten, ii., pp. 149–152).</p>

contemptuously to dismiss the summons. Englishmen are no longer what they were

<div class="footnote" id="f448">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r448">448</a>.  </span>It may serve the home-artist and the home-reader to point out a few of the most
erroneous. The harp (i. 143) is the Irish and not the Eastern, yet the latter has been
shown in i. 228; and the “Kánún” (ii. 77) is a reproduction from Lane’s Modern
Egyptians. The various Jinnis are fanciful, not traditional, as they should be (see <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">inter
alia</span></i> Doughty’s Arabia Deserta, ii. 3, etc). In i. 81 and ii. 622 appears a specimen bogie
with shaven chin and “droopers” by way of beard and mustachios: mostly they have
bestial or simiad countenances with rabbits’ ears, goats’ horns and so forth (i. 166, 169;
ii. 97, 100), instead of faces more or less human and eyes disposed perpendicularly. The
spreading yew-tree (i. 209) is utterly misplaced. In many the action is excessive, after
the fashion of the Illustrateds (i. 281; 356; 410 and 565; ii. 366, 374). The scymitar
and the knife, held in the left hand or slung by the left flank, are wholly out of order
(i. 407; ii. 281, 374: iii. 460) and in iii. 355, the blade is wider than the wielder’s
waist. In i. 374 the astrolabe is also held in the left hand. The features are classical as
those of Arsinoë, certainly not Egyptian, in i. 15; i. 479 and passim. The beggar-women
must not wander with faces bare and lacking “nose-bags” as in i. 512. The Shah
(i. 523) wears modern overalls strapped down over dress-<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bottines</span></i>: Moreover he holds a
straight-bladed European court-sword, which is correct in i. 527. The spears (i. 531)
are European not Asiatic, much less Arabian, whose beams are often 12–15 feet long.
Aziz (i. 537) has no right to tricot drawers and shoes tightened over the instep like the
chaussure of European <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moutards</span></i>: his foot (i. 540) is wholly out of drawing like his
hand and the toes are European distortions. The lady writing (i. 581) lacks all local
colour; she should sit at squat, support the paper in the hollow of her left instead of
using a portfolio, and with her right ply the reed or “pen of brass.” In vol ii. 57 the
lion is an absurdum, big as a cow or a camel and the same caricature of the King of Beasts
occurs elsewhere (i. 531; ii. 557 and iii. 250). The Wazir (ii. 105) wears the striped
caftan of a Cairene scribe or shopkeeper. The two birds (ii. 140) which are intended
for hawks (see ii. 130) have the compact tails and the rounded-off wings of pigeons. I
should pity Amjad and As’ad if packed into a “bullock trunk” like that borne by the
mule in ii. 156. The Jew’s daughter (ii. 185) and the Wali of Bulak (ii. 504) carry
European candlesticks much improved in ii. 624. The Persian leach (ii. 195) is habited
most unlike an ’Ajami, while the costume is correct in ii. 275. The Badawi mounts
(ii. 263) an impossible Arab with mane and tail like the barb’s in pictures. The streetdogs
(ii. 265), a notable race, become European curs of low degree. The mastage of
the galleys (ii. 305) would suit a modern racing-yacht. Utterly out of place are the
women’s costumes such as the Badawi maidens (ii. 335), Rose-in Hood (ii. 565), and
the girl of the Banú Odhrah (iii. 250), while the Lady Zubaydah (ii. 369) is coiffée with a
European coronet. The sea-going ship (ii. 615) is a Dahabiyah fit only for the Nile.
The banana-trees (ii. 621) tower at least 80 feet tall and the palms and cocoa-nut trees
(ii. 334; iii. 60) are indicated only by their foliage, not by their characteristic boles.
The box (ii. 624) is European and modern: in the Eastern “Sakhkhárah” the lid fits
into the top, thus saving it from the “baggage-smasher.” In iii. 76, the elephant, single-handed,
uproots a tree rivalling a century-old English oak. The camel-saddle (iii. 247)
is neither Eastern nor possible for the rider, but it presently improves (iii. 424 and elsewhere).
The emerging of the Merfolk (iii. 262) is a “tableau,” a transformation-scene
of the transpontine pantomime, and equally theatrical is the attitude of wicked Queen
Láb (iii. 298), while the Jinni, snatching away Daulat Khatun (iii. 341) seems to be
waltzing with her in horizontal position. A sun-parasol, not a huge Oriental umbrella,
is held over the King’s head (iii. 377). The tail-piece, the characteristic Sphinx (iii. 383)
is as badly drawn as it well can be, a vile caricature. Khalífah the Fisherman wears an
English night-gown (iii. 558) with the side-locks of a Polish Jew (iii. 564). The dancing-girl
(iii. 660) is equally reprehensible in form, costume and attitude, and lastly, the Fellah
ploughing (iii. 700) should wear a felt skull-cap in lieu of a turband, be stripped to the
waist and retain nothing but a rag around the middle.</p>

<p class="c000">I have carefully noted these lapses and incongruities: not the less, however, I
thoroughly appreciate the general excellence of the workmanship, and especially the
imaginative scenery and the architectural designs of Mr. W. Harvey. He has shown
the world how a work of the kind should be illustrated, and those who would surpass

<p class="c012">In the notice of Sir R. Burton’s “Life” in to-day’s <cite>Athenæum</cite> it is mentioned that
his biographer says that Capt. Burton proposed to march with his Bashi-bazuks to the
relief of Kars, but was frustrated by Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, who, according to Sir
Richard, “gained a prodigious reputation in Europe, chiefly by living out of it.”</p>

<p class="c012">This is a strange inversion of facts. The proposal to relieve Kars by way of
Redout-kalé and Kutais originated, not with Capt. Burton, but with the Turkish Seraskier,
who recommended for this purpose the employment of Vivian’s Turkish Contingent and
part of Beatson’s Horse (“his Bashi-bazuks,”) in which Capt. Burton held a staff
appointment. In the last days of June, 1855, General Mansfield, Lord Stratford’s
military adviser, was in constant communication on this subject with the Turkish Ministers,
and the details of the expedition were completely arranged to the satisfaction of military
opinion, both British and Turkish, at Constantinople. Lord Stratford officially
recommended the plan to his Government, and in his private letters to the Foreign
Secretary strongly urged it upon him, and expressed a sanguine hope of its success. But
on July 14th, Lord Clarendon telegraphed: “The plan for reinforcing the army at Kars
contained in your despatches of 30th June and 1st inst. is disapproved.” Lord Panmure
really “frustrated” the Turkish plan; Lord Stratford never “frustrated” any attempt
to succour the Army of Asia, but, contrariwise, did all in his power to forward the
object.</p>

<p class="c012">As to the amiable reference to the Great Elchi’s reputation, no one knows better
than Sir R. Burton by what queer methods reputations may be annexed; but it is strange
that anyone with the reputation of a traveller should consider Constantinople to be “out
of Europe.”</p>

<p class="c012">I am again the victim (<cite>Athenæum</cite>, August 25) of that everlasting <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">réclame</span></i>. Mr. S.
Lane-Poole has contracted to “do” a life of Lord Stratford, and, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</span></i>, he condemns me,
in magistral tone and a style of uncalled-for impertinence, to act as his “advt.” In
relating how, by order of the late General Beatson, then commanding Bash-buzuk
(<em>Bashi-bazuk</em> is the advertiser’s own property), I volunteered to relieve Kars, how I laid
the project before the “Great Eltchee,” how it was received with the roughest language
and how my first plan was thoroughly “frustrated.” I have told a true tale, and no
more. “A strange perversion of facts,” cries the sapient criticaster, with that normal
amenity which has won for him such honour and troops of unfriends: when his name was
proposed as secretary to the R.A.S., all prophesied the speediest dissolution of that infirm
body.</p>

<p class="c012">I am aware that Constantinople is <em>not</em> geographically “out of Europe.” But when
Mr. S. Lane-Poole shall have travelled a trifle more he may learn that ethnologically it is.
In fact, most of South-Eastern Europe holds itself more or less non-European; and when
a Montenegrin marries a Frenchwoman or a German, his family will tell you that he has
wedded a “European.”</p>

<p class="c012">“No one knows better than Sir R. Burton by what queer methods reputation may be
annexed.” Heavens, what English! And what may the man mean? But perhaps he
alludes in his own silly, saltless, sneering way to my <em>Thousand Nights and a Night</em>,
which has shown what the “Uncle and Master’s” work should have been. Some two
generations of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">poules mouillées</span></i> have reprinted and republished Lane’s “Arabian Notes”
without having the simple honesty to correct a single <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bévue</span></i>, or to abate one blunder;
while they looked upon the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite> as their own especial rotten borough. But

himself. Disregarding personalities, I observe that he advances no single fact in support

address, stamps upon the cover <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Avis aux Libraires</span></i> under <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Edition privée</span></i> and adds <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce volume
ne doit pas être mis en vente ou exposé dans les lieux publics</span></i> (<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Loi du 29 Juillet, 1881</span></i>).
He also prints upon the back the number of copies for sale. We treat “pornology”
as we handle prostitution, unwisely ignore it, well knowing the while that it is a natural
and universal demand of civilised humanity; and whereas continental peoples regulate
it and limit its abuses we pass it by, Pharisee-like with <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nez en-l’air</span></i>. Our laws upon the
subject are made only to be broken and the authorities are unwilling to persecute, because
by so doing they advertise what they condemn. Thus they offer a premium to the greedy
and unscrupulous publisher and immensely enhance the value of productions (“Fanny
Hill” by Richard Cleland for instance) which, if allowed free publication would fetch
pence instead of pounds. With due diffidence, I suggest that the police be directed to
remove from booksellers’ windows and to confiscate all indecent pictures, prints and
photographs; I would forbid them under penalty of heavy fines to expose immoral
books for sale, and I would leave “cheap and nasty” literature to the good taste of the
publisher and the public. Thus we should also abate the scandal of providing the
secretaries and officers of the various anti-vice societies with libraries of pornological
works which, supposed to be escheated or burned, find their way into the virtuous hands
of those who are supposed to destroy them.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r454">454</a>.  </span>Here I would by no means assert that the subject matter of The Nights is
exhausted; much has been left for future labourers. It would be easy indeed to add
another five volumes to my sixteen, as every complete manuscript contains more or less
of novelty. Dr. Pertsch, the learned librarian of Saxe-Gotha, informs me that no less
than two volumes are taken up by a variant of Judar the Egyptian (in my vol. vi. 213)
and by the History of Zahir and Ali. For the Turkish version in the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèquè
Nationale</span></i> see M. Zotenberg (pp. 21–23). The Rich MS. in the British Museum
abounds in novelties, of which a specimen was given in my Prospectus to the Supplemental
Volumes.</p>

<p class="c000">In the French Scholar’s “Alâ al-Dîn” (p. 45) we find the MSS. of The Nights
divided into three groups. No. i. or the Asian (a total of ten specified) are mostly
incomplete and usually end before the half of the text. The second is the Egyptian of
modern date, characterised by an especial style and condensed narration and by the
nature and ordinance of the tales; by the number of fables and historiettes, and
generally by the long chivalrous Romance of Omar bin al-Nu’umán. The third group,
also Egyptian, differs only in the distribution of the stories.</p>
