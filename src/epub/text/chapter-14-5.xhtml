<p>It is recounted that in Mosul was a King and he was Lord of
moneys and means and troops and guards. Now in the beginning
of his career his adventures were strange for that he was not of
royal rank or race, nor was he of the sons of Kings but prosperity
met him because of the honesty of his manners and morals. His
name was Abu Niyyah, the single-minded—and he was so poor that
he had naught of worldly weal, so quoth he to himself, “Remove
thee from this town and haply Allah will widen thy means of
livelihood inasmuch as the byword saith:—Travel, for indeed
much of the joys of life are in travelling.” So he fixed his mind
upon removal from the town; and, having very few articles of his
own, he sold them for a single dinar which he took and fared forth
from his place of birth seeking another stead. Now when journeying
he sighted following him a man who was also on the move
and he made acquaintance with him and the two fell to communing
together upon the road. Each of the twain wished to know the
name of his comrade and Abu Niyyah asked his fellow, saying,
“O my brother, what may be thy name?” whereto the other
answered, “I am called Abu Niyyatayn—the two-minded.” “And
I am Abu Niyyah!” cried the other, and his fellow traveller
questioned him saying, “Hast thou with thee aught of money?”,
Whereto he replied, “I have with me a single Ashrafi and no
more.” Quoth the other, “But I have ten gold pieces, so do thou
have a care of them and the same will be eleven.” Abu Niyyah
accepted the charge and they went upon the road together and as
often as they entered a town they nighted therein for a single
night or two and in the morning they departed therefrom. This
continued for a while of time until they made a city which had
two gates and Abu Niyyah forewent his fellow through one of
the entrances and suddenly heard an asker which was a slave begging
and saying, “O ye beneficent, O doers of good deeds, an
alms shall bring ten-fold.” And as the chattel drew near<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7069" id="noteref-7069" epub:type="noteref">7069</a> and
Abu Niyyah noted his words, his heart was softened and he gave
him his single Ashrafi; whereupon his comrade looked upon him
and asked “What hast thou doled to him?” Answered he, “An
Ashrafi;” and quoth the other, “Thou hast but a single gold piece
whilst I have ten”; so he took the joint stock from him and left
him and went his way.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I should relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Seventy-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an
thou be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that
the man Abu Niyyatayn took from Abu Niyyah the ten Ashrafis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7070" id="noteref-7070" epub:type="noteref">7070</a>
and said to him, “The gold piece belonging to thee thou hast
given to the asker;” then, carrying away the other ten he left
him and went about his business. Now Abu Niyyah had with him
not a single copper neither aught of provaunt so he wandered
about the town to find a Cathedral-mosque and seeing one he went
into it and made the Wuzu ablution and prayed that which was
incumbent on him of obligatory prayers. Then he seated himself
to rest until the hour of the sunset devotions and he said to himself
“Ho, Such-an-one! this be a time when no one knoweth thee; so
go forth and fare round about the doors and have a heed, haply
Allah Almighty our Lord shall give thee somewhat of daily bread
thou shalt eat blessing the Creator.” Hereupon he went forth the
Mosque and wandered through the nearest quarter, when behold,
he came upon a lofty gate and a well adorned; so he stood before
it and saw a slave lad coming out therefrom and bearing on his
head a platter wherein was a pile of broken bread and some bones,
and the boy stood there and shook the contents of the platter upon
the ground. Abu Niyyah seeing this came forward and fell to
picking up the orts of bread and ate them and gnawed the flesh
from sundry of the bones till he was satisfied and the slave diverted
himself by looking on. After that he cried, “Alhamdolillah—Glory
be to God!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7071" id="noteref-7071" epub:type="noteref">7071</a> and the chattel went upstairs to his master and
said, “O my lord, I have seen a marvel!” Quoth the other, “And
what may that be?” and quoth the servile, “I found a man
standing at our door and he was silent and spoke not a word; but
when he saw me throwing away the remnants<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7072" id="noteref-7072" epub:type="noteref">7072</a> of our eating-cloth he
came up to them and fell to devouring bittocks of the bread and to
breaking the bones and sucking them, after which he cried, “Alhamdolillah.””
Said the master, “O my good slave, do thou take
these ten Ashrafis and give them to the man;” so the lad went
down the stair and was half-way when he filched one of the gold
pieces and then having descended he gave the nine. Hereupon
Abu Niyyah counted them and finding only nine, said, “There
wanteth one Ashrafi, for the asker declared, An almsdeed bringeth
ten-fold, and I gave him a single gold piece.” The house master
heard him saying, “There wanteth an Ashrafi,” and he bade the
slave call aloud to him and Abu Niyyah went upstairs to the
sitting room, where he found the owner, a merchant of repute, and
salam’d to him. The other returned his greeting and said, “Ho
fellow!” and the other said “Yes,” when the first resumed, “The
slave, what did he give thee?” “He gave me,” said Abu Niyyah,
“nine Ashrafis;” and the house-master rejoined, “Wherefore
didst thou declare, There faileth me one gold piece? Hast thou
a legal claim of debt upon us for an Ashrafi, O thou scanty of
shame?” He answered, “No, by Allah, O my lord; my intent
was not that but there befel me with a man which was a beggar
such-and-such matter.” Hereupon the merchant understood his
meaning and said to him, “Do thou sit thee down here and pass
the night with us.” So Abu Niyyah seated himself by his side
and nighted with the merchant until the morning. Now this was
the season for the payment of the poor-rates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7073" id="noteref-7073" epub:type="noteref">7073</a> and that merchant
was wont to take the sum from his property by weight of scales,
so he summoned the official weigher who by means of his balance
computed the account and took out the poor-rate and gave the
whole proceeds to Abu Niyyah. Quoth he, “O my lord, what
shall I do with all this good, especially as thou hast favoured me
with thy regard?” “No matter for that,” quoth the other; so
Abu Niyyah went forth from the presence of his patron and hiring
himself a shop fell to buying what suited him of all kinds of merchandise
such as a portion of coffee-beans and of pepper and of
tin;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7074" id="noteref-7074" epub:type="noteref">7074</a> and stuffs of Al-Hind, together with other matters, saying
to himself, “Verily this shop is the property of thy hand.” So
he sat there selling and buying and he was in the easiest of life
and in all comfort rife for a while of time when behold, his quondam
companion, Abu Niyyatayn was seen passing along the market-street.
His eyes were deep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7075" id="noteref-7075" epub:type="noteref">7075</a> sunken and he was propped upon a staff
as he begged and cried, “O good folk, O ye beneficent, give me an
alms for the love of Allah!” But when his sometime associate,
Abu Niyyah looked upon him, he knew him and said to the slave
whom he had bought for his service, “Go thou and bring me
yonder man.” Hereat the chattel went and brought him and Abu
Niyyah seated him upon the shopboard and sent his servile to buy
somewhat of food and he set it before Abu Niyyatayn who ate till
he was filled. After this the wanderer asked leave to depart but
the other said to him, “Sit thou here, O Shaykh; for thou art my
guest during the coming night.” Accordingly he seated himself
in the shop till the hour of sundown, when Abu Niyyah took him
and led him to his lodging where the slave served up the supper-tray
and they ate till they had eaten their sufficiency. Then they washed
their hands and abode talking together till at last quoth Abu
Niyyah, “O my brother, hast thou not recognised me?” to which
the other responded, “No, by Allah, O my brother.” Hereupon said
the house-master, “I am thy whilome comrade Abu Niyyah, and
we came together, I and thou, from such-and-such a place to this
city. But I, O my brother, have never changed mine intent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7076" id="noteref-7076" epub:type="noteref">7076</a> and
all thou seest with me of good, the half thereof belongeth to thee.”
When it was morning tide he presented him with the moiety of
all he possessed of money and means and opened for him a shop
in the Bazar by the side of his own and Abu Niyyatayn fell to
selling and buying, and he and his friend Abu Niyyah led the most
joyous of lives. This endured for a while of time until one day of
the days when quoth Abu Niyyatayn to Abu Niyyah, “O my
brother, we have exhausted our sitting in this city, so do thou
travel with us unto another.” Quoth Abu Niyyah, “Why, O my
brother, should we cease abiding here in comfort when we have
gained abundance of wealth and moveables and valuables and we
seek naught save a restful life?” However Abu Niyyatayn ceased
not to repeat his words to him and persist in his purpose and
reiterate his demand, till Abu Niyyah was pleased with the idea
of travelling——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I should relate to
you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Abu Niyyah
was pleased with the idea of travelling companied by Abu
Niyyatayn: so they got themselves ready and loaded a caravan of
camels and mules and went off from that city and travelled for a
space of twenty days. At last they came to a camping-ground
about sunset-hour and they alighted therein seeking rest and a
nighting stead, and next morning when they arose they sought
where they could fodder and water their cattle. Now the only
place they found was a well and one said to other, “Who will
descend therein and draw for us drink?” Cried Abu Niyyah, “I
will go down” (but he knew not what was fated to him in the
Eternal Purpose), and so saying he let himself down by the rope
into the well and filled for them the water-buckets till the caravan
had its sufficiency. Now Abu Niyyatayn for the excess of his
envy and hatred was scheming in his heart and his secret soul to
slay Abu Niyyah, and when all had drunk he cut the cord and
loaded his beasts and fared away leaving his companion in the
well, for the first day and the second until the coming of night.
Suddenly two ’Ifrits forgathered in that well and sat down to
converse each with other, when quoth the first, “What is to do
with thee and how is thy case and what mayest thou be?” Quoth
his fellow, “By Allah, O my brother, I am satisfied with extreme
satisfaction and I never leave the Sultan’s daughter at all at all.”
The second Ifrit asked, “And what would forbid thee from her?”
and he answered, “I should be driven away by somewhat of
wormwood-powder scattered beneath the soles of her feet during
the congregational prayers of Friday.” Then quoth the other,
“I also, by Allah, am joyful and exulting in the possession of a
Hoard of jewels buried without the town near the Azure Column
which serveth as bench-mark.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7077" id="noteref-7077" epub:type="noteref">7077</a> “And what,” asked the other to
his friend, “would expel thee therefrom and expose the jewels to
the gaze of man?” whereto he answered, “A white cock in his
tenth month<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7078" id="noteref-7078" epub:type="noteref">7078</a> slaughtered upon the Azure Column would drive me
away from the Hoard and would break the Talisman when the
gems would be visible to all.” Now as soon as Abu Niyyah had
heard the words of the two Ifrits, they arose and departed from the
well; and it was the morning hour when, behold, a caravan was
passing by that place, so the travellers halted seeking a drink of
water. Presently they let down a bucket which was seized by
Abu Niyyah and as he was being drawn up they cried out and
asked, “What art thou, of Jinn-kind or of mankind?” and he
answered, “I am of the Sons of Adam.” Hereupon they drew him up
from the pit and questioned him of his case and he said, “I have
fallen into it and I am sore anhungered.” Accordingly they gave
him somewhat to eat and he ate and travelled with them till they
entered a certain city and it was on First day.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7079" id="noteref-7079" epub:type="noteref">7079</a> So they passed
through the market streets which were crowded and found the
people in turmoil and trouble;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7080" id="noteref-7080" epub:type="noteref">7080</a> and as one enquired the cause
thereof he was answered, “Verily the Sultan hath a beautiful
daughter who is possessed and overridden by an ’Ifrit, and whoso
of the physicians would lay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7081" id="noteref-7081" epub:type="noteref">7081</a> the Spirit and is unable or ignorant
so to do, the King taketh him and cutteth off his head and
hangeth it up before his palace. Indeed of late days a student
came hither, a youth who knew nothing of expelling the Evil One,
and he accepted the task and the Sultan designeth to smite his neck
at this very hour; so the people are flocking with design to divert
themselves at the decapitation.” Now when Abu Niyyah heard
these words he rose without stay or delay and walked in haste till
he came into the presence of the Sultan whom he found seated
upon his throne and the Linkman standing with his scymitar
brandished over the head of the young student and expecting only
the royal order to strike his neck. So Abu Niyyah salam’d to
him and said, “O King of the Age, release yonder youth from
under the sword and send him to thy prison, for if I avail to laying
the Spirit and driving him from thy daughter thou shalt have
mercy upon yonder wight, and if I fail thou wilt shorten by the
head me as well as him.” Hereupon the King let unbind the
youth and sent him to jail; then he said to Abu Niyyah, “Wouldst
thou go at once to my daughter and unspell her from the Jinni?”
But the other replied, “No, O King, not until Meeting-day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7082" id="noteref-7082" epub:type="noteref">7082</a> at
what time the folk are engaged in congregational prayers.” Now
when Abu Niyyah had appointed the Friday, the King set apart for
his guest an apartment and rationed him with liberal rations.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I should relate to you on the coming night an the
King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Abu Niyyah
having appointed the Sultan for Meeting-day, when he would
unsorcel the Princess, waited till the morning dawned. Then he
went forth to the Bazar and brought him a somewhat of wormwood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7083" id="noteref-7083" epub:type="noteref">7083</a>
for a silvern Nusf and brought it back, and, as soon as the
time of congregational prayers came, the Sultan went forth to his
devotions and gave orders that Abu Niyyah be admitted to his
daughter whilst the folk were busy at their devotions. Abu
Niyyah repaired to his patient, and scattered the Absinthium
beneath the soles of her feet when, lo, and behold! she was
made whole, and she groaned and cried aloud, “Where am I?”
Hereat the mother rejoiced and whoso were in the Palace; and, as
the Sultan returned from the Mosque, he found his daughter sitting
sane and sound, after they had dressed her and perfumed her and
adorned her, and she met him with glee and gladness. So the
two embraced and their joy increased, and the father fell to giving
alms and scattering moneys amongst the Fakirs and the miserable
and the widows and orphans, in gratitude for his daughter’s
recovery. Moreover he also released the student youth and
largessed him, and bade him gang his gait. After this the King
summoned Abu Niyyah into the presence and said to him, “O
young man, ask a boon first of Allah and then of me and let it be
everything thou wishest and wantest.” Quoth the other, “I
require of thee to wife the damsel from whom I drove away the
Spirit,” and the King turning to his Minister said, “Counsel
me, O Wazir.” Quoth the other, “Put him off until the morrow;”
and quoth the Sultan, “O youth, come back to me hither on
the morning of the next day.” Hereupon Abu Niyyah was dismissed
the presence, and betimes on the day appointed he came
to the Sultan and found the Wazir beside him hending in
hand a gem whose like was not to be found amongst the Kings.
Then he set it before the Sultan and said to him, “Show it to the
Youth and say him, ‘The dowry of the Princess, my daughter, is a
jewel like unto this.’” But whilst Abu Niyyah was standing
between his hands the King showed him the gem and repeated to
him the words of the Wazir, thinking to himself that it was a pretext
for refusing the youth, and saying in his mind, “He will
never be able to produce aught like that which the Wazir hath
brought.” Hereupon Abu Niyyah asked, “An so be I bring thee
ten equal to this, wilt thou give me the damsel?” and the King
answered, “I will.” The youth went from him when this was
agreed upon and fared to the Market Street, where he bought him
a white cock in its tenth month, such as had been described by
the ’Ifrit, whose plume had not a trace of black or red feathers
but was of the purest white. Then he fared without the town
and in the direction of the setting sun until he came to the Azure
Column, which he found exactly as he had heard it from the
Jinni, and going to it, he cut the throat of the cock thereupon,
when all of a sudden the earth gaped and therein appeared a
chamber full of jewels sized as ostrich eggs. That being the
Hoard, he went forth and brought with him ten camels, each
bearing two large sacks, and returning to the treasure-room, he
filled all of these bags with gems and loaded them upon the beasts.
Presently he entered to the Sultan with his string of ten camels
and, causing them kneel in the courtyard of the Divan, cried to
him, “Come down, O King of the Age, and take the dowry of thy
daughter.” So the Sultan turned towards him and, looking at the
ten camels, exclaimed, “By Allah, this Youth is Jinn-mad; yet
will I go down to see him.” Accordingly he descended the staircase
to the place where the camels had been made kneel, and
when the sacks had been unloaded and as the King came amongst
them, the bags were opened and were found full of jewels greater
and more glorious than the one was with him. Hereupon the
Sultan was perplext and his wits were bewildered, and he cried
to the Wazir, “Walláhi! I think that all the Kings of the Earth in
its length and its breadth have not one single gem the like of
these: but say me how shall I act, O Wazir?” The Minister
replied, “Give him the girl.”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I should relate
to you on the coming night, an the King suffer me to survive?”

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Wazir said
to the King, “Give him the girl.” Hereupon the marriage-tie
was tied and the bridegroom was led in to the bride, and either
rejoiced mightily in his mate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7084" id="noteref-7084" epub:type="noteref">7084</a> and was increased their joy and
destroyed was all annoy. Now Abu Niyyah was a favourite of
Fortune, so the Sultan appointed to him the government during
three days of every week, and he continued ruling after that
fashion for a while of time. But one day of the days, as he was
sitting in his plesaunce, suddenly the man Abu Niyyatayn passed
before him leaning on a palm-stick, and crying, “O ye beneficent,
O ye folk of good!” When Abu Niyyah beheld him he said to his
Chamberlain, “Hither with yonder man;” and as soon as he was
brought he bade them lead him to the Hammam and dress him
in a new habit. They did his bidding and set the beggar before
his whilome comrade who said to him, “Dost thou know me?”
“No, O my lord,” said the other; and he, “I am thy companion
of old whom thou wouldst have left to die in the well; but I,
by Allah, never changed my intent, and all that I own in this
world I will give unto thee half thereof.” And they sat in
converse for a while of time, until at last quoth the Double-minded
one, “Whence camest thou by all this?” and quoth he,
“From the well wherein thou threwest me.” Hereupon from the
excess of his envy and malice Abu Niyyatayn said to Abu Niyyah,
“I also will go down that well and what to thee was given the
same shall be given to me.” Then he left him and went forth
from him, and he ceased not faring until he made the place.
Presently he descended, and having reached the bottom, there
sat until the hour of nightfall, when behold! the two ’Ifrits came
and, taking seat by the well-mouth, salam’d each to other. But
they had no force nor contrivance and both were as weaklings;
so said one of them, “What is thy case, O my brother, and how
is thy health?” and said the other, “Ah me, O my brother, since
the hour that I was with thee in this place on such a night, I
have been cast out of the Sultan’s daughter, and until this tide
I have been unable to approach her or indeed at any other time.”
Said his comrade, “I also am like thee, for the Hoard hath gone
forth from me, and I have waxed feeble.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7085" id="noteref-7085" epub:type="noteref">7085</a> Then cried the twain,
“By Allah, the origin of our losses is from this well, so let us
block it up with stones.” Hereupon the twain arose and brought
with them crumbling earth and pebbles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7086" id="noteref-7086" epub:type="noteref">7086</a> and threw it down the
well when it fell upon Abu Niyyatayn, and his bones were crushed
upon his flesh.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7087" id="noteref-7087" epub:type="noteref">7087</a> Now his comrade, Abu Niyyah sat expecting him
to return, but he came not, so he cried, “Walláhi! needs must I
go and look for him in yonder well and see what he is doing.”
So he took horse and fared thither and found the pit filled up;
so he knew and was certified that his comrade’s intent had been
evil, and had cast him into the hands of death.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to
say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
should relate to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Abu Niyyah
knew and was certified of his comrade Abu Niyyatayn being dead,
so he cried aloud, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah the Glorious, the Great. O Allah mine, do thou
deliver me from envy, for that it destroyeth the envier and haply
jealousy may lead to frowardness against the Lord (glorified be
His Glory!);” and so saying he returned to the seat of his
kingdom. Now the Sultan’s daughter his spouse had two
sisters, both married,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7088" id="noteref-7088" epub:type="noteref">7088</a> and she after the delay of a year or so
proved with child, but when her tale of days was told and her
delivery was nearhand her father fell sick and his malady grew
upon him. So he summoned the Lords of his court and his
kingdom one and all and he said, “In very deed this my son-in-law
shall after my decease become my successor;” and he
wrote a writ to that purport and devised to him the realm and
the reign before his demise; nor was there long delay ere the
old King departed to the ruth of Allah and they buried him.
Hereupon trouble arose between his two other sons-in-law who
had married the Princesses and said they, “We were connected
with him ere this man was and we are before him in our claim
to the kingdom.” Thereupon said the Wazir, “This rede is
other than right, for that the old King before his decease devised
his country to this one and also wrote it in his will and
testament: here therefore ye are opposing him, and the result will
be trouble and repentance.” And when the Minister spoke on
such wise they kept to their houses. Presently the wife of Abu
Niyyah bare him a babe, her two sisters being present at her
accouchement; and they gave to the midwife an hundred gold
pieces and agreed upon what was to be done. So when the babe
was born they put in his place a pup and taking the infant away
sent it by a slave-girl who exposed it at the gateway of the royal
garden. Then they said and spread abroad, “Verily the Sultan’s
wife hath been delivered of a doglet,” and when the tidings came
to Abu Niyyah’s ears he exclaimed, “Verily this also is a creation
of Allah Almighty’s:” so they clothed the pup and tended it
with all care. Anon the wife became pregnant a second time
and when her days were fulfilled she bare a second babe which
was the fairest of its time and the sisters did with it as they had
done with the first and taking the infant they exposed him at the
door of the garden. Then they brought to the mother another
dog-pup in lieu of her babe, saying, “Verily the Queen hath been
delivered a second time of a doglet.” Now on this wise it fared
with them: but as regards the two infants which were cast away
at the garden gate the first was taken up by the Gardener whose
wife, by the decree of the Decreer, had become a mother on that
very same night; so the man carried away the infant he found
exposed and brought the foundling home and the woman fell to
suckling it. After the third year the Gardener went forth one
day of the days and happening upon the second infant in similar
case he bore it also back to his wife who began to suckle it and
wash it and tend it and nurse it, till the twain grew up and entered
into their third and fourth years. The Sultan had in the meantime
been keeping the two pups which he deemed to have been
brought forth by his wife until the Queen became in the family-way
for the third time. Hereupon the Sultan said, “By Allah,
’tis not possible but that I be present at and witness her accouchement;”
and the while she was bringing forth he sat beside her.
So she was delivered of a girl-child, in whom the father rejoiced
with great joy and bade bring for her wet-nurses who suckled her
for two years until the milk time was past.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7089" id="noteref-7089" epub:type="noteref">7089</a> This girl grew up
till she reached the age of four years and she could distinguish
between her mother and her father who, whenever he went to the
royal garden would take her with him. But when she beheld the
Gardener’s two boys she became familiar with them and would
play with them; and, as each day ended, her father would carry
her away from the children and lead her home, and this parting
was grievous to her and she wept right sore. Hereat the Sultan
would take also the boys with her until sleep prevailed over her,
after which he would send the twain back to their sire the
Gardener. But Abu Niyyah the Sultan would ever wonder at the
boys and would exclaim, “Praise be to Allah, how beautiful are
these dark-skinned children!” This endured until one day of
the days when the King entered the garden and there found that
the two beautiful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7090" id="noteref-7090" epub:type="noteref">7090</a> boys had taken some clay and were working it
into the figures of horses and saddles and weapons of war and
were opening the ground and making a water-leat;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7091" id="noteref-7091" epub:type="noteref">7091</a> so the Sultan
wondered thereat time after time for that he ever found them in
similar case. And he marvelled the more because whenever he
looked upon them his heart was opened to both and he yearned
to the twain and he would give them some gold pieces although
he knew not the cause of his affection. Now one day he entered
the garden, as was his wont, and he came upon the two boys of
whom one was saying, “I am the Sultan!” and the other
declaring, “I am the Wazir!” He wondered at their words and
forthwith summoned the Gardener and asked him concerning the
lads, and lastly quoth he to him, “Say me sooth and fear naught
from me.” Quoth the other, “By Allah, O King of the Age, albe
falsehood be saving, yet is soothfastness more saving and most
saving; and indeed as regards these children the elder was found
by me exposed at the gateway of the royal garden on such a night
of such a year, and I came upon the second in the very same
place; so I carried them to my wife who suckled them and
tended them and they say to her, ‘O mother,’ and they say
to me, ‘O father.’” Hereupon Abu Niyyah the King returned
home and summoning the midwife asked her, saying, “By the
virtue of my predecessors in this kingdom, do thou tell me the
truth concerning my spouse, whether or no she was delivered
of two dog-pups,” and she answered, “No, by Allah, O King
of the Age, verily the Queen bare thee two babes like full moons,
and the cause of their exposure before the garden gate was thy
wife’s two sisters who envied her and did with her these deeds
whereof she was not aware.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7092" id="noteref-7092" epub:type="noteref">7092</a> Hereupon cried Abu Niyyah,
“Alhamdolillah—Glory be to God who hath brought about
this good to me and hath united me with my children, and soothfast
is the say:—Whoso doeth an action shall be requited of his
Lord and the envious wight hath no delight and of his envy he
shall win naught save despight.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7093" id="noteref-7093" epub:type="noteref">7093</a> Then the King of Mosul, being,
a man of good intent, did not put to death his wife’s sisters and
their husbands, but banished them his realm, and he lived happily
with his Queen and children until such time as the Destroyer of
delights and the Severer of societies came to him and he deceased
to the mercy of Almighty Allah.</p>
