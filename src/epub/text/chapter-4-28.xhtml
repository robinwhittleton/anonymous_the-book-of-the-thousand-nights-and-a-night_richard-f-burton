<p>A certain Shroff, bearing a bag of gold pieces, once passed by a
company of thieves, and one of these sharpers said to the others,
“I, and I only, have the power to steal yonder purse.” So they
asked, “How wilt thou do it?”; and he answered, “Lookye all!”;
and followed the money-changer, till he entered his house, when he
threw the bag on a shelf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2039" id="noteref-2039" epub:type="noteref">2039</a> and, being affected with diabetes, went
into the chapel of ease to do his want, calling to the slave-girl,
“Bring me an ewer of water.” She took the ewer and followed him
to the privy, leaving the door open, whereupon the thief entered
and, seizing the money-bag, made off with it to his companions, to
whom he told what had passed.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the thief
took the money-bag and made off with it to his companions to
whom he told what had passed. Said they, “By Allah, thou hast
played a clever trick! ‘tis not every one could do it; but, presently
the money-changer will come out of the privy; and, missing
the bag of money, he will beat the slave-girl and torture her with
grievous torture. ‘Tis as though thou hast at present done nothing
worthy of praise; so, if thou be indeed a sharper, return and save
the girl from being beaten and questioned.” Quoth he, “Inshallah!
I will save both girl and purse.” Then the prig went back to the
Shroff’s house and found him punishing the girl because of the
purse; so he knocked at the door and the man said, “Who is
there?” Cried the thief, “I am the servant of thy neighbour in
the Exchange;” whereupon he came out to him and said, “What
is thy business?” The thief replied, “My master saluteth thee
and saith to thee:—Surely thou art deranged and thoroughly so,
to cast the like of this bag of money down at the door of thy shop
and go away and leave it. Had a stranger hit upon it he had
made off with it and, except my master had seen it and taken care
of it, it had assuredly been lost to thee.” So saying, he pulled out
the purse and showed it to the Shroff who on seeing it said, “That
is my very purse,” and put out his hand to take it; but the thief
said, “By Allah, I will not give thee this same, till thou write me a
receipt declaring that thou hast received it! for indeed I fear my
master will not believe that thou hast recovered the purse, unless I
bring him thy writing to that effect, and sealed with thy signet-seal.”
The money-changer went in to write the paper required;
and in the meantime the thief made off with the bag of money and
thus was the slave-girl saved her beating. And men also tell a
