			<h2 epub:type="title">The Story of the Kazi Who Bare a Babe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6878" id="noteref-6878" epub:type="noteref">6878</a></h2>

<p>It hath been related that in Tarábulus-town<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6879" id="noteref-6879" epub:type="noteref">6879</a> of Syria was a Kází
appointed under orders of the Caliph Hárún al-Rashíd to adjudge
law-suits and dissolve contracts and cross-examine witnesses; and
after taking seat in his Mahkamah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6880" id="noteref-6880" epub:type="noteref">6880</a> his rigour and severity became
well known to all men. Now this judge kept a black handmaiden
likest unto a buffalo-bull and she cohabited with him for a
lengthened while; for his nature was ever niggardly nor could anyone
wrest from him half a Faddah or any alms-gift or aught else;
and his diet was of biscuit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6881" id="noteref-6881" epub:type="noteref">6881</a> and onions. Moreover, he was ostentatious
as he was miserly: he had an eating-cloth bordered with a
fine bell-fringe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6882" id="noteref-6882" epub:type="noteref">6882</a> and when any person entered about dinner-time
or supper-tide he would cry out, “O handmaid, fetch the fringed
table-cloth;” and all who heard his words would say to themselves,
“By Allah, this must needs be a costly thing.” Presently
one day of the days his assessors and officers said to him, “O our
lord the Kazi, take to thyself a wife, for yon negress becometh
not a dignitary of thy degree.” Said he, “An this need be, let
any who hath a daughter give her to me in wedlock and I will
espouse her.” Herewith quoth one present, “I have a fair daughter
and a marriageable,” whereto quoth the Kazi, “An thou wouldst
do me a favour this is the time.” So the bride was fitted out and
the espousals took place forthright and that same night the Kazi’s
father-in-law came to him and led him in to his bride saying in
his heart, “I am now connected with the Kazi.” And he took
pleasure in the thought for he knew naught of the judge’s
stinginess and he could not suppose but that his daughter would
be comfortable with her mate and well-to-do in the matter of diet
and dress and furniture. Such were the fancies which occurred to
him; but as for the Kazi, he lay with the maid and abated her
maidenhead; and she in the morning awaited somewhat wherewith
to break her fast and waited in vain. Presently the Kazi left her
and repaired to his court-house whither the city-folk came and
gave him joy of his marriage and wished him good morning,
saying in themselves, “Needs must he make a mighty fine bride-feast.”
But they sat there to no purpose until past noon when
each went his own way privily damning the judge’s penuriousness.
As soon as they were gone he returned to his Harem and cried
out to his black wench, “O handmaiden, fetch the fringed table-cloth;”
and his bride hearing this rejoiced, saying to herself, “By
Allah, his calling for this cloth requireth a banquet which befitteth
it, food suitable for the Kings.” The negress arose and faring
forth for a short time returned with the cloth richly fringed and
set upon it a Kursi-stool,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6883" id="noteref-6883" epub:type="noteref">6883</a> and a tray of brass whereon were served
three biscuits and three onions. When the bride saw this, she
prayed in her heart saying, “Now may my Lord wreak my revenge
upon my father!” but her husband cried to her, “Come hither, my
girl,” and the three sat down to the tray wherefrom each took a
biscuit and an onion. The Kazi and the negress ate all their
portions, but the bride could not swallow even a third of the hard
bread apportioned to her; so she rose up, heartily cursing her
father’s ambition in her heart. At supper-tide it was the same
till the state of things became longsome to her and this endured
continuously for three days, when she was ready to sink with
hunger. So she sent for her sire and cried aloud in his face. The
Kazi hearing the outcries of his bride asked, “What is to do?”
whereupon they informed him that the young woman was not in
love with this style of living.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the bride
was not in love with the Kazi’s mode of living; so he took her and
cut off her nose and divorced her, falsely declaring that she had
behaved frowardly. On the next day he proposed for another wife
and married her and entreated her in like fashion as the first;
and when she demanded a divorce, he shredded off her nostrils
and put her away; and whatever woman he espoused he starved
by his stinginess and tortured with hunger, and when any demanded
a divorce he would chop off her nose on false pretences and put
her away without paying aught either of her marriage settlement
or of the contingent dowry. At last the report of that Kazi’s
avarice came to the ears of a damsel of Mosul-city, a model of
beauty and loveliness who had insight into things hidden and just
judgment and skilful contrivance. Thereupon, resolved to avenge
her sex, she left her native place and journeyed till she made
Tarábulus; and by the decree of the Decreer at that very time the
judge, after a day spent in his garden, purposed to return home so
he mounted his mule and met her half-way between the pleasance
and the town. He chanced to glance at her and saw that she was
wondrous beautiful and lovely, symmetrical and graceful and the
spittle ran from his mouth wetting his mustachios; and he advanced
and accosting her said, “O thou noble one, whence comest thou
hither?” “From behind me!” “<em>Connu.</em> I knew that; but from
what city?” “From Mosul.” “Art thou single and secluded or
femme couverte with a husband alive.” “Single I am still!” “Can
it be that thou wilt take me and thou become to me mate and I
become to thee man?” “If such be our fate ’twill take place and
I will give thee an answer to-morrow;” and so saying the damsel
went on to Tarábulus. Now the Kazi after hearing her speech felt
his love for her increase; so next morning he sent to ask after her,
and when they told him that she had alighted at a Khan, he
despatched to her the negress his concubine with a party of friends
to ask her in marriage, notifying that he was Kazi of the city.
Thereupon she demanded a dower of fifty dinars and naming
a deputy caused the knot be knotted and she came to him about
evening time and he went in to her. But when it was the supperhour
he called as was his wont to his black handmaiden saying
“Fetch the fringed table-cloth,” and she fared forth and fetched it
bringing also three biscuits and three onions, and as soon as the
meal was served up all three sat down to it, the Kazi, the slave-girl,
and the new bride. Each took a biscuit and an onion and ate
them up and the bride exclaimed “Allah requite thee with wealth.
By Allah, this be a wholesome supper.” When the judge heard
this he was delighted with her and cried out, “Extolled be the
Almighty for that at last He hath vouchsafed to me a wife who
thanketh the Lord for muchel or for little!” But he knew not
what the Almighty had decreed to him through the wile and guile,
the malice and mischief of women. Next morning the Kazi
repaired to the Mahkamah and the bride arose and solaced herself
with looking at the apartments, of which some lay open whilst
others were closed. Presently she came to one which was made
fast by a door with a wooden bolt and a padlock of iron: she
considered it and found it strong but at the threshold was a fissure
about the breadth of a finger; so she peeped through and espied
gold and silver coins heaped up in trays of brass which stood upon
Kursi-stools and the nearest about ten cubits from the door. She
then arose and fetched a long wand, the mid-rib of a date-palm,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6884" id="noteref-6884" epub:type="noteref">6884</a>
and arming the end with a lump of leaven she pushed it through
the chink under the door and turned it round and round upon
the money-trays as if sewing or writing. At last two dinars stuck
to the dough and she drew them through the fissure and returned
to her own chamber; then, calling the negress, she gave her the
ducats saying, “Go thou to the Bazar and buy us some mutton
and rice and clarified butter; and do thou also bring us some fresh
bread and spices and return with them without delay.” The
negress took the gold and went to the market, where she bought
all that her lady bade her buy and speedily came back, when the
Kazi’s wife arose and cooked a notable meal, after which she and
the black chattel ate whatso they wanted. Presently the slave
brought basin and ewer to her lady and washed her hands and
then fell to kissing her feet, saying, “Allah feed thee, O my lady,
even as thou hast fed me, for ever since I belonged to this Kazi I
have lacked the necessaries of life.” Replied the other, “Rejoice,
O handmaiden, for henceforth thou shalt have every day naught
but the bestest food of manifold kinds;” and the negress prayed
Allah to preserve her and thanked her. At noon the Kazi entered
and cried, “O handmaid fetch the fringed cloth,” and when she
brought it he sat down and his wife arose and served up somewhat
of the food she had cooked and he ate and rejoiced and was filled
and at last he asked, “Whence this provision?” She answered,
“I have in this city many kinsfolk who hearing of my coming sent
me these meats and quoth I to myself, When my lord the Kazi
shall return home he shall make his dinner thereof.” On the next
day she did as before and drawing out three ducats called the slave-girl
and gave her two of them bidding her go to the Bazar and buy
a lamb ready skinned and a quantity of rice and clarified butter
and greens and spices and whatso was required for dressing the
dishes. So the handmaid went forth rejoicing, and bought all her
lady had ordered and forthwith returned when her mistress fell to
cooking meats of various kinds and lastly sent to invite all her
neighbours, women and maidens. When they came she had got
ready the trays garnished with dainty food<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6885" id="noteref-6885" epub:type="noteref">6885</a> and served up to them
all that was suitable and they ate and enjoyed themselves and made
merry. Now this was about mid-forenoon, but as midday drew
near they went home carrying with them dishes full of dainties
which they cleared and washed and sent back till everything was
returned to its place.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the guests
of the Kazi’s wife fared from her before turn of sun; and, when it
was noon, behold, the Kazi entered his Harem and said, “O handmaiden,
fetch the fringed table-cloth,” when the wife arose and set
before him viands of various sorts. He asked whence they came
and she answered saying, “This is from my maternal aunt who
sent it as a present to me.” The judge ate and was delighted and
abode in the Harem till set of sun. But his wife ceased not daily
to draw money from his hoard and to expend it upon entertaining
her friends and gossips, and this endured for a whole year. Now
beside her mansion dwelt a poor woman in a mean dwelling and
every day the wife would feed her and her husband and babes;
moreover she would give them all that sufficed them. The woman
was far gone with child and the other charged her saying, “As
soon as ’tis thy time to be delivered, do thou come to me for I have
a mind to play a prank upon this Kazi who feareth not Allah and
who, whenever he taketh to himself a wife, first depriveth her of
food till she is well nigh famished, then shreddeth off her nose
under false pretences and putteth her away taking all her belongings
and giving naught of dower either the precedent or the contingent.”
And the poor woman replied, “To hear is to obey.” Then the
wife persisted in her lavish expenditure till her neighbour came to
her already overtaken by birth-pains, and these lasted but a little
while when she was brought to bed of a boy. Hereupon the
Kazi’s wife arose and prepared a savoury dish called a Baysárah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6886" id="noteref-6886" epub:type="noteref">6886</a>
the base of which is composed of beans and gravied mallows<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6887" id="noteref-6887" epub:type="noteref">6887</a>
seasoned with onions and garlic. It was noon when her husband
came in and she served up the dish; and he being anhungered ate
of it and ate greedily and at supper time he did likewise. But he
was not accustomed to a Baysárah, so as soon as night came on
his paunch began to swell; the wind bellowed in his bowels; his
stress was such that he could not be more distressed and he roared
out in his agony. Herewith his wife ran in and cried to him, “No
harm shall befal thee, O my lord!” and so saying she passed her
hand over his stomach and presently exclaimed “Extolled be He,
O my lord; verily thou art pregnant and a babe is in thy belly.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night an the
Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Kazi’s wife
came up to him and passing her palm over his paunch presently
cried, “Extolled be He, O my lord: verily thou art pregnant and
a babe is in thy belly.” Quoth the Kazi, “How shall a man bear a
child?” and quoth she, “Allah createth whatso He willeth.” And
as they two sat at talk the flatulence and belly-ache increased and
violent colic<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6888" id="noteref-6888" epub:type="noteref">6888</a> set in and the torments waxed still more torturing.
Then the wife rose up and disappeared but presently she returned
with her pauper neighbour’s newly-born babe in her sleeve, its
mother accompanying it: she also brought a large basin of copper
and she found her husband rolling from right to left and crying
aloud in his agony. At last the qualms<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6889" id="noteref-6889" epub:type="noteref">6889</a> in his stomach were
ready to burst forth and the rich food to issue from his body, and
when this delivery was near hand the wife privily set the basin
under him like a close stool and fell to calling upon the Holy
Names and to shampooing and rubbing down his skin while she
ejaculated, “The name of Allah be upon thee!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6890" id="noteref-6890" epub:type="noteref">6890</a> But all this was
of her malice. At last the prima via opened and the Kazi let fly,
whereat his wife came quickly behind and setting the babe upon
its back gently pinched it so that it began to wail, and said, “O
man Alhamdolillah,—laud to the Lord, who hath so utterly
relieved thee of thy burthen,” and she fell to muttering Names
over the new-born. Then quoth he, “Have a care of the little
one and keep it from cold draughts;” for the trick had taken
completely with the Kazi and he said in his mind, “Allah createth
whatso He willeth: even men if so predestined can bring forth.”
And presently he added, “O woman, look out for a wet nurse to
suckle him;” and she replied, “O my lord, the nurse is with me in
the women’s apartments.” Then having sent away the babe and
its mother she came up to the Kazi and washed him and removed
the basin from under him and made him lie at full length.
Presently after taking thought he said, “O woman, be careful to
keep this matter private for fear of the folk who otherwise might
say:—Our Kazi hath borne a babe.” She replied, “O my lord,
as the affair is known to other than our two selves how can we
manage to conceal it?” and after she resumed, “O my husband,
this business can on no wise be hidden from the people for more
than a week or at most till next month.” Herewith he cried out,
“O my calamity; if it reach the ears of folk and they say:—Our
Kazi hath borne a babe, then what shall we do?” He pondered
the matter until morning when he rose before daylight and, taking
some provaunt secretly, made ready to depart the city, saying,
“O Allah, suffer none to see me!” Then, after giving his wife
charge of the house and bidding her take care of his effects and
farewelling her, he went forth secretly from her and journeyed that
day and a second and a third until the seventh, when he entered
Damascus of Syria where none knew him. But he had no spending
money for he could not persuade himself to take even a single
dinar from his hoard and he had provided himself with naught save
the meagrest provision. So his condition was straitened and he
was compelled to sell somewhat of his clothes and lay out the price
upon his urgent needs; and when the coin was finished he was
forced to part with other portions of his dress till little or nothing
of it remained to him. Then, in his sorest strait, he went to the
Shaykh of the Masons and said to him, “O master, my wish is
to serve in this industry;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6891" id="noteref-6891" epub:type="noteref">6891</a> and said he, “Welcome to thee.” So
the Kazi worked through every day for a wage of five Faddahs.
Such was his case; but as regards his wife,——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on this coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was the</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of
deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the Kazi went
forth from his wife she threw a sherd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6892" id="noteref-6892" epub:type="noteref">6892</a> behind him and muttered
“Allah never bring thee back from thy journey.” Then she arose
and threw open the rooms and noted all that was in them of
moneys and moveables and <i><span xml:lang="fr">vaiselle</span></i> and rarities, and she fell to
feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and doling alms to
Fakírs saying, “This be the reward of him who mortifieth the
daughters of folk and devoureth their substance and shreddeth off
their nostrils.” She also sent to the women he had married and
divorced, and gave them of his good the equivalent of their dowers
and a solatium for losing their noses. And every day she assembled
the goodwives of the quarter and cooked for them manifold kinds
of food because her spouse the Kazi was possessed of property
approaching two Khaznahs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6893" id="noteref-6893" epub:type="noteref">6893</a> of money, he being ever loath to
expend what his hand could hend and unprepared to part with
aught on any wise, for the excess of his niggardness and his greed
of gain. Nor did she cease from so doing for a length of time
until suddenly she overheard folk saying, “Our Kazi hath borne a
babe.” And such bruit spread abroad and was reported in sundry
cities, nor ceased the rumour ere it reached the ears of the Caliph
Harun al-Rashid in Baghdad city. Now hearing it he marvelled
and cried, “Extolled be Allah! this hap, by the Lord, never can
have happened save at the hand of some woman, a wise and a
clever at contrivance; nor would she have wrought after such
fashion save to make public somewhat erst proceeding from the
Kazi, either his covetous intent or his high-handedness in commandment.
But needs must this goodwife be summoned before
me and recount the cunning practice she hath practised;—Allah
grant her success in the prank she hath played upon the Judge.”
Such was her case; but as concerns the Kazi, he abode working
at builders’ craft till his bodily force was enfeebled and his frame
became frail; so presently quoth he to himself, “Do thou return
to thy native land, for a long time hath now passed and this affair is
clean forgotten.” Thereupon he returned to Tarábulus, but as he
drew near thereto he was met outside the city by a bevy of small boys
who were playing at forfeits, and lo and behold! cried one to his
comrades, “O lads, do ye remember such and such a year when
our Kazi was brought to bed?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6894" id="noteref-6894" epub:type="noteref">6894</a> But the Judge hearing these
words returned forthright to Damascus by the way he came, saying
to himself, “Hie thee not save to Baghdad city for ’tis further
away than Damascus!” and set out at once for the House of
Peace. However he entered it privily, because he was still in the
employ of the Prince of True Believers, Harun al-Rashid; and,
changing semblance and superficials, he donned the dress of a
Persian Darwaysh and fell to walking about the streets of the
capital. Here met he sundry men of high degree who showed
him favour, but he could not venture himself before the Caliph
albe sundry of the subjects said to him, “O Darwaysh, why dost
thou not appear in the presence of the Commander of the Faithful?
Assuredly he would bestow upon thee many a boon, for he is a
true Sultan; and, specially, an thou panegyrise him in poetry, he
will largely add to his largesse.” Now by the decree of Destiny
the Viceregent of Allah upon His Earth had commanded the Kazi’s
wife be brought from Tarabulus: so they led her into the presence
and when she had kissed ground before him and salam’d to him
and prayed for the perpetuity of his glory and his existence, he
asked her anent her husband and how he had borne a child and
what was the prank she had played him and in what manner she
had gotten the better of him. She hung her head groundwards
awhile for shame nor could she return aught of reply for a time,
when the Commander of the Faithful said to her, “Thou hast my
promise of safety and again safety, the safety of one who betrayeth
not his word.” So she raised her head and cried, “By Allah, O
King of the Age, the story of this Kazi is a strange——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say.” Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
Kazi’s wife, “By Allah, O King of the Age, the story of this
Kazi is a strange and of the wonders of the world and ’tis as
follows. My spouse is so niggardly of nature and greedy of gain
that whatso wife he weddeth he starveth her with hunger and,
whenas she loseth patience, he shreddeth her nostrils and putteth
her away, taking all her good and what not. Now this case
continued for a while of time. Also he had a black slave-wench
and a fine eating-cloth and when dinner-time came he would cry,
O handmaid, fetch the fringed table-cloth! whereupon she would
bring it and garnish it with three biscuits and three onions, one to
each mouth. Presently accounts of this conduct came to me at
Mosul, whereupon I removed me to Tarábulus, and there played
him many a prank amongst which was the dish of Baysár by me
seasoned with an over quantity of onions and garlic and such spices
as gather wind in the maw and distend it like a tom-tom and breed
borborygms.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6895" id="noteref-6895" epub:type="noteref">6895</a> This I gave him to eat and then befel that which
befel. So I said to him, Thou art in the family way and
tricked him, privily bringing into the house a new-born babe.
When his belly began to drain off I set under him a large metal
basin and after pinching the little one I placed it in the utensil
and recited Names over it. Presently quoth he, Guard my little
stranger from the draught and bring hither a wet-nurse; and I
did accordingly. But he waxed ashamed of the birth and in the
morning he fared forth the city nor knew we what Allah had done
with him. But as he went I bespake him with the words which
the poet sang when the Ass of Umm Amr went off:—</p>

<p>Now as the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard these words he
laughed so hearty a laugh that he fell backwards and bade the
goodwife repeat her history till he waxed distraught for excess of
merriment, when lo and behold! a Darwaysh suddenly entered
the presence. The wife looked at her husband and recognised
him; but the Caliph knew not his Kazi, so much had time and
trouble changed the Judge’s cheer. However, she signalled to the
Commander of the Faithful that the beggar was her mate and
he taking the hint cried out, “Welcome to thee, O Darwaysh, and
where be the babe thou barest at Tarabulus?” The unfortunate
replied, “O King of the Age, do men go with child?” and the
Prince of True Believers rejoined, “We heard that the Kazi bare
a babe and thou art that same Kazi now habited in Fakir’s habit.
But who may be this woman thou seest?” He made answer
“I wot not;” but the dame exclaimed, “Why this denial, O thou
who fearest Allah so little? I conjure thee by the life of the King
to recount in his presence all that betided thee.” He could deny
it no longer so he told his tale before the Caliph, who laughed at
him aloud; and at each adventure the King cried out, “Allah
spare thee and thy child, O Kazi!” Thereupon the Judge
explained saying, “Pardon, O King of the Age, I merit even
more than what hath betided me.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the Kazi
to the King, “I deserve even more than what hath betided me for
my deeds were unrighteous, O Ruler of the Time. But now the
twain of us be present between thy hands; so do thou, of thy
generous grace and the perfection of thy beneficence, deign
reconcile me unto my wife and from this moment forwards I repent
before the face of Allah nor will I ever return to the condition I
was in of niggardise and greed of gain. But ’tis for her to decide
and on whatever wise she direct me to act, therein will I not
gainsay her; and do thou vouchsafe to me the further favour of
restoring me to the office I whilome held.” When the Prince of
True Believers, Harun al-Rashid, heard the Kazi’s words he turned
to the Judge’s wife and said, “Thou also hast heard what thy
mate hath averred: so do thou become to him what thou wast
before and thou hast command over all which thy husband requireth.”
She replied, “O King of the Age, even as thou hast the
advantage of knowing, verily the Heavens and the son of Adam
change not; for that man’s nature is never altered except with his
existence nor doth it depart from him save when his life departeth.
However, an he speak the truth let him bind himself by a deed
documented under thy personal inspection and thine own seal; so
that if he break his covenant the case may be committed to thee.”
The Caliph rejoined, “Sooth thou sayest that the nature of Adam’s
son is allied to his existence;” but the Kazi exclaimed, “O our
lord the Sultan, bid write for me the writ even as thou hast heard
from her mouth and do thou deign witness it between us twain.”
Thereupon the King reconciled their differences and allotted to
them a livelihood which would suffice and sent them both back to
Tarabulus-town. This is all that hath come down to us concerning
the Kazi who bare a babe: yet ’tis as naught compared with the
tale of the Bhang-eaters, for their story is wondrous and their adventures
delectable and marvellous. “What may it be?” asked
Shahryar; so Shahrazad began to recount</p>
