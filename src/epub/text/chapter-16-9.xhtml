    <div><b>Here we begin to indite the History of Sultan Habib and of what befel him with Durrat al-Ghawwas.</b><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8124" id="noteref-8124" epub:type="noteref">8124</a></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It is related (but Allah is All-knowing of His unknown and
All-cognisant of what took place and forewent in the annals of
folk!) that there was, in days of yore and in times and tides long
gone before, a tribe of the tribes of the Arabs hight Banú Hilál<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8125" id="noteref-8125" epub:type="noteref">8125</a>
whose head men were the Emir Hilál and the Emir Salámah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8126" id="noteref-8126" epub:type="noteref">8126</a>
Now this Emir Salamah had well nigh told out his tale of days
without having been blessed with boon of child; withal he was
a ruler valiant, masterful, a fender of his foes and a noble knight
of portly presence. He numbered by the thousand horsemen the
notablest of cavaliers and he came to overrule three-score-and-six
tribes of the Arabs. One chance night of the nights as he lay
sleeping in the sweetness of slumber, a Voice addressed him
saying, “Rise forthright and know thy wife, whereby she shall
conceive under command of Allah Almighty.” Being thus disturbed
of his rest the Emir sprang up and compressed his spouse
Kamar al-Ashráf;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8127" id="noteref-8127" epub:type="noteref">8127</a> she became pregnant by that embrace and
when her days came to an end she bare a boy as the full moon
of the fulness-night who by his father’s hest was named Habíb.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8128" id="noteref-8128" epub:type="noteref">8128</a>
And as time went on his sire rejoiced in him with joy exceeding
and reared him with fairest rearing and bade them teach him
Koran-reading together with the glorious names of Almighty
Allah and instruct him in writing and in all the arts and sciences.
After this he bestowed robes of honour and gifts of money and
raiment upon the teachers who had made the Sultan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8129" id="noteref-8129" epub:type="noteref">8129</a> Habib,
when he reached the age of seventeen, the most intelligent and
penetrating and knowing amongst the sons of his time. And
indeed men used to admire at the largeness of his understanding
and were wont to say in themselves, “There is no help but that
this youth shall rise to dignity (and what dignity!) whereof men
of highmost intellect shall make loud mention. For he could
write the seven caligraphs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8130" id="noteref-8130" epub:type="noteref">8130</a> and he could recite traditions and
he could improvise poetry; and, on one occasion when his father
bade him versify impromptu, that he might see what might come
thereof, he intoned:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my sire, I am lord of all lere man knows or knew— ✿ Have enformed my vitals with lore and with legend true;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor cease I repeat what knowledge this memory guards ✿ And my writ as ruby and pearl doth appear to view.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So the Emir Salamah his sire marvelled at the elegance of his
son’s diction; and the Notables of the clan, after hearing his
poetry and his prose, stood astounded at their excellence; and
presently the father clasped his child to his breast and forthright
summoned his governor, to whom there and then he did honour
of the highmost. Moreover he largessed him with four camels
carrying loads of gold and silver and he set him over one of his
subject tribes of the Arabs; then said he to him, “Indeed thou
hast done well, O Shaykh; so take this good and fare therewith
to such a tribe and rule it with justice and equity until the day of
thy death.” Replied the governor, “O King of the Age, I may on
no wise accept thy boons, for that I am not of mankind but of
Jinn-kind; nor have I need of money or requirement of rule. Know
thou, O my lord, that erst I sat as Kázi amongst the Jinns and I
was enthroned amid the Kings of the Jánn, whenas one night of
the nights a Voice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8131" id="noteref-8131" epub:type="noteref">8131</a> addressed me in my sleep saying, “Rise and
hie thee to the Sultan Habib son of the Emir Salamah ruler of
the tribes of the Arabs subject to the Banu Hilal and become
his tutor and teach him all things teachable; and, if thou gainsay
going, I will tear thy soul from thy body.” Now when I saw
this marvel-vision in my sleep, I straightway arose and repairing
to thy son did as I was bidden.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8132" id="noteref-8132" epub:type="noteref">8132</a> But as the Emir Salamah
heard the words of this Shaykh he bowed him down and kissing
his feet cried, “Alhamdolillah—laud to the Lord, who hath
vouchsafed thee to us of His bounty; and indeed thy coming
to us was of good omen, O Judge of the Jann.” “Where is thy
son?” quoth the governor and quoth the father, “Ready, aye
ready;” then he summoned his child and when the Shaykh
looked upon his pupil he wept with sore weeping and cried,
“Parting from thee, O Habib, is heavy upon us,” presently
adding, “Ah! were ye to wot all that shall soon befal this
youth after my departure and when afar from me!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8133" id="noteref-8133" epub:type="noteref">8133</a> Those
present in the assembly at once asked saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And what shall, O Shaykh, to us fall forthright? ✿ Quoth he, ‘Sore marvels shall meet your sight’:</div>
      <div class="line">No heart have I to describe it you”. ✿ Then approached Habib the same tutor-wight;</div>
      <div class="line">And clasping the youth to the breast of him, ✿ Kissed his cheek a-shrieking the shrillest shright.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8134" id="noteref-8134" epub:type="noteref">8134</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Whereupon all about them were perturbed and were amated and
amazed at the action of the Shaykh when, vanishing from their
view, he could nowhere be seen. Then the Emir Salamah addressed
the lieges saying, “Ho ye Arabs, who wotteth what
presently shall betide my son? would Heaven I had one to
advise him!” Hereupon said his Elders and Councillors, “We
know of none.” But the Sultan Habib brooded over the disappearance
of his governor and bespake his sire weeping bitter
tears the while, “O my father, where be he who brought me up
and enformed me with all manner knowledge?” and the Emir
replied, “O my son, one day of the days he farewelled us and
crying out with a loud cry evanished from our view and we
have seen him no more.” Thereupon the youth improvised and
said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed I am scourged by those ills whereof I felt affray, ah! ✿ By parting and thoughts which oft compelled my soul to say, ‘Ah!’</div>
      <div class="line">Oh saddest regret in vitals of me that ne’er ceaseth, nor ✿ Shall minished be his love that still on my heart doth prey, ah!</div>
      <div class="line">Where hath hied the generous soul my mind with lere adorned? ✿ And alas! what hath happened, O sire, to me, and well-away, ah!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hereat the Emir Salamah shed tears (as on like wise did all
present) and quoth he to his son, “O Habib, we have been
troubled by his action,” and quoth the youth, “How shall I
endure severance from one who fostered me and brought me to
honour and renown and who raised my degree so high?” Then
began he to improvise saying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed this pine in my heart grows high, ✿ And in eyeballs wake doth my sleep outvie:</div>
      <div class="line">You marched, O my lords, and from me hied far ✿ And you left a lover shall aye outcry:</div>
      <div class="line">I wot not where on this earth you be ✿ And how long this patience when none is nigh:</div>
      <div class="line">Ye fared and my eyeballs your absence weep, ✿ And my frame is meagre, my heart is dry.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now whilst the Emir Salamah was sitting in his seat of dignity
and the Sultan Habib was improvising poetry and shedding tears
in presence of his sire, they heard a Voice which announced itself
and its sound was audible whilst its personality was invisible.
Thereupon the youth shed tears and cried, “O father mine, I need
one who shall teach me horsemanship and the accidents of edge
and point and onset and offset and spearing and spurring in the
Maydán; for my heart loveth knightly derring-do to plan, such
as riding in van and encountering the horseman and the valiant
man.” And the while they were in such converse behold, there
appeared before them a personage rounded of head, long of
length and dread, with turband wide dispread, and his breadth
of breast was armoured with doubled coat of mail whose manifold
rings were close-enmeshed after the model of Dáúd<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8135" id="noteref-8135" epub:type="noteref">8135</a> the
Prophet (upon whom be The Peace!) Moreover he hent in
hand a mace erst a block cut out of the live hard rock, whose
shock would arrest forty braves of the doughtiest; and he was
baldrick’d with an Indian blade that quivered in the grasp,
and he bestrode, with a Samhari<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8136" id="noteref-8136" epub:type="noteref">8136</a> lance at rest, a bay destrier
of black points whose peer was not amongst the steeds of the
Arabs. Then he took his station standing as a vassal between
the Emir Salamah’s hands and he addressed a general salam and
he greeted all that stood afoot or were seated. His salute they
repeated and presently the pages hastened forwards and aided
him alight from his charger’s back; and after waiting for a full-told
hour that he might take somewhat of repose, the stranger-knight
and doughty wight advanced and said, “Ho thou the
Emir, I came hither to fulfil the want whereof thou expressedst a
wish; and, if such prove thy pleasure, I will teach thy son fray and
fight and prowess in the plain of sword-stroke and lance-lunge.
But ere so doing I would fain test thy skill in cavalarice; so
do thou, O Emir, be first to appear as champion and single combatant
in the field when I will show thee what horsemanship is.”
“Hearkening and obeying,” replied the Emir, “and if thou desire
the duello with us we will not baulk thee thereof.” Hereat his
Shaykhs and Chieftains sprang up and cried to him, “O Emir,
Allah upon thee do not meet in fight this cavalier for that thou
wottest not an he be of mankind or of Jinn-kind; so be thou not
deceived by his sleights and snares.” “Suffer me this day,” quoth
the Emir, “to see the cavalarice of this cavalier, and, if over me
he prevail, know him to be a knight with whom none may avail.”
Speaking thus the Emir arose and hied him to his tent where he
bade the slaves bring forth the best of his habergeons; and, when
all these were set before him, he took from them a Davidian suit
of manifold rings and close-meshed, which he donned, and he
baldrick’d himself with a scymitar of Hindi steel, hadst thou
smitten therewith a cliff it had cleft it in twain or hadst thou
stricken a hill it had been laid level as a plain; and he hent in
hand a Rudaynían lance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8137" id="noteref-8137" epub:type="noteref">8137</a> of Khatt Hajar, whose length was thirty
ells and upon whose head sat a point like unto a basilisk’s tongue;
and lastly he bade his slaves bring him his courser which in the
race was the fleetest-footed of all horses. Then the two combatants
took the plain accompanied by the tribesmen nor did one
of them all, or great or small, remain in camp for desire to witness
the fight of these champions who were both as ravening lions.
But first the stranger-knight addressed his adversary and speaking
with free and eloquent tongue quoth he, “I will encounter thee,
O Emir Salamah, with the encountering of the valiant; so have
thou a heed of me for I am he hath overthrown the Champions
some and all.” At these words each engaged his foeman and
the twain forwards pressed for a long time, and the Raven of
cut-and-thrust croaked over the field of fight and they exchanged
strokes with the Hindi scymitar and they thrust and foined with
the Khatti spear and more than one blade and limber lance was
shivered and splintered, all the tribesmen looking on the while
at both. And they ceased not to attack and retire and to
draw near and draw off and to heave and fence until their forearms
ailed and their endeavour failed. Already there appeared in
the Emir Salamah somewhat of weakness and weariness; natheless
when he looked upon his adversary’s skill in the tourney
and encounter of braves he saw how to meet all the foeman’s
sword-strokes with his targe: however at last fatigue and loss of
strength prevailed over him and he knew that he had no longer
the force to fight; so he stinted his endeavour and withdrew from
brunt of battle. Hereat the stranger knight alighted and falling
at the Emir’s feet kissed them and cried, “O Sovran of the Age,
I came not hither to war with thee but rather with the design of
teaching thy son, the Sultan Habib, the complete art of arms and
make him the prow cavalier of his day.” Replied Salamah, “In
very sooth, O horseman of the age, thou hast spoken right fairly
in thy speech; nor did I design with thee to fight nor devised I
the duello or from steed to alight;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8138" id="noteref-8138" epub:type="noteref">8138</a> nay, my sole object was my
son to incite that he might learn battle and combat aright, and the
charge of the heroic Himyarite<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8139" id="noteref-8139" epub:type="noteref">8139</a> to meet with might.” Then the
twain dismounted and each kissed his adversary; after which they
returned to the tribal camp and the Emir bade decorate it and all
the habitations of the Arab clans with choicest decoration, and
they slaughtered the victims and spread the banquets and throughout
that day the tribesmen ate and drank and fed the travellers
and every wayfarer and the mean and mesquin and all the
miserables. Now as soon as the Sultan Habib was informed
concerning that cavalier how he had foiled his father in the field
of fight, he repaired to him and said, “Peace be with him who
came longing for us and designing our society! Who art thou,
Ho thou the valorous knight and foiler of foemen in fight?”
Said the other, “Learn thou, O Habib, that Allah hath sent me
theewards.” “And, say me, what may be thy name?” “I am
hight Al-’Abbús,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8140" id="noteref-8140" epub:type="noteref">8140</a> the Knight of the Grim Face.” “I see thee
only smiling of countenance whilst thy name clean contradicteth
thy nature;” quoth the youth. Presently the Emir Salamah
committed his son to the new governor saying, “I would thou
make me this youth <em>the</em> Brave of his epoch;” whereto the knight
replied, “To hear is to obey, first Allah then thyself and to do
suit and service of thy son Habib.” And when this was determined
youth and governor went forth to the Maydan every day
and after a while of delay Habib became the best man of his age
in fight and fray. Seeing this his teacher addressed him as
follows. “Learn, O Sultan Habib, that there is no help but
thou witness perils and affrights and adventures, wherefor is weak
the description of describers and thou shalt say in thyself:—Would
heaven I had never sighted such and I were of these same
free. And thou shalt fall into every hardship and horror until
thou be united with the beautiful Durrat al-Ghawwás, Queen-regnant
over the Isles of the Sea. Meanwhile to affront all the
perils of the path thou shalt fare forth from thy folk and bid
adieu to thy tribe and patrial stead; and, after enduring that
which amateth man’s wit, thou shalt win union with the daughter
of Queen Kamar al-Zamán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8141" id="noteref-8141" epub:type="noteref">8141</a>.” But when Habib heard these
words concerning the “Pearl of the Diver” his wits were wildered
and his senses were agitated and he cried to Al-Abbus, “I
conjure thee by Allah say me, is this damsel of mankind or of
Jinn-kind.” Quoth the other, “Of Jinn-kind, and she hath two
Wazirs, one of either race, who overrule all her rulers and a
thousand islands of the Isles of the Sea are subject to her
command, while a host of Sayyids and Sharífs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8142" id="noteref-8142" epub:type="noteref">8142</a> and Grandees
hath flocked to woo her, bringing wealthy gifts and noble presents,
yet hath not any of them won his wish of her but all returned
baffled and baulked of their will.” Now the Sultan Habib
hearing this from him cried in excess of perturbation and stress
of confusion, “Up with us and hie we home where we may take
seat and talk over such troublous matter and debate anent its
past and its future.” “Hearkening and obedience,” rejoined the
other; so the twain retired into privacy in order to converse at
ease concerning the Princess, and Al-Abbus began to relate in
these words—</p>

<div>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>THE HISTORY OF DURRAT AL-GHAWWAS.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">Whilome there was a Sovran amongst the Kings of the Sea,
hight Sábúr, who reigned over the Crystalline Isles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8143" id="noteref-8143" epub:type="noteref">8143</a> and he was
a mighty ruler and a generous, and a masterful potentate and
a glorious. He loved women and he was at trouble to seek out
the fairest damsels; yet many of his years had gone by nor
yet had he been blessed with boon of boy. So one day of the
days he took thought and said in himself, “To this length of
years I have attained and am well nigh at life’s end and still
am I childless: what then will be my case?” Presently, as he
sat upon his throne of kingship, he saw enter to him an Ifrit fair
of face and form, the which was none other than King ’Atrús<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8144" id="noteref-8144" epub:type="noteref">8144</a>
of the Jánn, who cried, “The Peace be upon thee, Ho thou the
King! and know that I have come to thee from my liege lord
who affecteth thee. In my sleep it befel that I heard a Voice
crying to me:—During all the King’s days never hath he been
vouchsafed a child, boy or girl; so now let him accept my command
and he shall win to his wish. Let him distribute justice
and largesse and further the rights of the wronged and bid men
to good and forbid them from evil and lend not aid to tyranny
or to innovation in the realm and persecute not the unfortunate,
and release from gaol all the prisoners he retaineth. At these
words of the Voice I awoke astartled by my vision and I hastened
to thee without delay and I come with design to inform thee,
O King of the Age, that I have a daughter, hight Kamar al-Zaman,
who hath none like her in her time, and no peer in this tide, and
her I design giving thee to bride. The Kings of the Jann have
ofttimes asked her in marriage of me but I would have none of
them save a ruler of men like thyself and Alhamdolillah—glory
be to God, who caused thy Highness occur to my thought, for
that thy fame in the world is goodly fair and thy works make
for righteousness. And haply by the blessing of these thou shalt
beget upon my daughter a man child, a pious heir and a virtuous.”
Replied the King, “Ho thou who comest to us and desirest
our weal, I accept thine offer with love and good will.” Then
Sabur, the King of the Crystalline Isles, bade summon the Kazi
and witnesses, and quoth the Ifrit, “I agree to what thou sayest,
and whatso thou proposest that will I not oppose.” So they
determined upon the dowry and bound him by the bond of
marriage with the daughter of Al-’Atrus, King of the Jinns, who
at once sent one of his Flying Jann to bring the bride. She
arrived forthright when they dressed and adorned her with all
manner ornaments, and she came forth surpassing all the maidens
of her era. And when King Sabur went in unto her he found
her a clean maid: so he lay that night with her and Almighty
Allah so willed that she conceived of him. When her days and
months of pregnancy were sped, she was delivered of a girl-babe
as the moon, whom they committed to wet-nurses and dry-nurses,
and when she had reached her tenth year, they set over
her duennas who taught her Koran-reading and writing and
learning and <em>belles-lettres</em>; brief, they brought her up after the
fairest of fashions. Such was the lot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8145" id="noteref-8145" epub:type="noteref">8145</a> of Durrat al-Ghawwas,
the child of Kamar al-Zaman, daughter to King ’Atrus by her
husband King Sabur. But as regards the Sultan Habib and his
governor Al-Abbus, the twain ceased not wandering from place
to place in search of the promised damsel until one day of the
days when the youth entered his father’s garden and strolled the
walks adown amid the borders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8146" id="noteref-8146" epub:type="noteref">8146</a> and blossoms of basil and of
rose full blown and solaced himself with the works of the Compassionate
One and enjoyed the scents and savours of the flowers
there bestrown; and, while thus employed, behold, he suddenly
espied the maiden, Durrat al-Ghawwas hight, entering therein as
she were the moon; and naught could be lovelier than she of all
earth supplies, gracious as a Huriyah of the Virgins of Paradise,
to whose praise no praiser could avail on any wise. But when the
Sultan Habib cast upon her his eyes he could no longer master
himself and his wits were bewildered from the excitement of his
thoughts; so he regarded her with a long fixed look and said in
himself, “I fear whenas she see me that she will vanish from my
sight.” Accordingly, he retired and clomb the branches of a tree in
a stead where he could not be seen and whence he could see her
at his ease. But as regards the Princess, she ceased not to roam
about the Emir Salamah’s garden until there approached her two
score of snow-white birds each accompanied by a handmaid of
moon-like beauty. Presently they settled upon the ground and
stood between her hands saying, “Peace be upon thee, O our
Queen and Sovran Lady.” She replied, “No welcome to you and
no greeting; say me, what delayed you until this hour when ye
know that I am longing to meet the Sultan Habib, the dear one,
son of Salamah, and I long to visit him for that he is the dearling
of my heart. Wherefor I bade you accompany me and ye obeyed
not, and haply ye have made mock of me and of my commandment.”
“We never gainsay thy behest,” replied they, “or in word
or in deed;” and they fell to seeking her beloved. Hearing this
the Sultan Habib’s heart was solaced and his mind was comforted
and his thoughts were rightly directed and his soul was reposed;
and when he was certified of her speech, he was minded to appear
before her; but suddenly fear of her prevailed over him and he
said to his thoughts, “Haply she will order one of the Jinns to
do me die; so ’twere better to have patience and see what Allah
shall purpose for me of His Almighty will.” But the Princess
and her attendants ceased not wandering about the garden from
site to site and side to side till they reached the place wherein
the Sultan Habib lay in lurking; when Durrat al-Ghawwas there
stood still and said in herself, “Now I came not from my capital
save on his account, and I would see and be seen by him even
as the Voice informed me of him, O ye handmaidens; and
peradventure hath the same informed him of me.” Then the
Princess and her suite, drawing still nearer to his place of concealment,
found a lakelet in the Arab’s garden brimful of water
amiddlemost whereof stood a brazen lion, through whose mouth
the water entered to issue from his tail. Hereat the Princess
marvelled and said to her bondswomen, “This be none other
than a marvellous lake, together with the lion therein; and when,
by the goodwill of Almighty Allah, I shall have returned home
I will let make a lakelet after this fashion, and in it set a lion of
brass.” Thereupon she ordered them to doff their dress and go
down to the piece of water and swim about; but they replied,
“O our lady, to hear is to obey thy commandment, but we will
not strip nor swim save with thee.” Then she also did off her
dress and all stripped themselves and entered the lakelet in a
body, whereupon the Sultan Habib looked through the leaves to
solace himself with the fair spectacle and he ejaculated, “Blessed
be the Lord the best of Creators!” And when the handmaids
waxed aweary of swimming, the Princess commanded them to
come forth the water, and said “Whenas Heaven willeth that the
desire of my heart be fulfilled in this garden, what deem ye I
should do with my lover?” and quoth they, “’Twould only add
to our pleasure and gladness.” Quoth she, “Verily my heart
assureth me that he is here and hidden amongst the trees of yon
tangled brake;” and she made signs with her hand whither
Habib lay in lurking-place; and he, espying this, rejoiced with
joy galore than which naught could be more, and exclaimed,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great: what meaneth this lady? Indeed, I fear
to stay in this stead lest she come hither and draw me forth and
put me to shame; and ’twere better that of mine own accord
I come out of my concealment and accost her and suffer her to do
all she designeth and desireth.” So he descended from the
topmost of the tree wherein he had taken refuge and presented
himself before the Princess Durrat al-Ghawwas, who drew near
and cried to him, “O Habib, O welcome to Habib! and is it thus
that we have travailed with love of thee and longing for thee, and
where hast thou been all this time, O my dearling, and O coolth
of my eyes and O slice of my liver?” Replied he, “I was in
the head of yonder huge tree to which thou pointedst with thy
finger.” And as they looked each at other she drew nearer to him
and fell to improvising:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou hast doomed me, O branchlet of Bán, to despair ✿ Who in worship and honour was wont to fare,—</div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_c236a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />

<p>And anon quoth the Sultan Habib; “Alhamdolillah—laud be to
the Lord, who deigned show me thy face and thy form! Can it
be thou kennest not what it was that harmed me and sickened
me for thy sake, O Durrat al-Ghawwas?” Quoth she, “And what
was it hurt thee and ailed thee?” “It was the love of thee and
longing for thee!” “And who was the first to tell thee and make
thee ware of me?” He replied saying, “One day it so befel, as
I was amongst my family and my tribe, a Jinni Al-Abbus hight
became my governor and taught me the accidents of thrust and
cut and cavalarice; and ere he left he commended thy beauty and
loveliness and foretold to me all that would pass between thee and
me. So I was engrossed with affection for thee ere my eyes had
sight of thee, and thenceforwards I lost all the pleasures of sleep,
nor were meat and eating sweet to me, nor were drink and winedraughts
a delight to me: so Alhamdolillah—praise be to Allah,
who deigned conjoin me in such union with my heart’s desire!”
Hereat the twain exchanged an embrace so long that a swoon
came upon them and both fell to the ground in a fainting fit, but
after a time the handmaidens raised them up and besprinkled their
faces with rose-water which at once revived them. All this
happened, withal the Emir Salamah wotted naught of what had
befallen his son the Sultan Habib nor did his mother weet that
had betided her child; and the husband presently went in to his
spouse and said, “Indeed this boy hath worn us out: we see that
o’ nights he sleepeth not in his own place and this day he fared
forth with the dawn and suffered us not to see a sight of him.”
Quoth the wife, “Since the day he went to Al-Abbus, thy boy
fell into cark and care;” and quoth the husband, “Verily our son
walked about the garden and Allah knoweth that therefrom is no
issue anywhither. So there shalt thou find him and ask him of
himself.” And they talked over this matter in sore anger and
agitation. Meanwhile as the Sultan Habib sat in the garden with
the handmaids waiting upon him and upon the Princess Durrat
al-Ghawwas, there suddenly swooped upon them a huge bird which
presently changed form to a Shaykh seemly of aspect and
semblance who approached and kissing their feet humbled himself
before the lover and his beloved. The youth marvelled at such
action of the Shaykh, and signalled to the Princess as to ask,
“Who may be this old man?” and she answered in the same way,
“This is the Wazir who caused me forgather with thee;” presently
adding to the Shaykh, “What may be thy need?” “I came hither
for the sake of thee,” he replied, “and unless thou fare forthright
to thy country and kingdom the rule of the Jánn will pass from
thy hand; for that the Lords of the land and Grandees of the
realm seek thy loss and not a few of the nobles have asked me
saying, O Wazir, where is our Queen? I answered, She is within
her palace and to-day she is busied with some business. But such
pretext cannot long avail, and thou, unless thou return with me to
the region of thy reign there shall betray thee some one of the
Marids and the hosts will revolt against thee and thy rule will go
to ruin and thou wilt be degraded from command and sultanat.”
“What then is thy say and what thy bidding?” enquired she, and
he replied, “Thou hast none other way save departure from this
place and return to thy realm.” Now when these words reached
the ear of Durrat al-Ghawwas, her breast was straitened and she
waxed sorrowful with exceeding sorrow for severance from her
lover whom she addressed in these words, “What sayest thou anent
that thou hast heard? In very sooth I desire not parting from
thee and the ruin of my reign as little do I design; so come with
me, O dearling of my heart, and I will make thee liege lord over
the Isles of the Sea and sole master thereof.” Hereat the Sultan
Habib said in his soul, “I cannot endure parting from my own
people; but as for thee thy love shall never depart from thee:” then
he spake aloud, “An thou deign hear me, do thou abandon that
which thou purposest and bid thy Wazir rule over the Isles and thy
patrial stead; so shall we twain, I and thou, live in privacy for
all time and enjoy the most joyous of lives.” “That may never
be,” was her only reply; after which she cried to the Wazir
saying, “Carry me off that I fare to my own land.” Then after
farewelling her lover, she mounted the Emir-Wazir’s back<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8147" id="noteref-8147" epub:type="noteref">8147</a> and
bade him bear<a id="t240"></a> her away, whereat he took flight and the forty
handmaidens flew with him, towering high in air. Presently,
the Sultan Habib shed bitter tears; his mother hearing him weeping
sore as he sat in the garden went to her husband and said,
“Knowest thou not what calamity hath befallen thy son that I
hear him there groaning and moaning?” Now when the parents
entered the garden, they found him spent with grief and the tears
trickled adown his cheeks like never-ceasing rain-showers;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8148" id="noteref-8148" epub:type="noteref">8148</a> so they
summoned the pages who brought cucurbits of rose-water wherewith
they besprinkled his face. But as soon as he recovered his
senses and opened his eyes, he fell to weeping with excessive
weeping and his father and mother likewise shed tears for the
burning of their hearts and asked him, “O Habib, what calamity
hath come down to thee and who of his mischief hath overthrown
thee? Inform us of the truth of thy case.” So he related all
that had betided between him and Durrat al-Ghawwas, and his
mother wept over him while his father cried, “O Habib, do thou
leave this say and this thy desire cast away that the joys of meat
and drink and sleep thou may enjoy alway.” But he made answer,
“O my sire, I will not slumber upon this matter until I shall sleep
the sleep of death.” “Arise thou, O my child,” rejoined the
Emir, “and let us return homewards,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8149" id="noteref-8149" epub:type="noteref">8149</a> but the son retorted
“Verily I will not depart from this place wherein I was parted
from the dearling of my heart.” So the sire again urged him
saying, “These words do thou spare nor persist in this affair
because therefrom for thee I fear;” and he fell to cheering him
and comforting his spirits. After a while the Sultan Habib arose
and fared homewards beside his sire who kept saying to him,
“Patience, O my child, the while I assist thee in thy search for
this young lady and I send those who shall bring her to thee.”
“O my father,” rejoined the son, “I can no longer endure parting
from her; nay, ’tis my desire that thou load me sundry camels
with gold and silver and plunder and moneys that I may go forth
to seek her: and if I win to my wish and Allah vouchsafe me
length of life I will return unto you; but an the term of my days
be at hand then the behest be to Allah, the One, the Omnipotent.
Let not your breasts be straitened therefor and do ye hold and
believe that if I abide with you and see not the beloved of my soul
I shall perish of my pain while you be standing by to look upon
my death. So suffer me to wayfare and attain mine aim; for from
the day when my mother bare me ’twas written to my lot that I
journey over wild and wold and that I see and voyage over the
seas seven-fold.” Hereupon he fell to improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My heart is straitened with grief amain ✿ And my friends and familiars have wrought me pain;</div>
      <div class="line">And whene’er you’re absent I pine, and fires ✿ In my heart beweep what it bears of bane:</div>
      <div class="line">O ye, who fare for the tribe’s domain, ✿ Cry aloud my greetings to friends so fain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when the Emir Salamah heard these his son’s verses, he bade
pack for him four camel loads of the rarest stuffs, and he largessed
to him a she-dromedary laden with thrones of red gold; then he
said to him, “Lo, O my son, I have given thee more than thou
askedst.” “O my father,” replied Habib, “where are my steed
and my sword and my spear?” Hereat the pages brought forward
a mail-coat Davidian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8150" id="noteref-8150" epub:type="noteref">8150</a> and a blade Maghrabian and a lance Khattian
and Samharian, and set them between his hands; and the
Sultan Habib donning the habergeon and drawing his sabre and
sitting lance in rest backed his steed, which was of the noblest
blood known to all the Arabs. Then quoth he, “O my father is
it thy desire to send with me a troop of twenty knights that they
may escort me to the land of Al-Yaman and may anon bring me
back to thee?” “My design,” quoth the sire, “is to despatch those
with thee who shall befriend thee upon the road;” and, when
Habib prayed him do as he pleased, the Emir appointed to him
ten knights, valorous wights, who dreaded naught of death however
sudden and awesome. Presently, the youth farewelled his
father and mother, his family and his tribe, and joining his escort,
mounted his destrier when Salamah, his sire, said to his company,
“Be ye to my son obedient in all he shall command you;” and
said they, “Hearing and obeying.” Then Habib and his many
turned away from home and addressed them to the road when
he began to improvise the following lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My longing grows less and far goes my cark ✿ After flamed my heart with the love-fire stark;</div>
      <div class="line">As I ride to search for my soul’s desire ✿ And I ask of those faring to Al-Irák.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>On this wise it befel the Sultan Habib and his farewelling his
father and mother; but now lend ear to what came of the knights
who escorted him. After many days of toil and travail they waxed
discontented and disheartened; and presently taking counsel one
with other, they said, “Come, let us slay this lad and carry off the
loads of stuffs and coin he hath with him; and when we reach our
homes and be questioned concerning him, let us say that he died
of the excess of his desire to Princess Durrat al-Ghawwas.” So
they followed this rede, while their lord wotted naught of the
ambush laid for him by his followers. And having ridden through
the day when the night of offence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8151" id="noteref-8151" epub:type="noteref">8151</a> was dispread, the escort said,
“Dismount we in this garden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8152" id="noteref-8152" epub:type="noteref">8152</a> that here we may take our rest
during the dark hours, and when morning shall morrow we will
resume our road.” The Sultan Habib had no mind to oppose
them, so all alighted and in that garden took seat and whatso of
victual was with them produced; after which they ate and drank
their sufficiency and lay down to sleep all of them save their lord,
who could not close eye for excess of love-longing. “O Habib,
why and wherefore sleepest thou not?” they asked, and he
answered, “O comrades mine, how shall slumber come to one
yearning for his dearling, and verily I will lie awake nor enjoy
aught repose until such time as I espy the life-blood of my heart,
Durrat al-Ghawwas.” Thereupon they held their peace; and
presently they held council one with other saying, “Who amongst
us can supply a dose of Bhang that we may cast him asleep and
his slaughter may be easy to us?” “I have two Miskáls weight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8153" id="noteref-8153" epub:type="noteref">8153</a>
of that same,” quoth one of them, and the others took it from him
and presently, when occasion served, they put it into a cup of water
and presented it to Habib. He hent that cup in hand and drank
off the drugged liquid at a single draught; and presently the Bhang
wrought in his vitals and its fumes mounted to his head, mastering
his senses and causing his brain to whirl round, whereupon he sank
into the depths of unconsciousness. Then quoth his escort, “As
soon as his slumber is soundest and his sleep heaviest we will arise
and slay him and bury him on the spot where he now sleepeth:
then will we return to his father and mother, and tell them that of
love-stress to his beloved and of excessive longing and pining for
her he died.” And upon this deed of treachery all agreed. So
when dawned the day and showed its sheen and shone clear and
serene, the knights awoke and seeing their lord drowned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8154" id="noteref-8154" epub:type="noteref">8154</a> in sleep
they arose and sat in council, and quoth one of them, “Let us cut
his throat from ear to ear;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8155" id="noteref-8155" epub:type="noteref">8155</a> and quoth another, “Nay, better we
dig us a pit the stature of a man and we will cast him amiddlemost
thereof and heap upon him earth so that he will die, nor shall
any know aught about him.” Hearing this said one of the retinue,
whose name was Rabí’a,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8156" id="noteref-8156" epub:type="noteref">8156</a> “But fear you naught from Almighty
Allah and regard ye not the favours wherewith his father fulfilled
you, and remember ye not the bread which ye ate in his household
and from his family? Indeed ’twas but a little while since his sire
chose you out to escort him that his son might take solace with
you instead of himself, and he entrusted unto you his heart’s core,
and now ye are pleased to do him die and thereby destroy the life
of his parents. Furthermore, say me doth your judgment decide
that such ill-work can possibly abide hidden from his father? Now
I swear by the loyalty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8157" id="noteref-8157" epub:type="noteref">8157</a> of the Arabs there will not remain for us a
wight or any who bloweth the fire alight, however mean and slight,
who will receive us after such deed. So do ye at least befriend and
protect your households and your clans and your wives and your
children whom ye left in the tribal domain. But now you design
utterly to destroy us, one and all, and after death affix to our
memories the ill-name of traitors, and cause our women be enslaved
and our children enthralled, nor leave one of us aught to be longed
for.” Quoth they jeeringly, “Bring what thou hast of righteous
rede:” so quoth he, “Have you fixed your intent upon slaying
him and robbing his good?” and they answered, “We have.”
However, he objected again and cried, “Come ye and hear from
me what it is I advise you, albeit I will take no part<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8158" id="noteref-8158" epub:type="noteref">8158</a> in this
matter;” presently adding, “Established is your resolve in this
affair, and ye wot better than I what you are about to do. But
my mind is certified of this much; do ye not transgress in the
matter of his blood and suffer only his crime be upon you;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8159" id="noteref-8159" epub:type="noteref">8159</a> moreover,
if ye desire to lay hands upon his camels and his moneys and
his provisions, then do ye carry them off and leave him where he
lieth; then if he live, ’twere well, and if he die ’twill be even better
and far better.” “Thy rede is right and righteous,” they replied.
Accordingly they seized his steed and his habergeon and his sword
and his gear of battle and combat, and they carried off all he had
of money and means, and placing him naked upon the bare ground
they drove away his camels. Presently asked one of other,
“Whenas we shall reach the tribe what shall we say to his father
and his mother?” “Whatso Rabi’a shall counsel us,” quoth they,
and quoth Rabi’a, “Tell them:—We left not travelling with
your son; and, as we fared along we lost sight of him and we
saw him nowhere until we came upon him a-swoon and lying
on the road senseless: then we called to him by name but he
returned no reply, and when we shook him with our hands
behold, he had become a dried-up wand. Then seeing him dead
we buried him and brought back to you his good and his belongings.”
“And if they ask you,” objected one:—In what place did
ye bury him and in what land, and is the spot far or near, what
shall ye make answer; also if they say to you, “Why did ye not
bear his corpse with you, what then shall be your reply?” Rabi’a
to this rejoined, “Do you say to them:—Our strength was
weakened and we waxed feeble from burn of heart and want of
water, nor could we bring his remains with us. And if they ask
you:—Could ye not bear him a-back; nay, might ye not have
carried him upon one of the camels? do ye declare that ye could
not for two reasons, the first being that the body was swollen and
stinking from the fiery air, and the second our fear for his father,
lest seeing him rotten he could not endure the sight and his sorrow
be increased for that he was an only child and his sire hath none
other.” All the men joined in accepting this counsel of Rabi’a,
and each and every exclaimed, “This indeed is the rede that is
most right.” Then they ceased not wayfaring until they reached
the neighbourhood of the tribe, when they sprang from their steeds
and openly donned black, and they entered the camp showing the
sorest sorrow. Presently they repaired to the father’s tent, grieving
and weeping and shrieking as they went; and when the Emir
Salamah saw them in this case, crowding together with keening
and crying for the departed, he asked them, “Where is he, my
son?” and they answered, “Indeed he is dead.” Right hard upon
Salamah was this lie, and his grief grew the greater, so he scattered
dust upon his head and plucked out his beard and rent his raiment
and shrieked aloud saying, “Woe for my son, ah! Woe for Habib,
ah! Woe for the slice of my liver, ah! Woe for my grief, ah!
Woe for the core<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8160" id="noteref-8160" epub:type="noteref">8160</a> of my heart, ah!” Thereupon his mother
came forth, and seeing her husband in this case, with dust on his
head and his beard plucked out and his robe-collar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8161" id="noteref-8161" epub:type="noteref">8161</a> rent, and
sighting her son’s steed she shrieked, “Woe is me and well-away
for my child, ah!” and fainted swooning for a full-told hour.
Anon when recovered she said to the knights who had formed
the escort, “Woe to you, O men of evil, where have ye buried my
boy?” They replied, “In a far-off land whose name we wot not,
and ’tis wholly waste and tenanted by wild beasts,” whereat she
was afflicted exceedingly. Then the Emir Salamah and his wife
and household and all the tribesmen donned garbs black-hued and
ashes whereupon to sit they strewed, and ungrateful to them was
the taste of food and drink, meat and wine; nor ceased they to
beweep their loss, nor could they comprehend what had befallen
their son and what of ill-lot had descended upon him from Heaven.
Such then was the case of them; but as regards the Sultan Habib,
he continued sleeping until the Bhang ceased to work in his brain,
when Allah sent a fresh, cool wind which entered his nostrils and
caused him sneeze, whereby he cast out the drug and sensed the
sun-heat and came to himself. Hereupon he opened his eyes and
sighted a wild and waste land, and he looked in vain for his companions
the knights, and his steed and his sword and his spear and
his coat of mail, and he found himself mother-naked, athirst, an-hungered.
Then he cried out in that Desert of desolation which
lay far and wide before his eyes, and the case waxed heavy upon
him, and he wept and groaned and complained of his case to Allah
Almighty, saying, “O my God and my Lord and my Master, trace
my lot an thou hast traced it upon the Guarded Tablet, for who
shall right me save Thyself, O Lord of Might that is All-might
and of Grandeur All-puissant and All-excellent!” Then he began
improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Faileth me, O my God, the patience with the pride o’ me; ✿ Life-tie is broke and drawing nigh I see Death-tide o’ me:</div>
      <div class="line">To whom shall injured man complain of injury and wrong ✿ Save to the Lord (of Lords the Best!) who stands by side o’ me.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now whilst the Sultan Habib was ranging with his eye-corners to
the right and to the left behold, he beheld a blackness rising high
in air, and quoth he to himself, “Doubtless this dark object must
be a mighty city or a vast encampment, and I will hie me thither
before I be overheated by the sun-glow and I lose the power of
walking and I die of distress and none shall know my fate.” Then
he heartened his heart for the improvising of such poetry as came
to his mind, and he repeated these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Travel, for on the way all goodly things shalt find; ✿ And wake from sleep and dreams if still to sleep inclined!</div>
      <div class="line">Or victory win and rise and raise thee highmost high ✿ And gain, O giddy pate, the good for which thy soul hath pined;</div>
      <div class="line">Or into sorrow thou shalt fall with breast full strait ✿ And ne’er enjoy the Fame that wooes the gen’rous mind,</div>
      <div class="line">Nor is there any shall avail to hinder Fate ✿ Except the Lord of Worlds who the Two Beings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8162" id="noteref-8162" epub:type="noteref">8162</a> designed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he had finished his verse, the Sultan Habib walked in
the direction of that blackness nor left walking until he drew
near the ridge; but after he could fare no farther and that
walking distressed him (he never having been broken to travel
afoot and barefoot withal), and his forces waxed feeble and his
joints relaxed and his strong will grew weak and his resolution
passed away. But whilst he was perplexed concerning what he
should do, suddenly there alighted between his hands a snow-white
fowl huge as the dome of a Hammám, with shanks like the trunk
of a palm-tree. The Sultan Habib marvelled at the sight of this
Rukh and saying to himself, “Blessed be Allah the Creator!” he
advanced slowly towards it and all unknown to the fowl seized its
legs. Presently the bird put forth its wings (he still hanging on)
and flew upwards to the confines of the sky, when behold, a Voice
was heard saying, “O Habib! O Habib! hold to the bird with
straitest hold, else ’twill cast thee down to earth and thou shalt
be dashed to pieces limb from limb!” Hearing these words he
tightened his grasp and the fowl ceased not flying until it came to
that blackness which was the outline of Káf the mighty mountain,
and having set the youth down on the summit it left him and
still flew onwards. Presently a Voice sounded in the sensorium of
the Sultan Habib saying, “Take seat, O Habib; past is that which
conveyed thee hither on thy way to Durrat al-Ghawwas;” and he,
when the words met his ear, aroused himself and arose and, descending
the mountain slope to the skirting plain, saw therein a cave.
Hereat quoth he to himself, “If I enter this antre, haply shall I lose
myself, and perish of hunger and thirst!” He then took thought
and reflected, “Now death must come sooner or later, wherefore
will I adventure myself in this cave.” And as he passed thereinto
he heard one crying with a high voice and a sound so mighty
that its volume resounded in his ears. But right soon the crier
appeared in the shape of Al-Abbus, the Governor who had taught
him battle and combat; and, after greeting him with great joy,
the lover recounted his love-adventure to his whilome tutor. The
Jinni bore in his left a scymitar, the work of the Jann and in his
right a cup of water which he handed to his pupil. The draught
caused him to swoon for an hour or so, and when he came to Al-Abbus
made him sit up and bathed him and robed him in the
rarest of raiment and brought him a somewhat of victual and the
twain ate and drank together. Then quoth Habib to Al-Abbus
“Knowest thou not that which befel me with Durrat al-Ghawwas
of wondrous matters?” and quoth the other, “And what may
that have been?” whereupon the youth rejoined, “O my brother,
Allah be satisfied with thee for that He willed thou appear to me
and direct me and guide me aright to the dearling of my heart
and the cooling of mine eyes.” “Leave thou such foolish talk,”
replied Al-Abbus, “for where art thou and where is Durrat al-Ghawwas?
Indeed between thee and her are horrors and perils
and long tracts of land and seas wondrous, and adventures marvellous,
which would amaze and amate the rending lions, and
spectacles which would turn grey the sucking child or any one of
man’s scions.” Hearing these words Habib clasped his governor
to his breast and kissed him between the eyes, and the Jinni said,
“O my beloved, had I the might to unite thee with her I would do
on such wise, but first ’tis my desire to make thee forgather with
thy family in a moment shorter than an eye-twinkling.” “Had I
longed for my own people,” rejoined Habib, “I should never have
left them, nor should I have endangered my days nor wouldst
thou have seen me in this stead; but as it is I will never return
from my wayfaring till such time as my hope shall have been
fulfilled, even although my appointed life-term should be brought
to end, for I have no further need of existence.” To these words
the Jinni made answer, “Learn thou, O Habib, that the cavern
wherein thou art containeth the hoards of our Lord Solomon,
David’s son (upon the twain be The Peace!) and he placed them
under my charge and he forbade me abandon them until such time
as he shall permit me, and furthermore that I let and hinder both
mankind and Jinn-kind from entering the Hoard; and know thou,
O Habib, that in this cavern is a treasure-house and in the Treasury
forty closets offsetting to the right and to the left. Now wouldst
thou gaze upon this wealth of pearls and rubies and precious stones,
do thou ere passing through the first door dig under its threshold,
where thou shalt find buried the keys of all the magazines. Then
take the first of them in hand and unlock its door, after which
thou shalt be able to open all the others and look upon the store
of jewels therein. And when thou shalt design to depart the
Treasury thou shalt find a curtain hung up in front of thee and
fastened around it eighty hooks of red gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8163" id="noteref-8163" epub:type="noteref">8163</a> and do thou beware
how thou raise the hanging without quilting them all with cotton.”
So saying he gave him a bundle of tree-wool he had by him, and
pursued, “O Habib, when thou shalt have raised the curtain thou
wilt discover a door with two leaves also of red gold, whereupon
couplets are inscribed, and as regards the first distich an thou
master the meaning of the names and the talismans, thou shalt be
saved from all terrors and horrors, and if thou fail to comprehend
them thou shalt perish in that Hoard. But after opening the door
close it not with noise nor glance behind thee, and take all heed,
as I fear for thee those charged with the care of the place<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8164" id="noteref-8164" epub:type="noteref">8164</a> and its
tapestry. And when thou shalt stand behind the hanging thou
shalt behold a sea clashing with billows dashing, and ’tis one of
the Seven Mains which shall show thee, O Habib, marvels whereat
thou shalt wonder, and whereof relaters shall relate the strangest
relations. Then do thou take thy stand upon the sea-shore whence
thou shalt descry a ship under way and do thou cry aloud to the
crew who shall come to thee and bear thee aboard. After this I
wot not what shall befal thee in this ocean, and such is the end of my
say and the last of my speech, O Habib, and—The Peace!” Hereat
the youth joyed with joy galore than which naught could be
more and taking the hand of Al-Abbus he kissed it and said, “O
my brother, thou hast given kindly token in what thou hast spoken,
and Allah requite thee for me with all weal, and mayest thou be
fended from every injurious ill!” Quoth Al-Abbus, “O Habib, take
this scymitar and baldrick thyself therewith, indeed ’twill enforce
thee and hearten thy heart, and don this dress which shall defend
thee from thy foes.” The youth did as he was bidden; then he
farewelled the Jinni and set forth on his way, and he ceased not
pacing forward until he reached the end of the cavern and here he
came upon the door whereof his governor had informed him. So he
went to its threshold and dug thereunder and drew forth a black
bag creased and stained by the lapse of years. This he unclosed
and it yielded him a key which he applied to the lock and it
forthwith opened and admitted him into the Treasury where, for
exceeding murk and darkness, he could not see what he hent in
hand. Then quoth he to himself, “What is to do? Haply Al-Abbus
hath compassed my destruction!” And the while he sat
on this wise sunken in thought, behold, he beheld a light gleaming
from afar, and as he advanced its sheen guided him to the curtain
whereof he had been told by the Jinni. But as he looked he saw
above it a tablet of emerald dubbed with pearls and precious stones,
while under it lay the hoard which lighted up the place like the rising
sun. So he hastened him thither and found inscribed upon the
tablet the following two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“At him I wonder who from woe is free, ✿ And who no joy displays<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8165" id="noteref-8165" epub:type="noteref">8165</a> when safe is he:</div>
      <div class="line">And I admire how Time deludes man when ✿ He views the past; but ah Time’s tyranny.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="figcenter id001">
<img src="images/i_c256a.jpg" alt="" class="ig001" />
</div>

<p>So the Sultan Habib read over these verses more than once,
and wept till he swooned away; then recovering himself he said
in his mind, “To me death were pleasanter than life without my
love!” and turning to the closets which lay right and left he
opened them all and gazed upon the hillocks of gold and silver
and upon the heaps and bales of rubies and unions and precious
stones and strings of pearls, wondering at all he espied, and
quoth he to himself, “Were but a single magazine of these
treasures revealed, wealthy were all the peoples who on earth do
dwell.” Then he walked up to the curtain whereupon Jinns and
Ifrits appeared from every site and side, and voices and shrieks so
loudened in his ears that his wits well-nigh flew from his head.
So he took patience for a full-told hour when behold, a smoke
which spired in air thickened and brooded low, and the sound
ceased and the Jinns departed. Hereat, calling to mind the
charge of Al-Abbus, he took out the cotton he had by him and
after quilting the golden hooks he withdrew the curtain and
sighted the portal which the Jinni had described to him. So
he fitted in the key and opened it, after which, oblivious of the
warning, he slammed-to the door noisily in his fear and forgetfulness,
but he did not venture to look behind him. At this the
Jinns flocked to him from every side and site crying, “O thou
foulest of mankind, wherefore dost thou provoke us and disturb
us from our stead? and, but for thy wearing the gear of the
Jann, we had slain thee forthright.” But Habib answered not
and, arming himself with patience and piety, he tarried awhile
until the hubbub was stilled, nor did the Jann cry at him any
more: and, when the storm was followed by calm, he paced
forward to the shore and looked upon the ocean crashing with
billows dashing. He marvelled at the waves and said to himself,
“Verily none may know the secrets of the sea and the mysteries
of the main save only Allah!” Presently, he beheld a ship
passing along shore, so he took seat on the strand until Night
let down her pall of sables upon him; and he was an-hungered
with exceeding hunger and athirst with excessive thirst. But
when morrowed the morn and day showed her sheen and shone
serene, he awoke in his sore distress and behold, he saw two
Mermaidens of the daughters of the deep (and both were as
moons) issue forth hard by him. And ere long quoth one of the
twain, “Say me, wottest thou the mortal who sitteth yonder?”
“I know him not,” quoth the other, whereat her companion
resumed, “This be the Sultan Habib who cometh in search of
Durrat al-Ghawwas, our Queen and liege lady.” Hearing these
words the youth considered them straitly and marvelling at their
beauty and loveliness he presently rejoiced and increased in
pleasure and delight. Then said one to other, “Indeed the Sultan
Habib is in this matter somewhat scant and short of wits; how
can he love Durrat al-Ghawwas when between him and her is a
distance only to be covered by the sea-voyage of a full year over
most dangerous depths? And, after all this woe hath befallen
him, why doth he not hie him home and why not save himself
from these horrors which promise to endure through all his
days and to cast his life at last into the pit of destruction?”
Asked the other, “Would heaven I knew whether he will ever
attain to her or not!” and her companion answered, “Yes, he
will attain to her, but after a time and a long time and much
sadness of soul.” But when Habib heard this promise of success
given by the Maidens of the Main his sorrow was solaced and
he lost all that troubled him of hunger and thirst. Now while he
pondered these matters there suddenly issued from out the ocean
a third Mermaid, which asked her fellows, “Of what are you
prattling?” and they answered, “Indeed the Sultan Habib sitteth
here upon the sea-shore during this the fourth successive night.”
Quoth she, “I have a cousin the daughter of my paternal uncle
and when she came to visit me last night I enquired of her if any
ship had passed by her and she replied:—Yea verily, one did
sail driven towards us by a violent gale, and its sole object was
to seek you.” And the others rejoined, “Allah send thee tidings
of welfare!” The youth hearing these words was gladdened
and joyed with exceeding joy; and presently the three Mermaidens
called to one another and dove into the depths leaving the listener
standing upon the strand. After a short time he heard the cries
of the crew from the craft announced and he shouted to them
and they, noting his summons, ran alongside the shore and took
him up and bore him aboard: and, when he complained of
hunger and thirst, they gave him meat and drink and questioned
him saying, “Thou! who art thou? Say us, art of the traderfolk?”
“I am the merchant Such-and-such,” quoth he, “and
my ship foundered albe ’twas a mighty great vessel; but one
chance day of the days as we were sailing along there burst
upon us a furious gale which shivered our timbers and my companions
all perished while I floated upon a plank of the ship’s
planks and was carried ashore by the send of the sea. Indeed
I have been floating for three days and this be my fourth night.”
Hearing this adventure from him the traders cried, “Grieve no
more in heart but be thou of good cheer and of eyes cool and
clear: the sea voyage is ever exposed to such chances and so is
the gain thereby we obtain; and if Allah deign preserve us and
keep for us the livelihood He vouchsafed to us we will bestow
upon thee a portion thereof.” After this they ceased not sailing
until a tempest assailed them and blew their vessel to starboard
and larboard and she lost her course and went astray at sea.
Hereat the pilot cried aloud, saying, “Ho ye company aboard,
take your leave one of other for we be driven into unknown
depths of ocean, nor may we keep our course, because the wind
bloweth full in our faces.” Hereupon the voyagers fell to beweeping
the loss of their lives and their goods, and the Sultan
Habib shed tears which trickled adown his cheeks and exclaimed,
“Would Heaven I had died before seeing such torment: indeed
this is naught save a matter of marvel.” But when the merchants
saw the youth thus saddened and troubled of soul, and
weeping withal, they said to him, “O Monarch of the Merchants,
let not thy breast be straitened or thy heart be disheartened:
haply Allah shall vouchsafe joy to us and to thee: moreover, can
vain regret and sorrow of soul and shedding of tears avail aught?
Do thou rather ask of the Almighty that He deign relieve us and
further our voyage.” But as the vessel ran through the middle
of the main, she suddenly ceased her course and came to a stop
without tacking to the right or the left, and the pilot cried out,
“O folk, is there any of you who conneth this ocean?” But they
made answer, “We know thereof naught, neither in all our voyage
did we see aught resembling it.” The pilot continued, “O folk,
this main is hight ‘The Azure’;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8166" id="noteref-8166" epub:type="noteref">8166</a> nor did any trader at any time
therein enter but he found destruction; for that it is the home
of Jinns and the house of Ifrits, and he who now withholdeth our
vessel from its course is known as Al-Ghashamsham,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8167" id="noteref-8167" epub:type="noteref">8167</a> and our lord
Solomon son of David (upon the twain be The Peace!) deputed
him to snatch up and carry off from every craft passing through
these forbidden depths whatever human beings, and especially
merchants he might find a-voyaging, and to eat them alive.”
“Woe to thee!” cried Habib. “Wherefore bid us take counsel
together when thou tellest us that here dwelleth a Demon
over whom we have no power to prevail, and thou terrifiest us
with the thoughts of being devoured by him? However, feel ye
no affright; I will fend off from you the mischief of this Ifrit.”
They replied, “We fear for thy life, O Monarch of the Merchants,”
and he rejoined, “To you there is no danger.” Thereupon he
donned a closely woven mail-coat and armed himself with the
magical scymitar and spear; then, taking the skins of animals
freshly slain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8168" id="noteref-8168" epub:type="noteref">8168</a> he made a hood and vizor thereof and wrapped
strips of the same around his arms and legs that no harm from
the sea might enter his frame. After this he bade his shipmates
bind him with cords under his armpits and let him down amiddlemost
the main. And as soon as he touched bottom he was
confronted by the Ifrit, who rushed forward to make a mouthful
of him, when the Sultan Habib raised his forearm and with the
scymitar smote him a stroke which fell upon his neck and hewed
him into two halves. So he died in the depths; and the youth,
seeing the foeman slain, jerked the cord and his mates drew
him up and took him in, after which the ship sprang forward
like a shaft outshot from the belly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8169" id="noteref-8169" epub:type="noteref">8169</a> of the bow. Seeing this all
the traders wondered with excessive wonderment and hastened
up to the youth, kissing his feet and crying, “O Monarch of the
Merchants, how didst thou prevail against him and do him die?”
“When I dropped into the depths,” replied he, “in order to slay
him, I asked against him the aidance of Allah, who vouchsafed
His assistance, and on such wise I slaughtered him.” Hearing
these good tidings and being certified of their enemy’s death the
traders offered to him their good and gains whereof he refused to
accept aught, even a single mustard seed. Now, amongst the
number was a Shaykh well shotten in years and sagacious in all
affairs needing direction; and this oldster drew near the youth, and
making lowly obeisance said to him, “By the right of Who sent
thee uswards and sent us theewards, what art thou and what
may be thy name and the cause of thy falling upon this ocean?”
The Sultan Habib began by refusing to disclose aught of his
errand, but when the Shaykh persisted in questioning he ended by
disclosing all that had betided him first and last, and as they sailed
on suddenly the Pilot cried out to them, “Rejoice ye with great
joy and make ye merry and be ye gladdened with good news,
O ye folk, for that ye are saved from the dangers of these terrible
depths and ye are drawing near the city of Sábúr, the King who
overruleth the Isles Crystalline; and his capital (which be
populous and prosperous) ranketh first among the cities of Al-Hind,
and his reign is foremost of the Isles of the Sea.” Then the ship
inclined thither, and drawing nearer little by little entered the
harbour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8170" id="noteref-8170" epub:type="noteref">8170</a> and cast anchor therein, when the canoes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8171" id="noteref-8171" epub:type="noteref">8171</a> appeared and
the porters came on board and bore away the luggage of the
voyagers and the crew, who were freed from all sorrow and anxiety.
Such was their case; but as regards Durrat al-Ghawwas, when she
parted from her lover, the Sultan Habib, severance weighed sore
and stark upon her, and she found no pleasure in meat and drink
and slumber and sleep. And presently whilst in this condition
and sitting upon her throne of estate, an Ifrit appeared to her and
coming forwards between her hands said, “The Peace of Allah
be upon thee, O Queen of the Age and Empress of the Time and
the Tide!” whereto she made reply, “And upon thee be The Peace
and the ruth of Allah and His blessings. What seekest thou
O Ifrit?” Quoth he, “There lately hath come to us a shipful of
merchants and I have heard talk of the Sultan Habib being
amongst them.” As these words reached her ear she largessed the
Ifrit and said to him, “An thou speak sooth I will bestow upon
thee whatso thou wishest.” Then, having certified herself of the
news, she bade decorate the city with the finest of decorations and
let beat the kettledrums of glad tidings and bespread the way
leading to the Palace with a carpeting of sendal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8172" id="noteref-8172" epub:type="noteref">8172</a> and they obeyed
her behest. Anon she summoned her pages and commanded them
to bring her lover before her; so they repaired to him and ordered
him to accompany them. Accordingly, he followed them and they
ceased not faring until they had escorted him to the Palace, when
the Queen bade all her pages gang their gait and none remained
therein save the two lovers; to wit, the Sultan Habib and Durrat
al-Ghawwas. And after the goodly reunion she sent for the Kazi
and his assessors and bade them write out her marriage-writ<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8173" id="noteref-8173" epub:type="noteref">8173</a> with
Habib. He did as he was bidden and the witnesses bore testimony
thereto and to the dowry being duly paid; and the tie was formally
tied and the wedding banquets were dispread. Then the bride
donned her choicest of dresses and the marriage procession was
formed and the union was consummated and both joyed with joy
exceeding. Now this state of things endured for a long while until
the Sultan Habib fell to longing after his parents and his family
and his native country; and at length, on a day of the days, when
a banquet was served up to him by his bride he refused to taste
thereof, and she, noting and understanding his condition, said to
him, “Be of good cheer, this very night thou shalt find thee amongst
thine own folk.” Accordingly she summoned her Wazir of the
Jann, and when he came she made proclamation amongst the
nobles and commons of the capital saying, “This my Wazir shall
be my Viceregent over you and whoso shall gainsay him that man
I will slay.” They replied with “Hearkening to and obeying
Allah and thyself and the Minister.” Then turning to her newly-established
deputy she said, “I desire that thou guide me to the
garden wherein was the Sultan Habib;” and he replied, “Upon my
head be it and on my eyes!” So an Ifrit was summoned, and
Habib mounting him pick-a-back together with the Princess Durrat
al-Ghawwas bade him repair to the garden appointed, and the
Jinni took flight, and in less than the twinkling of an eye bore the
couple to their destination. Such was the reunion of the Sultan
Habib with Durrat al-Ghawwas and his joyous conjunction;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8174" id="noteref-8174" epub:type="noteref">8174</a> but
as regards the Emir Salamah and his wife, as they were sitting and
recalling to memory their only child and wondering in converse
at what fate might have betided him, lo and behold! the Sultan
Habib stood before them and by his side was Durrat al-Ghawwas
his bride, and as they looked upon him and her, weeping prevailed
over them for excess of their joyance and delight and both his
parents threw themselves upon him and fell fainting to the ground.
As soon as they recovered the youth told them all that had betided
him, first and last, whereupon one congratulated other and the
kettledrums of glad tidings were sounded, and a world of folk
from all the Badawi tribes and the burghers gathered about them
and offered hearty compliments on the reunion of each with other.
Then the encampment was decorated in whole and in part, and
festivities were appointed for a term of seven days full-told, in
token of joy and gladness; and banquets were arrayed and trays
were dispread, and all sat down to them in the pleasantest of life
eating and drinking; and the hungry were filled, and the mean
and the miserable and the mendicants were feasted until the end
of the seventh day. After this they applied them to the punishment
of the ten Knights whom the Emir Salamah had despatched
to escort his son; and the Sultan Habib gave order that retribution
be required from them, and restitution of all the coin and the
good and the horses and the camels entrusted to them by his sire.
When these had been recovered he commanded that there be set
up for them as many stakes in the garden wherein he sat with his
bride, and there in their presence he let impale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8175" id="noteref-8175" epub:type="noteref">8175</a> each upon his
own pale. And thenceforward the united household ceased not
living the most joyous of lives and the most delectable until the
old Emir Salamah paid the debt of nature, and they mourned him
with excessive mourning for seven days. When these were ended
his son, the Sultan Habib, became ruler in his stead and received
the homage of all the tribes and clans who came before him and
prayed for his victory and his length of life; and the necks of his
subjects, even the most stubborn, were bowed in abasement before
him. On this wise he reigned over the Crystalline Isles of Sabur,
his sire-in-law, with justice and equity, and his Queen,
Durrat al-Ghawwas, bare to him children in numbers
who in due time followed in their father’s steps.
And here is terminated the tale of Sultan
Habib and Durrat al-Ghawwas with all
perfection and completion
and good omen.</p>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>NOTE ON THE HISTORY OF HABIB.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">The older translators of this “New Arabian Night” have made wild work
with this Novel at least as the original is given by my text and the edition
of Gauttier (vii. 60–90): in their desire to gallicise it they have invested it with
a toilette purely European and in the worst possible style. Amongst the insipid
details are the division of the Crystalline Islands into the White, Yellow,
Green and Blue; with the Genies Abarikaff, the monstrous Racachik,
Ilbaccaras and Mokilras; and the terrible journey of Habib to Mount Kaf with
his absurd reflections: even the “Roc” cannot come to his aid without “a
damask cushion suspended between its feet by silken cords” for the greater
comfort of the “Arabian Knight.” The Treasury of Solomon, “who fixed the
principles of knowledge by 366 hieroglyphics (<i><span xml:lang="la">sic</span></i>) each of which required a
day’s application from even the ablest understanding, before its mysterious
sense could be understood,” is spun out as if the episode were copy intended for
the daily press. In my text the “Maidens of the Main” are introduced to say
a few words and speed the action. In the French version Ilzaide the elder
becomes a “leading lady,” whose rôle is that of the naïve <i><span xml:lang="fr">ingénue</span></i>, famous for
“smartness” and “vivacity:” “one cannot refrain from smiling at the lively
sallies of her good nature and simplicity of heart.” I find this young person
the model of a pert, pretty, prattling little French <i><span xml:lang="fr">soubrette</span></i> who, moreover,
makes open love to “the master.” Habib calls the “good old lady,” his
governess “Esek! Esek!” which in Turk. means donkey, ass. I need hardly
enlarge upon these ineptitudes; those who wish to pursue the subject have
only to compare the two versions.</p>

<p>At the end of the Frenchified tale we find a note entitled:—“Observations by
the French Editor, on the History of Habib and Dorathil-goase, or the Arabian
Knight,” and these are founded not upon the Oriental text but upon the Occidental
perversion. It is described “from a moral plane rather as a poem than
a simple tale,” and it must be regarded as “a Romance of Chivalry which unites
the two chief characteristics of works of that sort,—amusement and instruction.”
Habib’s education is compared with that of Telemachus, and his being
inured to fatigue is according to the advice of Rousseau “in his Emilius” and
the practice of Robinson Crusoe. Lastly “Grandison is a hero already formed:
Habib is one who needs to be instructed.” I cannot but suspect when reading
all this Western travesty of an Eastern work that M. Cazotte, a typical
<i><span xml:lang="fr">littérateur</span></i>, had prepared for caricaturing the unfortunate Habib by carefully
writing up Fénélon, Rousseau, and Richardson; and had grafted his own ideas
of <i><span xml:lang="fr">morale</span></i> upon the wild stem of the Arabian novel.</p>
