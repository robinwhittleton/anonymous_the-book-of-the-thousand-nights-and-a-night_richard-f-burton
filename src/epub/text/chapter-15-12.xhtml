			<h2 epub:type="title">The Lady with Two Coyntes</h2>

<p>It is told of a woman which was a fornicatress and adulteress and
a companion of catastrophes and calamities that she was married
to a Káim-makám<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7486" id="noteref-7486" epub:type="noteref">7486</a> who had none of the will of mankind to
womankind, at all, at all. Now the wife was possessed of beauty
and loveliness and she misliked him for that he had no desire to
carnal copulation, and there was in the house a Syce-man who was
dying for his love of her. But her husband would never quit his
quarters, and albeit her longing was that the horse-keeper might
possess her person and that she and he might lie together, this
was impossible to her. She abode perplext for some sleight
wherewith she might serve her mate, and presently she devised a
device and said to him, “O my lord, verily my mother is dead
and ’tis my wish to hie me and be present at her burial and
receive visits of condolence for her; and, if she have left aught
by way of heritage, to take it and then fare back to thee.” “Thou
mayest go,” said he, and said she, “I dread to fare abroad alone and
unattended; nor am I able to walk, my parent’s house being afar.
Do thou cry out to the Syce that he fetch me hither an ass and
accompany me to the house of my mother, wherein I shall lie some
three nights after the fashion of folk.” Hereupon he called to the
horse-keeper and when he came before him, ordered the man to
bring an ass<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7487" id="noteref-7487" epub:type="noteref">7487</a> and mount his mistress and hie with her; and the
fellow, hearing these words, was hugely delighted. So he did as
he was bidden, but instead of going to the house they twain, he
and she, repaired to a garden carrying with them a flask of wine
and disappeared for the whole day and made merry and took their
pleasure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7488" id="noteref-7488" epub:type="noteref">7488</a> until set of sun. Then the man brought up the ass
and mounting her thereon went to his own home, where the twain
passed the entire night sleeping in mutual embrace on each other’s
bosoms, and took their joyance and enjoyment until it was
morning tide. Hereupon he arose and did with her as before,
leading her to the garden, and the two, Syce and dame, ceased
not to be after this fashion for three days solacing themselves and
making merry and tasting of love-liesse. On the fourth day
he said to her, “Do thou return with us to the house of the
Kaim-makam,” and said she, “No; not till we shall have spent
together three days more enjoying ourselves, I and thou, and
making merry till such time as I have had my full will of thee
and thou thy full will of me; and leave we yon preposterous pimp
to lie stretched out, as do the dogs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7489" id="noteref-7489" epub:type="noteref">7489</a> enfolding his head between his
two legs.” So the twain ceased not amusing themselves and taking
their joyance and enjoyment until they had ended the six days,
and on the seventh they wended their way home. They found the
Kaim-makam sitting beside a slave which was an old negress;
and quoth he, “You have disappeared for a long while!” and
quoth she, “Yes, until we had ended with the visits of condolence
for that my mother was known to foyson of the folk. But, O my
lord, my parent (Allah have ruth upon her!) hath left and
bequeathed to me a somewhat exceeding nice.” “What may
that be?” asked he, and answered she, “I will not tell thee aught
thereof at this time, nor indeed until we remain, I and thou, in
privacy of night, when I will describe it unto thee.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Fifty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
woman said to her husband, “My mother hath left and bequeathed
to me somewhat, but I will not tell thee thereof till the
coming night when we twain shall be alone.” “’Tis well,” said he;
after which he continued to address himself, “Would Heaven I
knew what hath been left by the mother of our Harím!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7490" id="noteref-7490" epub:type="noteref">7490</a> Now
when darkness came on and he and she had taken seats together,
he asked her, “What may be the legacy thy mother left?” and she
answered, “O my lord, my mother hath bequeathed to me her
Coynte being loath that it be given to other save myself and therefore
I have brought it along with me.” Quoth he of his stupidity
(for he was like unto a cosset),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7491" id="noteref-7491" epub:type="noteref">7491</a> “Ho thou, solace me with the sight
of thy mother’s Coynte.” Hereupon she arose; and, doffing all she
had on her of dress until she was mother-naked, said to him, “O my
lord, I have stuck on my mother’s Coynte hard by and in continuation
of mine own cleft and so the twain of them have
remained each adjoining other between my hips.” He continued,
“Let me see it;” so she stood up before him and pointing to her
parts, said, “This which faceth thee is my coynte whereof thou
art owner;” after which she raised her backside and bowing her
head groundwards showed the nether end of her slit between the
two swelling cheeks of her sit-upon, her seat of honour, crying,
“Look thou! this be the Coynte of my mother; but, O my lord,
’tis my wish that we wed it unto some good man and pleasant
who is faithful and true and not likely treason to do, for that the
coynte of my mother must abide by me and whoso shall intermarry
therewith I also must bow down to him whilst he shall
have his will thereof.” Quoth the Kaim-makam, “O sensible say!
but we must seek and find for ourselves a man who shall be agreeable
and trustworthy,” presently adding, “O woman, we will not
give the Coynte of thy mother in marriage to some stranger lest
he trouble thee and trouble me also; so let us bestow this boon
upon our own Syce.” Replied the wife of her craft and cursedness,
“Haply, O my lord, the horsekeeper will befit us not;” yet
the while she had set her heart upon him. Rejoined the Kaim-makam
her husband, “If so it be that he have shown thee want
of respect we will surely relieve him of his lot.” But after so
speaking he said a second time, “’Tis better that we give the Coynte
of thy mother to the Syce;” and she retorted, “Well and good!
but do thou oblige him that he keep strait watch upon himself.”
Hereat the man summoned his servant before him and
said to him, “Hear me, O Syce; verily the mother of my wife
to her hath bequeathed her Coynte, and ’tis our intent to bestow it
upon thee in lawful wedlock; yet beware lest thou draw near that
which is our own property.” The horsekeeper answered, “No, O
my lord, I never will.” Now after they arrived at that agreement
concerning the matter in question, whenever the wife waxed
hot with heat of lust she would send for the Syce and take him
and repair with him, he and she, to a place of privacy within the
Harem, whilst her mate remained sitting thoroughly satisfied,
and they would enjoy themselves to the uttermost, after which the
twain would come forth together. And the Kaim-makam never
ceased saying on such occasions, “Beware, O Syce, lest thou
poach upon that which is my property;” and at such times the
wife would exclaim, “By Allah, O my lord, he is a true man and
a trusty.” So they continued for a while<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7492" id="noteref-7492" epub:type="noteref">7492</a> in the enjoyment of
their luxury and this was equally pleasurable to the husband and
wife and the lover. Now when the Emir heard this tale from the
Butcher, he began laughing until he fell upon his back and anon
he said to him, “Wend thy ways about thine own work;” so the
Flesher went forth from him not knowing what he should do in
his garb of gaberdine and bonnet. Hereupon the woman arose
and going to the fourth closet threw it open and summoned and
led the Trader man by the hand and set him before her husband
who looked hard at him in his droll’s dress and recognised him
and was certified of him that he was his neighbour. So he said,
“Ho Such-an-one! Thou art our neighbour and never did we
suspect that thou wouldst strive to seduce our Harím;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7493" id="noteref-7493" epub:type="noteref">7493</a> nay rather
did we expect thee to keep watch and ward over us and fend off
from us all evil.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7494" id="noteref-7494" epub:type="noteref">7494</a> Now by Allah, those whom we have dismissed
wrought us no foul wrong even as thou wroughtest us in this
affair; for thou at all events art our neighbour. Thou deservest
in this matter that I slay thee out of hand, but Default cometh not
save from the Defaulter; therefore I will do thee no harm at all
as did I with thy fellows even save that needs must thou tell us a
tale whereby to rejoice us.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7495" id="noteref-7495" epub:type="noteref">7495</a> Quoth he, “Hearing and obeying,”
and herewith fell to relating the story of</p>
