<p class="c000">I take the liberty of placing your names at the head of this Volume which owes
its rarest and raciest passages to your kindly refusing the temporary transfer of the
Wortley Montague MS. from your pleasant library to the care of Dr. Rost, Chief
Librarian, India Office. As a sop to “bigotry and virtue,” as a concession to the
“Scribes and Pharisees,” I had undertaken, in case the loan were granted, not to translate
tales and passages which might expose you, the Curators, to unfriendly comment. But,
possibly anticipating what injury would thereby accrue to the Volume and what sorrow
to my subscribers, you were good enough not to sanction the transfer—indeed you refused
it to me twice—and for this step my <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">clientèle</span></i> will be (or ought to be) truly thankful to
you.</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE TRANSLATOR’S FOREWORD</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010">This volume contains the last of my versions from the Wortley
Montague Codex, and this is the place to offer a short account
of that much bewritten MS.</p>

<p class="c000">In the “Annals of the Bodleian Library,” etc., by the Reverend
William Dunn Macray, M.A. (London, Oxford and Cambridge,
1868: 8vo. p. 206), we find the following official notice:—</p>

<p class="c011">“A.D. 1803.”</p>

<p class="c011">“An Arabic MS. in seven volumes, written in 1764–5, and containing
what is rarely met with, a complete collection of the
Thousand and one Tales (N.B. an error for “Nights”) of
the <em>Arabian Nights Entertainments</em>, was bought from Captain
Jonathan Scott for £50. Mr. Scott published, in 1811, an edition
of the Tales in six volumes (N.B. He reprinted the wretched
English version of Prof. Galland’s admirable French, and his
“revisions” and “occasional corrections” are purely imaginative,)
in which this MS. is described, (N.B. after the mos majorum).
He obtained it from Dr. (Joseph) White, the Professor of Hebrew
and Arabic at Oxford, who had bought it at the sale of the library
of Edward Wortley Montague, by whom it had been brought from
the East. (N.B. Dr. White at one time intended to translate it
literally, and thereby eclipse the Anglo-French version.) It is
<span class="pageno" id="Page_x">x</span>noticed in Ouseley’s Oriental Collections (Cadell and Davies),
vol. ii. p. 25.”</p>

<p class="c000">The Jonathan Scott above alluded to appears under various
titles as Mr. Scott, Captain Scott and Doctor Scott. He was an
officer in the Bengal Army about the end of the last century, and
was made Persian Secretary by “Warren Hastings, Esq.,” to
whom he dedicated his “Tales, Anecdotes and Letters, translated
from the Arabic and Persian” (Cadell and Davies, London,
1800), and he englished the “Bahár-i-Dánish” (A.D. 1799) and
“Firishtah’s History of the Dakkhan (Deccan) and of the reigns
of the later Emperors of Hindostan.” He became Dr. Scott
because made an LL.D. at Oxford as meet for a “Professor (of
Oriental languages) at the Royal Military and East India
Colleges”; and finally he settled at Netley, in Shropshire, where
he died.</p>

<p class="c000">It is not the fault of English Orientalists if the MS. in question
is not thoroughly well-known to the world of letters. In 1797
Sir Gore Ouseley’s “Oriental Collections” (vol. ii. pp. 25–33)
describes it, evidently with the aid of Scott, who is the authority
for stating that the tales generally appear like pearls strung at
random on the same thread; adding, “if they are truly Oriental
it is a matter of little importance to us Europeans whether they
are strung on this night or that night.”<a id="r1"></a><a href="#f1" class="c012"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This first and somewhat
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xi">xi</span>imperfect catalogue of the contents was followed in 1811 by a
second, which concludes the six-volume edition of “The</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">The sixth volume, whose second title is “Tales | selected
from the Manuscript copy | of the | 1001 Nights | brought to
Europe by Edward Wortley Montague, Esq.,” ends with a general
Appendix, of which ten pages are devoted to a description of the
Codex and a Catalogue of its contents. Scott’s sixth volume,
like the rest of his version, is now becoming rare, and it is
regretable that when Messieurs Nimmo and Bain reprinted,
in 1882, the bulk of the work (4 vols. 8vo) they stopped short
at volume five.</p>

<p class="c000">Lastly we find a third list dating from 1835 in the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catalogi
| Codicum Manuscriptorum Orientalium | Bibliothecæ Bodleianæ

Arabici Mahommedani Narrationes Fictæ sive Historiæ Romanenses
| in Quarto</span>” (pp. 145–150).</p>

<p class="c000">I am not aware that any attempt has been made to trace the
history of the Wortley Montague MS.; but its internal evidence
supplies a modicum of information.</p>

<p class="c000">By way of colophon to the seventh and last volume we have,
“On this wise end to us the Stories of the Kings and histories of
various folk as foregoing in the Thousand Nights and a Night,
perfected and completed, on the eighteenth day of Safar the
auspicious, which is of the months of (the year A. H.) one thousand
one hundred and seventy-eight” (= A.D. 1764–65).</p>

<p class="c000">“Copied by the humblest and neediest of the poor, Omar-al-Safatí,
to whose sins may Allah be Ruthful!</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“An thou find in us fault deign default supply,</div>
      <div class="line">And hallow the Faultless and Glorify.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The term “Suftah” is now and has been applied for the last
century to the sons of Turkish fathers by Arab mothers, and many
of these Mulattos live by the pen. On the fly-leaf of vol. i. is
written in a fine and flowing Persian (?) hand, strongly contrasting
with the text of the tome, which is unusually careless and bad,
“This Book | The Thousand Nights and a Night of the Acts and
deeds (Sírat) of the Kings | and what befel them from sundry |
women that were whorish | and witty | and various | Tales |
therein.” Below it also is a Persian couplet written in vulgar
Iranian characters of the half-Shikastah type:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Chih goyam, o chih poyam? ✿ Na mí-dánam hích o púch.</div>
      <div class="line">(What shall I say or whither fly? ✿ This stuff and this nonsense know not I.)</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Moreover, at the beginning of vol. i. is a list of fifteen tales
written in Europeo-Arabic characters, after schoolboy fashion,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>and probably by Scott. In vol. ii. there is no initial list, but by
way of Foreword we read, “This is volume the second of the
Thousand Nights and a Night from the xciii<sup>d.</sup> Night, full and
complete.” And the Colophon declares, “And this is what hath
been finished for us of the fourth (probably a clerical error for
“second”) tome of the Thousand Nights and a Night to the
clxxvii<sup>th.</sup> Night, written on the twentieth day of the month
Sha’bán A.H., one thousand one hundred and seventy-seven”
(= A.D. 1764). This date shows that the MS. was finished during
the year after incept.</p>

<p class="c000">The text from which our MS. was copied must have been
valuable, and we have reason to regret that so many passages
both of poetry and prose are almost hopelessly corrupt. Its
tone and tenor are distinctly Nilotic; and, as Mr. E. Wortley
Montague lived for some time in Egypt, he may have bought it at
the Capital of the Nile-land. The story of the Syrian (v. 468) and
that of the Two Lack-tacts (vi. 262), notably exalt Misr and Cairo
at the expense of Shám and Damascus; and there are many other
instances of preferring Kemi the Black Soil to the so-called “Holy
Land.” The general tone, as well as the special incidents of the book,
argues that the stories may have been ancient, but they certainly
have been modernised. Coffee is commonly used (passim)
although tobacco is still unknown; a youth learns archery and
gunnery (Zarb al-Risás, vol. vii. 440); casting of cannon occurs
(vol. v. 186), and in one place (vol. vi. 134) we read of “Tabanjatayn,”
a pair of pistols; the word, which is still popular, being a
corruption of the Persian “Tabáncheh” = a slap or blow, even as
the French call a derringer <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">coup de poing</span></i>. The characteristic of
this Recueil is its want of finish. The stories are told after perfunctory
fashion as though the writer had not taken the trouble to
work out the details. There are no names or titles to the tales,
so that every translator must give his own; and the endings are
equally unsatisfactory, they usually content themselves, after
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>“native” fashion, with “Intihá” = finis; and the connection with
the thread of the work must be supplied by the story-teller or the
translator. Headlines were not in use for the MSS. of that day,
and the catchwords are often irregular, a new word taking the
place of the initial in the following page.</p>

<p class="c000">The handwriting, save and except in the first volume, has the
merit of regularity, and appears the same throughout the succeeding
six, except in the rare places (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> vi. 92–93), where the lazy
copyist did not care to change a worn-out pen, and continued to
write with a double nib. On the other hand, it is the character of
a village-schoolmaster whose literary culture is at its lowest.
Hardly a sheet appears without some blunder which only in rare
places is erased or corrected, and a few lacunæ are supplied by
several hands, Oriental and European, the latter presumably
Scott’s. Not unfrequently the terminal word of a line is divided,
a sign of great incuria or ignorance, as “Sháhr | baz” (i. 4),
“Shahr | zád” (v. 309, vi. 106), and “Fawa | jadtu-h” = so I found
him (v. 104). Koranic quotations almost always lack vowel-points,
and are introduced without the usual ceremony. Poetry
also, that crux of a skilful scribe, is carelessly treated, and often
enough two sets of verse are thrown into one, the first rhyming in
úr, and the second in ír (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> vol. v. 256). The rhyme-words also
are repeated within unlawful limits (passim and vol. v. 308, ll. 6
and 11). Verse is thrust into the body of the page (vii. 112)
without signs of citation in red ink or other (iii. 406); and rarely
we find it, as it should be, in distichs divided by the normal
conventional marks, asterisks and similar separations. Sometimes
it appears in a column of hemistichs after the fashion of Europe
(iv. 111; iv. 232, etc.): here (v. 226) a quotation is huddled into
a single line; there (v. 242) four lines, written as monostichs, are
followed by two distichs in as many lines.</p>

<p class="c000">As regards the metrical part Dr. Steingass writes to me, “The
verses in Al-Hayfá and Yúsuf, where not mere doggerel, are spoiled
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xv">xv</span>by the spelling. I was rarely able to make out even the metre
and I think you have accomplished a feat by translating them as
you have done.”</p>

<p class="c000">The language of the MS. is generally that of the Felláh and
notably so in sundry of the tales, such as, “The Goodwife of
Cairo and her four Gallants” (v. 444). Of this a few verbal and
phrasal instances will suffice. Adíní = here am I (v. 198);
Ahná (passim, for nahnu) nakháf = we fear; ’Alaykí (for ’alaykĭ)
= on thee; and generally the long vowel (-kí) for the short (-ki)
in the pronoun of the second person feminine; Antah (for anta)
= thou (vi. 96) and Antú (for antum) = you (iii. 351); Aráha
and even arúha, rúhat and rúha (for ráha) = he went (vii. 74
and iv. 75) and Arúhú (for rúhú) = go ye (iv. 179); Bakarah * * * allazi (for allatí) = a cow (he) who, etc.; (see in this
vol., p. 253) and generally a fine and utter contempt for genders,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Hum (for hunna) masc. for fem. (iii. 91; iii. 146; and v. 233);
Tá’áli (for ta’ál) fem. for masc. (vi. 96 et passim); Bíhím (for
bi-him) = with them (v. 367); Bi-kám (for bi-kum) = with you
(iii. 142) are fair specimens of long broad vowels supplanting the
short, a peculiarity known in classical Arab., <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Miftáh (for
Miftah) = a key. Here, however, it is exaggerated, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Bá’íd (for
ba’íd) = far (iv. 167); Kám (for kam) = how many? Kúm (for
kum) = you (v. 118); Kúl-há (for kul-há) = tell it (iv. 58); Mín
(for man) = who? (iii. 89); Mirwád (for Mirwad) = a branding iron;
Natanáshshad (for natanashshad) = we seek tidings (v. 211);
Rájal (pron. Rágil, for Rajul) = a man (iv. 118 and passim); Sáhal
(for sahal) = easy, facile (iv. 71); Sír (for sir) = go, be off!
(v. 199); Shíl (for shil) = carry away (i. 111); and Záhab (for
zahab) = gold (v. 186). This broad Doric or Caledonian articulation
is not musical to unaccustomed organs. As in popular
parlance the Dál supplants the Zál; <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Dahaba (for zahaba) =
he went (v. 277 and passim); also T takes the place of Th, as
Tult for thulth = one third (iii. 348) and Tamrat (for thamrat) =
<span class="pageno" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>fruit (v. 260), thus generally ignoring the sibilant Th after the
fashion of the modern Egyptians who say Tumm (for thumma)
= again; “Kattir (for kaththir) Khayrak” = God increase thy
weal, and Lattama (for laththama) = he veiled. Also a general
ignoring of the dual, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Házá ’usfurayn (for ’Usfuráni) = these be
birds (vi. 121); Nazalú al-Wazirayn (do) = the two Wazirs went
down (vii. 123); and lastly Al-Wuzará al-itnayn (for Al-Wazíráni)
= the two Wazirs (vii. 121). Again a fine contempt for numbers, as
Nanzur ana (for Anzur) = I (we) see (v. 198) and Inní (for inná)
narúhu = indeed I (we) go (iii. 190). Also an equally conscientious
disregard for cases, as Min mál abú-há (for abí-há) = out of the
moneys of her sire (iv. 190); and this is apparently the rule of the
writer.</p>

<p class="c000">Of Egyptianisms and vulgarisms we have Ant, má ghibtshayy
= thou, hast thou not been absent at all? with the shayy (a thing)
subjoined to the verb in this and similar other phrases; Baksísh for
Bakhshish (iv. 356); Al-Jawáz (for al-zíwáj) = marriage (i. 14);
Fakí or Fikí (for fakih) = a divine (vi. 207 and passim); Finjál
(for finján) = a coffee-cup (v. 424, also a Najdí or Central Arabian
corruption); Kuwayyis = nice, pretty (iv. 179); Láyálí (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">لايالى</span> for
liallá <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">لئلا</span>) = lest that (v. 285); Luhúmát (for luhúm) = meats, a
mere barbarism (v. 247); Matah (for Matá) = when? (v. 464);
Ma’áyah (for ma’í) = with me (vi. 13 et passim); Shuwayy (or
shuwayyah) Mayah, a double diminutive (for Muwayy or Muwayh)
= a small little water, intensely Nilotic (iv. 44); Mbarih or Embárah
(for Al-bárihah) = yesterday (v. 449); Takkat (for Dakkat)
= she rapped (iv. 190); Úzbáshá and Uzbáshá (for Yúzbáshí) =
a centurion, a captain (v. 430 et passim); Záídjah for Záijah
(vi. 329); Zarághít (for Zaghárít) = lullilooing (iv. 12); Zínah
(for Ziná) = adultery, and lastly Zúda (for Záda) = increased
(iv. 87). Here the reader will cry <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">jam satis</span>; while the student will
compare the list with that given in my Terminal Essay (vol. x.
168–9).</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>The two Appendices require no explanation. No. I. is a
Catalogue of the Tales in the Wortley Montague MS., and No. II.
contains Notes upon the Storiology of the Supplemental Volumes
IV. and V. by the practised pen of Mr. W. F. Kirby. The sheets
during my absence from England have been passed through the
press and sundry additions and corrections have been made by
Dr. Steingass.</p>

<p class="c000">In conclusion I would state that my hope was to see this
Volume (No. xv.) terminate my long task; but circumstance is
stronger than my will and I must ask leave to bring out one more—The
New Arabian Nights.</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE HISTORY OF THE KING’S SON OF SIND AND THE LADY FATIMAH.<a id="r3"></a><a href="#f3" class="c012"><sup>[3]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_3">3</span>It is related that whilome there was a King of the many Kings
of Sind who had a son by other than his wife. Now the youth,
whenever he entered the palace, would revile<a id="r4"></a><a href="#f4" class="c012"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and abuse and
curse and use harsh words to his step-mother, his father’s Queen,
who was beautiful exceedingly; and presently her charms were
changed and her face waxed wan and for the excess of what she
heard from him she hated life and fell to longing for death.
Withal she could not say a word concerning the Prince to his
parent. One day of the days, behold, an aged woman (which had
been her nurse) came in to her and saw her in excessive sorrow
and perplext as to her affair for that she knew not what she
could do with her step-son. So the ancient dame said to her, “O
my lady, no harm shall befal thee; yet is thy case changed into
other case and thy colour hath turned to yellow.” Hereupon
the Queen told her all that had befallen her from her step-son of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_4">4</span>harsh language and revilement and abuse, and the other rejoined,
“O my lady, let not thy breast be straitened, and when the
youth shall come to thee and revile and abuse thee, do thou say
him:—Pull thy wits somewhat together till such time as thou
shalt have brought back the Lady Fatimah, daughter of ’Ámir
ibn al-Nu’umán.” The old woman taught her these words by
heart, and anon went forth from her, when the Prince entered by
the door and spoke harsh words and abused and reviled her; so
his father’s wife said to him, “Lower thy tone and pull thy wits
somewhat together, for thou be a small matter until thou shalt
bring back the daughter of the Sultan, hight Fatimah, the
child of ’Amir ibn al-Nu’uman.” Now when he heard these words
he cried, “By Allah, ’tis not possible but that I go and return
with the said Lady Fatimah;” after which he repaired to his sire
and said, “’Tis my desire to travel; so do thou prepare for me
provision of all manner wherewith I may wend my way to a far
land, nor will I return until I win to my wish.” Hereupon his
father fell to transporting whatso he required of victuals various
and manifold, until all was provided, and he got ready for him
whatso befitted of bales and camels and pages and slaves and
eunuchs and negro chattels. Presently they loaded up and the
youth, having farewelled his father and his friends and his
familiars, set forth seeking the country of Fatimah bint Amir,
and he travelled for the first day and the second day until he
found himself in the middle of the wilds and the Wadys, and
the mountains and the stony wastes. This lasted for two months
till such time as he reached a region wherein were Ghúls and
ferals, and to one and all who met him and opposed him he would
give something of provaunt and gentle them and persuade them
to guide him upon his way. After a time he met a Shaykh well
stricken in years; so he salamed to him and the other, after
returning his greeting, asked him saying, “What was it brought
thee to this land and region wherein are naught but wild beasts
<span class="pageno" id="Page_5">5</span>and Ghuls?” whereto he answered, “O Shaykh, I came hither
for the sake of the Lady Fatimah, daughter of ’Amir ibn
al-Nu’uman.” Hereat exclaimed the greybeard, “Deceive not
thyself, for assuredly thou shalt be lost together with what are with
thee of men and moneys, and the maiden in question hath been
the cause of destruction to many Kings and Sultans. Her father
hath three tasks which he proposeth to every suitor, nor owneth
any the power to accomplish a single one, and he conditioneth
that if any fail to fulfil them and avail not so to do, he shall be
slain. But I, O my son, will inform thee of the three which be
these: First the King will bring together an ardabb of sesame
grain and an ardabb of clover-seed and an ardabb of lentils;
and he will mingle them one with other, and he will say:—Whoso
seeketh my daughter to wife, let him set apart each sort,
and whoso hath no power thereto I will smite his neck. And as
all have failed in the attempt their heads were struck off next
morning and were hung up over the Palace gateway. Now the
second task is this: the King hath a cistern<a id="r5"></a><a href="#f5" class="c012"><sup>[5]</sup></a> full of water, and he
conditioneth that the suitor shall drink it up to the last drop,
under pain of losing his life; and the third is as follows: he
owneth a house without doors and windows, and it hath<a id="r6"></a><a href="#f6" class="c012"><sup>[6]</sup></a> three
hundred entrances and a thousand skylights and two thousand
closets: so he covenanteth with the suitor that he make for that
place whatever befitteth of doors and lattices and cabinets, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_6">6</span>the whole in a single night. Now here is sufficient to engross
thine intellect, O my son, but take thou no heed and I will do
thy task for thee.” Quoth the other, “O my uncle, puissance and
omnipotence are to Allah!” and quoth the Shaykh, “Go, O my
son, and may the Almighty forward the works of thee.” So the
Prince farewelled him and travelled for the space of two days,
when suddenly the ferals and the Ghuls opposed his passage and
he gave them somewhat of provaunt which they ate, and after
they pointed out to him the right path. Then he entered upon a
Wady wherein flights of locusts barred the passage, so he scattered
for them somewhat of fine flour which they picked up till they
had eaten their sufficiency. Presently he found his way into
another valley of iron-bound rocks, and in it there were of the
Jánn what could not be numbered or described, and they cut
and crossed his way athwart that iron tract. So he came forward
and salam’d to them and gave them somewhat of bread and meat
and water, and they ate and drank till they were filled, after
which they guided him on his journey and set him in the right
direction. Then he fared forwards till he came to the middle
of the mountain, where he was opposed by none, or mankind or
Jinn-kind, and he ceased not marching until he drew near the
city of the Sultan whose daughter he sought to wife. Here he
set up a tent and sat therein seeking repose for a term of three
days; then he arose and walked forwards until he entered the
city, where he fell to looking about him leftwards and rightwards
till he had reached the palace<a id="r7"></a><a href="#f7" class="c012"><sup>[7]</sup></a> of the King. He found there over
the gateway some hundred heads which were hanging up, and he
cried to himself, “Veil me, O thou Veiler! All these skulls were
suspended for the sake of the Lady Fatimah, but the bye-word
saith:—Whoso dieth not by the sword dieth of his life-term,
and manifold are the causes whereas death be singlefold.” Thereupon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_7">7</span>he went forwards to the palace gate——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased
saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the
next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will!—It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
went forward to the Palace gate and purposed to enter, but they
forbade him nor availed he to go in; so he returned to his tents
and there spent the night till dawn. Then he again turned to the
King’s Serai and attempted to make entry, but they stayed him
and he was unable to succeed, nor could he attain to the presence
of the Sovran. So he devised with one who was standing at the
door a device to enter the presence, but again he failed in his
object and whenever he craved admission they rejected him
and drave him away saying, “O youth, tell us what may be thy
need?” Said he, “I have a requirement of the Sultan and my
purport is a business I may transact with him and speech
containeth both private and public matters; nor is it possible
that I mention my want to any save to the Sovran.” So a
Chamberlain of the chamberlains went in to the presence and
reported the affair to the King, who permitted them admit the
stranger, and when he stood before the throne he kissed ground
<span class="pageno" id="Page_8">8</span>and deprecated evil for the ruler and prayed for his glory and
permanency, and the Monarch, who marvelled at the terseness of
his tongue and the sweetness of his speech, said to him, “O youth,
what may be thy requirement?” Quoth the Prince, “Allah
prolong the reign of our lord the Sultan! I came to thee seeking
connexion with thee through thy daughter the lady concealed
and the pearl unrevealed.” Quoth the Sultan, “By Allah, verily
this youth would doom himself hopelessly to die and, Oh the
pity of it for the loquence of his language;” presently adding,
“O youth, say me, art thou satisfied with the conditions wherewith
I would oblige thee?” and the Prince replied, “O my lord,
Omnipotence is to Allah; and, if the Almighty empower me to
fulfil thy pact, I shall fulfil it.” The King continued, “I have
three tasks to impose upon thee,” and the Prince rejoined, “I am
satisfied with all articles thou shalt appoint.” Hereupon the
Sovran summoned the writers and witnesses, and they indited the
youth’s covenant and gave testimony that he was content therewith;
and when the Prince had signified his satisfaction and
obligation, the King sent for an ardabb of sesame and an ardabb
of clover-seed and an ardabb of lentils and let mingle all three
kinds one with other till they became a single heap. Then said
the King to the Prince, “Do thou separate each sort by itself
during the course of the coming night, and if dawn shall arise and
every seed is not set apart, I will cut off thy head.” Replied the
other, “Hearing and obeying.” Then the King bade place all
the mixed heap in a stead apart, and commanded the suitor retire
into solitude; accordingly, he passed alone into that site and
looked upon that case and condition, and he sat beside the heap
deep in thought, so he set his hand upon his cheek and fell to
weeping, and was certified of death. Anon he arose and going
forwards attempted of himself to separate the various sorts of
grain, but he failed; and had two hundred thousand thousands of
men been gathered together for the work they had on nowise
<span class="pageno" id="Page_9">9</span>availed to it. Hereupon he set his right hand upon his cheek<a id="r8"></a><a href="#f8" class="c012"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
and he fell to weeping and suffered the first third of the dark hours
to pass, when he said to himself, “There remaineth naught of thy
life save the remnant of this night!” But the while he was conjecturing
and taking thought, behold, an army of the locusts to
whom he had thrown the flour upon his road came speeding over
him like a cloud dispread and said to him with the tongue of the
case,<a id="r9"></a><a href="#f9" class="c012"><sup>[9]</sup></a> “Fear not neither grieve, for we have flocked hither to
solace thee and ward from thee the woe wherein thou art: so take
thou no further heed.” Then they proceeded to separate each
kind of grain and set it by itself, and hardly an hour had passed
before the whole sample was distributed grain by grain into its
proper place while he sat gazing thereon. After this the locusts
arose and went their ways, and when morning dawned the Sultan
came forth and took seat in the Hall of Commandment and said
to those who were present, “Arise ye and bring hither the youth
that we may cut off his head.” They did his bidding but, when
entering in to the Prince, they found all the different grains piled
separately, sesame by itself and clover-seed alone and lentils
distributed apart, whereat they marvelled and cried, “This thing
is indeed a mighty great matter from this youth, nor could it
befal any save himself of those who came before him or of those
who shall follow after him.” Presently they brought him to the
Sultan and said, “O King of the Age, all the grains are sorted;”
whereat the Sovran wondered and exclaimed, “Bring the whole
before me.” And when they brought it he looked upon it with
amazement and rejoiced thereat, but soon recovered himself and
cried, “O youth, there remain to thee two tasks for two nights;
and if thou fulfil them, thou shalt win to thy wish, and if thou fail
therein, I will smite thy neck.” Said the Prince, “O King of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_10">10</span>Age, the All-might is to Allah, the One, the Omnipotent!” Now
when night drew nigh the King opened to him a cistern and
said, “Drink up all that is herein and leave not of it a drop, nor
spill aught thereof upon the ground, and if thou drain the whole
of it, thou shalt indeed attain to thine aim, but if thou fail
to swallow it, I will smite thy neck.” The Prince answered,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!” Then he took his seat at the cistern-mouth
and fell to thinking and saying in his mind, “Wherefore,
O certain person, shouldst thou venture thy life and incur the
cruel consequence of this King on account of thy frowardness
to thy father’s wife? and by Allah, this is naught save Jinn-struck
madness on thy part!” So he placed his left hand upon his
cheek, and in his right was a stick wherewith he tapped and drew
lines in absent fashion upon the ground,<a id="r10"></a><a href="#f10" class="c012"><sup>[10]</sup></a> and he wept and wailed
until the third of the first part of the dark hours had passed,
when he said in himself, “There remaineth naught of thine age,
ho, Such-an-one, save the remainder of this night.” And he
ceased not to be drowned in thought when suddenly a host of
savage beasts and wild birds came up to him and said with the
tongue of the case, “Fear not neither grieve, O youth, for none is
faithless to the food save the son of adultery and thou wast the
first to work our weal, so we will veil and protect thee, and let
there be no sorrowing with thee on account of this matter.”
Hereupon they gathered together in a body, birds and beasts,
and they were like unto a lowering cloud, no term to them was
shown and no end was known as they followed in close file one
upon other——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day,
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_11">11</span>how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Four Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the wild beasts
and the feral birds met one another beside that cistern and each
took his turn thereat and drank without drinking his full<a id="r11"></a><a href="#f11" class="c012"><sup>[11]</sup></a> until
naught of water remained in the reservoir and they fell to licking
the sides with their tongues so that anyone seeing it would say
that for the last ten years not a drop of liquid had been stored
therein. And after this they all went their ways. Now as soon
as it was morning-tide the King arose and hied forth the Harem
and taking his seat in the Hall of Commandment said to sundry
of his pages and Chamberlains, “Go bring us tidings of the
cistern.” Accordingly they went thither and inspected it but
found no trace of water therein; so they returned straightway
to the ruler and reported the matter. Hereupon the Sultan was
amazed and his wits were bewildered and he was certified that
none had power to win his daughter for wife save that youth. So
he cried, “Bring him hither,” and they fared to fetch him and
presented him in the presence where he salam’d to the Sovran and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_12">12</span>deprecated<a id="r12"></a><a href="#f12" class="c012"><sup>[12]</sup></a> for him and prayed for him. The Sultan greeted him
in return and said, “O Youth, there now remaineth with me but a
single task which if thou accomplish shall save thee and win for
thee my daughter; however if thou fail therein I will smite thy
neck.” “Power is to Allah!” exclaimed the Prince whereat the
Sultan marvelled and said in his mind, “Glory be to God:
the words and works of this youth be wonderful. Whatever I bid
him do he beginneth with naming the name of the Lord whereas
those who forewent him never suffered me hear aught of the sort.
However, the fortunate are Fortune’s favourites and Misfortune
never befalleth them.” Now when it was night-tide the Sultan
said, “O youth, in very deed this mansion which standeth beside
the palace is brand-new and therein are store of wood and timbers
of every kind, but it lacketh portals and lattices and the finishing
of the cabinets; so I desire that thou make for it doors and
windows and closets. I have provided thee with everything thou
dost require of carpenter’s gear and turner’s lathes; and either
thou shalt work all this during the coming night; or, if thou be
wanting in aught and morning shall morrow without all the needful
being finished, I will cut off thy head. This is the fine of thy
three labours which an thou avail to accomplish thou shalt attain
thine aim and if thou fail thereof I will smite thy neck. Such be
then my last word.” Accordingly the Prince arose and faring
from before him entered the unfinished mansion which he found to
be a palace greater and grander than that wherein the King abode.
He cried, “O Veiler, withdraw not Thy veiling!” and he sat
therein by himself (and he drowned in thought) and said, “By
Allah, if at this hour I could find somewhat to swallow I would die
thereby and rest from this toil and trouble have been my lot;<a id="r13"></a><a href="#f13" class="c012"><sup>[13]</sup></a> and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_13">13</span>the morning shall not morrow ere I shall find repose nor shall any
one of the town folk solace himself and say:—The Sultan is about
to cut off the head of this youth. Withal the bye-word hath
it:—Joyance which cometh from Allah is nearer than is the
eyebrow to the eye, and if Almighty (be He extolled and exalted!)
have determined aught to my destiny, there is no flight therefrom.
Moreover one of the Sages hath said:—He released me from
pillar to post and the Almighty bringeth happiness nearhand.
From this time until dawn of day many a matter may proceed from
the Lord wherein haply shall be salvation for me or destruction.”
Then he fell to pondering his affair and thinking over his frowardness
to the wife of his father, after which he said, “The slave
meditateth and the Lord determineth, nor doth the meditation of
the slave accord with the determination of the Lord.” And
while thus drowned in care he heard the sound of the Darabukkah-drum<a id="r14"></a><a href="#f14" class="c012"><sup>[14]</sup></a>
and the turmoil of work and the shiftings of voices whilst
the house was full of forms dimly seen and a voice cried out
to him, “O youth, be hearty of heart and sprightly of spirits:
verily we will requite thee the kindness thou wroughtest to us in
providing us with thy provision; and we will come to thine aidance
this very night, for they who are visiting and assisting thee are of
the Jánn from the Valley of Iron.” Then they began taking up
the timbers and working them and some turned the wood with
lathes, and other planed the material with planes, whilst others
again fell to painting and dyeing the doors and windows, these
green and those red and those yellow; and presently they set them
in their several steads, nor did that night go by ere the labour was
perfected and there was no royal palace like unto it, either in
ordinance or in emplacement. Now as morning morrowed the
Sultan went forth to his divan, and when he looked abroad he saw a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_14">14</span>somewhat of magnificence in the mansion which was not to be
found in his palace, so he said in his surprise, “By Allah, the
works of this youth be wondrous and had the joiners and carpenters
loitered over three years upon this work they never would
have fulfilled such task: moreover we ken not by what manner of
means this young man hath been able to accomplish the labour.”
Thereupon he sent for the Prince to the presence and robed him
with a sumptuous robe of honour and assigned to him a mighty
matter of money, saying, “Verily thou deservest, O youth, and
thou art the only one who meriteth that thou become to my
daughter baron and she become to thee femme.” Presently Sultan
Amir ibn al-Nu’uman bade tie the marriage-tie and led to her in
procession the bridegroom who found her a treasure wherefrom
the talisman had been loosed;<a id="r15"></a><a href="#f15" class="c012"><sup>[15]</sup></a> and the bride rejoiced with even
more joyance than he did by cause of her sire, with his three tasks,
having made her believe that she would never be wedded and
bedded but die a maid, and she had long been in sadness for such
reason. Then the married couple abode with the King their father
for the space of a month, and all this time the camp of the young
Prince remained pitched without the town, and every day he
would send to his pages and eunuchs whatso they needed of meat
and drink. But when that term ended he craved from the Sultan
leave of travel to his own land and his father-in-law answered,
“O youth, do whatso thou ever wishest anent returning to thy
native realm;” and forthwith fell to fitting out his daughter till
all her preparations were completed and she was found ready for
wayfare together with her body-women and eunuchs. The Prince
having farewelled his father-in-law caused his loads to be loaded
and set out seeking his native country and kingdom; and he
travelled by day and by night, and he pushed his way through
<span class="pageno" id="Page_15">15</span>Wadys and over mountains for a while of time until he drew near
his own land, and between him and his father’s city remained only
some two or three marches. Here suddenly men met him upon
the road and as he asked them the tidings they replied that his sire
was besieged within his capital of Sind by a neighbour King who
had attacked him and determined to dethrone him and make
himself Sovereign and Sultan in his stead. Now when he heard
this account he pushed forward with forced marches till he reached
his father’s city which he found as had been reported; and the old
King with all his forces was girded around within his own walls
nor could he sally out to offer battle for that the foe was more
forceful than himself. Hereupon the Prince pitched his camp and
prepared himself for fight and fray; and a many of his men rode
with him whilst another many remained on guard at the tents.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

    <div>The Four Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
busked him for fight and fray seeking to assault the army of the
King who had besieged his sire, and the two hosts fought together
a strenuous fight and a stubborn. On this wise fared it with them;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_16">16</span>but as regards the bride, she took patience till such time as her
bridegroom had ridden forth, when she donned her weapons of war
and veiled herself with a face-veil and sallying forth in Mameluke’s
habit presently came up with her mate the Prince whom she found
straitened by the multitude of his foes. Now this Princess was
mistress of all manner weapons, so she drew her sword from its
sheath and she laid on load rightwards and leftwards until the wits
of all beholders were wildered and her bridegroom inclined to her
and said, “Verily this Mameluke he is not one of our party.” But
she continued battling till the sun rose high in the firmament-vault
when she determined to attack the ensigns and colours which were
flying after right royal of fashion, and in the midst thereof was the
hostile Sultan. So she smote the ancient who bore the banner
and cast him to the ground and then she made for the King and
charged down upon him and struck him with the side of the sword
a blow so sore that of his affright he fell from his steed. But when
his host saw him unhorsed and prostrate upon the plain they
sought safety in flight and escape, deeming him to be dead; whereupon
she alighted and pinioned his elbows behind his back and
tied his forearms to his side, and lashed him on to his charger and
bound him in bonds like a captive vile. Then she committed him
to her bridegroom who still knew her not and she departed the
field seeking her camp until she arrived there and entered her
pavilion where she changed her attire and arrayed herself in
women’s raiment. After this she sat down expecting the Prince
who, when she had committed to him the captured King, carried
him into the city where he found the gates thrown open. Hereupon
his sire sallied forth and greeted him albeit he recognized
him not but was saying, “Needs must I find the Knight who came
to our assistance.” “O my papa,” quoth the Prince, “dost thou
not know me?” and quoth the other, “O young man, I know thee
not;” whereat the other rejoined, “I am thy son Such-an-one.”
But hardly had the old King heard these words when behold, he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_17">17</span>fell upon him and threw his arms round his neck and was like to
lose his sense and his senses for stress of joyance. After a time he
recovered and looking upon the captive King asked him, “What
was it drave thee to come hither and seek to seize from me my
realm?” and the other answered him with humility and craved
his pardon and promised not again to offend, so he released him
and bade him gang his gait. After this the young Prince went
forth and caused his Harim and his pages and whoso were with
him enter the city and when they were seated in the women’s
apartment the husband and wife fell to talking of their journey
and what they had borne therein of toil and travail. At last the
Princess said to him, “O my lord, what became of the King who
besieged thy sire in his capital and who sought to bereave him of
his realm?” and said he, “I myself took him captive and committed
him to my father who admitted his excuses and suffered
him depart.” Quoth she, “And was it thou who capturedst him?”
and quoth he, “Yea verily, none made him prisoner save myself.”
Hereupon said she, “Thee it besitteth not to become after thy sire
Sovran and Sultan!” and said he, “Why and wherefore?” “For
that a lie defameth and dishonoureth the speaker,” cried she, “and
thou hast proved thee a liar.” “What made it manifest to thee
that I lied?” asked the Prince, and the Princess answered, “Thou
claimest to have captured the King when it was other than thyself
took him prisoner and committed him to thy hands.” He enquired,
“And who was he?” and she replied, “I know not, withal I had
him in sight.” Hereupon the bridegroom repeated his query till at
last she confessed it was she had done that deed of derring-do; and
the Prince rejoiced much in her.<a id="r16"></a><a href="#f16" class="c012"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Then the twain made an entry
<span class="pageno" id="Page_18">18</span>in triumph and the city was adorned and the general joy was
increased. Now his taking to wife the Lady Fatimah daughter of
the Sultan Amir bin Al-Nu’uman so reconciled him to his step-mother,
the spouse of his father the Sovran of Sind, that both
forgot their differences and they lived ever afterwards in harmony
and happiness.</p>

  <h2 class="c006">HISTORY OF THE LOVERS OF SYRIA.<a id="r17"></a><a href="#f17" class="c012"><sup>[17]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_21">21</span>It is stated that of olden times and by-gone there dwelt in the
land of Syria two men which were brothers and whereof one was
wealthy and the other was needy. Now the rich man had a lovesome
daughter and a lovely, whilst the poor man had a son who
gave his heart to his cousin as soon as his age had reached his
tenth year. But at that time his father the pauper died and he
was left an orphan without aught of the goods of this world; the
damsel his cousin, however, loved him with exceeding love and
ever and anon would send him a somewhat of dirhams and this
continued till both of them attained their fourteenth years. Then
the youth was minded to marry the daughter of his uncle, so he
sent a party of friends to her home by way of urging his claim
that the father might wed her to him, but the man rejected them
and they returned disappointed. However, when it was the second
day a body of warm men and wealthy came to ask for the maid in
marriage, and they conditioned the needful conditions and stood
agreed upon the nuptials. Presently the tidings reached the
damsel who took patience till the noon o’ night, when she arose
and sought the son of her uncle, bringing with her a sum of two
thousand dinars which she had taken of her father’s good and she
knocked softly at the door. Hereupon the youth started from
sleep and went forth and found his cousin who was leading a she-mule
and an ass, so the twain bestrode either beast and travelled
through the remnant of the night until the morning morrowed.
Then they alighted to drink and to hide themselves in fear of being
<span class="pageno" id="Page_22">22</span>seen until the second night fell when they mounted and rode for
two successive days, at the end of which they entered a town
seated on the shore of the sea. Here they found a ship equipped
for voyage, so they repaired to the Ra’is and hired for themselves
a sitting place; after which the cousin went forth to sell the ass
and the she-mule, and disappeared for a short time. Meanwhile
the ship had sailed with the daughter of his uncle and had left
the youth upon the strand and ceased not sailing day after day for
the space of ten days, and lastly made the port she purposed and
there cast anchor.<a id="r18"></a><a href="#f18" class="c012"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Thus it befel them; but as regards the youth,
when he had sold the beasts he returned to the ship and found
her not, and when he asked tidings thereof they told him that she
had put to sea; and hearing this he was mazed as to his mind and
sore amated as to his affair, nor wot he whither he should wend.
So he turned him inland sore dismayed. Now when the vessel
anchored in that port quoth the damsel to the captain, “O Ra’is,<a id="r19"></a><a href="#f19" class="c012"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
hie thee ashore and bring for us a portion of flesh and fresh bread,”
and quoth he, “Hearkening and obedience,” whereupon he betook
himself to the town. But as soon as he was far from the vessel
she arose and donning male’s dress said to the sailors, “Do ye
weigh anchor and set sail,” and she shouted at them with the
shouting of seamen. Accordingly they did as she bade them and
the wind being fair and the weather favourable, ere an hour had
sped they passed beyond sight of land.<a id="r20"></a><a href="#f20" class="c012"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Presently the captain
<span class="pageno" id="Page_23">23</span>returned bringing bread and meat but he found ne’er a ship, so
he asked tidings of her and they answered, “Verily she is gone.”
Hereupon he was perplext and he fell to striking hand upon hand
and crying out, “O my good and the good of folk!” and he
repented whenas repentance availed him naught. Accordingly, he
returned to the town unknowing whither he should wend and he
walked about like one blind and deaf for the loss of his craft. But as
regards the vessel, she ceased not sailing with those within till she
cast anchor near a city wherein was a King; and no sooner was
she made fast than the damsel arose and donning her most
sumptuous dress and decorations fell to scattering money amongst
the crew and saying to them, “Hearten your hearts and be not
afraid on any wise!” In due time the news of a fresh arrival
reached the Ruler, and he ordered his men to bring him tidings
concerning that vessel, and when they went for her and boarded
her they found that her captain was a damsel of virginal semblance
exceeding in beauty and loveliness. So they returned and reported
this to the King who despatched messengers bidding her lodge
with him for they had heightened their praises of her and the
excess of her comeliness, and he said in his mind, “By Allah, an
she prove as they describe her, needs must I marry her.” But the
damsel sent back saying, “I am a clean maid, nor may I land
alone but do thou send to me forty girls, virgins like myself when
I will disembark together with them.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”

    <div>The Five Hundred and Third Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede, which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the damsel
demanded of the King forty clean maids and said, “We will land,
I and they together,” whereto he replied, “The right is with her.”
Hereupon he ordered all those about him, the Lords of his land
and the Commons, that each and every who had in the house a
virginal daughter, should bring her to him until the full tale of
forty (the daughter of the Wazir being amongst them) was told
and he sent them on board the ship where the damsel was about
sitting down to supper. But as soon as the maidens came she met
them in her finest attire, none of the number being more beauteous
than herself, and she salam’d to them and invited them into the
cuddy<a id="r21"></a><a href="#f21" class="c012"><sup>[21]</sup></a> where she bade food be served to them and they ate and
were cheered and solaced, after which they sat down to converse
till it was the middle of the night. Now when sleep prevailed
over the girls they retired to their several berths, and when they
were drowned in slumber, the damsel arose softly and arousing
the crew bade them leave their moorings and shake out their
canvas; nor did daylight dawn to them ere they had covered a far
distance. As soon as the maidens awoke they saw themselves on
board a ship amid the billows of the main, and as they asked the
Captainess she answered, “Fear not for yourselves or for the
voyage you are making;”<a id="r22"></a><a href="#f22" class="c012"><sup>[22]</sup></a> and she gentled them and solaced them
<span class="pageno" id="Page_25">25</span>until whatso was in their hearts was allayed. However, touching
the affair of the King, when morrowed the morn he sent to the ship
with an order for the damsel to land with the forty virgins, but
they found not the craft and they returned and reported the same
to their lord, who cried, “By Allah, this be the discreetest of deeds
which none other save she could have done.” So he arose without
stay or delay and taking with him the Wazir (both being in disguise),
he went down to the shore and looked around but he could
not find what had become of them. And as regards the vessel carrying
the virgins she ceased not sailing until she made port beside a
ruined city wherein was none inhabitant, and here the crew cast
anchor and furled their sails when behold, a gang of forty pirate<a id="r23"></a><a href="#f23" class="c012"><sup>[23]</sup></a>
men, ever ready to cut the highway and their friends to betray,
boarded them, crying in high glee, “Let us slay all in her and
carry off whatso we find.” When they appeared before the damsel
they would have effected their intent; but she welcomed them and
said, “Do ye return ashore: we be forty maids and ye forty men
and to each of you shall befal one and I will belong to your
Shaykh, for that I am the Captainess.” Now when they heard
this they rejoiced with excessive joy and they said, “Walláhi, our
night shall be a blessed one by virtue of your coming to us;”
whereto she asked, “Have you with you aught of sheep?” They
answered, “We have,” and quoth she, “Do ye slay of them
somewhat for supper and fetch the meat that we may cook it for
you.” So a troop of pirates went off and brought back ten lambs
which they slaughtered and flayed and brittled. Then the damsel
and those with her tucked up their sleeves and hung up their
chauldrons<a id="r24"></a><a href="#f24" class="c012"><sup>[24]</sup></a> and cooked the meat after delicatest fashion, and when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_26">26</span>it was thoroughly done and prepared, they spread the trays and
the pirates came forward one and all, and ate and washed their
hands and they were in high spirits each and every saying, “This
night I will take to me a girl.” Lastly she brought to them coffee
which they drank, but hardly had it settled in their maws when
the Forty Thieves fell to the ground, for she had mixed up with
it flying Bhang<a id="r25"></a><a href="#f25" class="c012"><sup>[25]</sup></a> and those who had drunk thereof became like
unto dead men. Hereupon the damsel arose without loss of time
and taking in her hand a sharp-grided sword fell to cutting off
their heads and casting them into the sea until she came to the
Shaykh of the Pirates and in his case she was satisfied with
shaving his beard and tearing out his eye-teeth and bidding the
crew cast him ashore. They did as she commanded, after which
she conveyed the property of all the caitiffs and having distributed
the booty amongst the sailors, bade them weigh anchor and shake
out their canvas. On this wise they left that ruined city until they
had made the middle of the main and they fared for a number of
days athwart the billowy deep nor could they hit upon their course
amongst the courses of the sea until Destiny cast them beside a
city. They made fast to the anchorage-ground, and the damsel
arose and donning Mameluke’s dress and arraying the Forty
Virgins in the same attire all walked together and paced about the
shore and they were like garden blooms. When they entered the
streets they found all the folk a-sorrowing, so they asked one of
them and he answered, “The Sultan who over-reigneth this city is
dead and the reign lacketh rule.” Now in that stead and under
the hand of the Wazir, was a Bird which they let loose at certain
times, and whenever he skimmed round and perched upon the head
of any man to him they would give the Sultanate.<a id="r26"></a><a href="#f26" class="c012"><sup>[26]</sup></a> By the decree
<span class="pageno" id="Page_27">27</span>of the Decreer they cast the fowl high in air at the very hour
when the damsel was landing and he hovered above her and
settled upon her head (she being in slave’s attire), and the city
folk and the lords of the land cried out, “Strange! passing
strange!” So they flushed the bird from the place where he had
alighted and on the next day they freed him again at a time when
the damsel had left the ship, and once more he came and settled
upon her head. They drove him away, crying, “Oh rare! oh
rare!” but as often as they started him from off her head he
returned to it and alighted there again. “Marvellous!” cried the
Wazir, “but Allah Almighty hath done this<a id="r27"></a><a href="#f27" class="c012"><sup>[27]</sup></a> and none shall object
to what He doeth nor shall any reject what He decreeth.” Accordingly,
they gave her the Sultanate together with the signet-ring of
governance and the turband of commandment and they seated her
upon the throne of the reign. Hereupon she fell to ordering the
Forty Virgins who were still habited as Mamelukes and they served
the Sultan for a while of time, till one day of the days when the
Wazir came to the presence and said, “O King of the Age, I have
a daughter, a model of beauty and loveliness and I am desirous
of wedding her with the Sovran because one such as thou should
not remain in single blessedness.”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent, and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Five Hundred and Fifth Night.</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
Wazir to the Sultan, “I have a daughter, a model of beauty and
loveliness, and I am desirous of wedding her with the Sultan,
because one such as thou should not remain in single blessedness.”
“Do whatso thou wishest,” quoth the King, “and Allah prosper
thy doing.” Hereupon the Wazir fell to preparing the marriage-portion<a id="r28"></a><a href="#f28" class="c012"><sup>[28]</sup></a>
of his daughter, and of forwarding her affair with the
Sultan, until her wedding appointments<a id="r29"></a><a href="#f29" class="c012"><sup>[29]</sup></a> and other matters were
completed. After this he caused the marriage-tie be tied, and
he brought her to the supposed Sultan where she lay for the first
night, but the damsel having performed the Wuzú ablution did
naught but pray through the hours of darkness. When dawned
the day the Wazir’s wife which was the mother of the maiden
came to look upon her daughter and asked her of her case, and
the bride answered, “All the livelong night hath he passed in
orisons, nor came he near me even once.” Quoth the mother,
“O my daughter, this be the first night, and assuredly he was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_29">29</span>ashamed, for he is young in years, and he knoweth not what to
do; haply also his heart hangeth not upon thee; and he is but a
raw lad.<a id="r30"></a><a href="#f30" class="c012"><sup>[30]</sup></a> However, on the coming night ye shall both enjoy your
desire.” But as soon as it was the evening of the next day the
Sultan went in to his Harim and made the minor ablution, and
abode in prayer through the night until the morrow morrowed,
when again the mother came to see how matters stood, and
she asked her daughter, who answered, “All the dark hours
he hath passed in devotion, and he never approached me.” Now
on the third night it happened after like fashion, so the mother
said, “O my daughter, whenever thou shalt see thy husband sitting
by thy side, do thou throw thyself upon his bosom.” The bride
did as she was bidden, and casting herself upon his breast cried,
“O King of the Age, haply I please thee not at all;” whereat said
the other, “O light of mine eyes, thou art a joy to me for ever;
but I am about to confide to thee somewhat and say me canst thou
keep a secret?” Quoth she, “Who is there like me for hiding
things in my heart?” and quoth the other, “I am a clean maid,
and my like is thy like, but the reason for my being in man’s habit
is that the son of my uncle, who is my betrothed, hath been lost
from me and I have been lost from him, but when Allah shall
decree the reunion of our lots he shall marry thee first and he shall
not pay the bridegroom’s visit save unto thee, and after that to
myself.” The Wazir’s daughter accepted the excuse, and then
arising went forth and brought a pigeon whose weazand she split
and whose blood she daubed upon the snow-white sheet.<a id="r31"></a><a href="#f31" class="c012"><sup>[31]</sup></a> And
when it was morning and her mother again visited her, the bride
<span class="pageno" id="Page_30">30</span>showed her this proof of her pucelage, and she rejoiced thereat and
her father rejoiced also. After this the Sultan ruled for a while of
time, but she was ever in deep thought concerning what device
could be devised in order to obtain tidings of her father and her
cousin and what had wrought with them the changes of times and
tides. So she bade edify a magnificent Hammám and by its side
a coffee house,<a id="r32"></a><a href="#f32" class="c012"><sup>[32]</sup></a> both nearhand to the palace, and forthwith she
summoned architects and masons and plasterers and painters, and
when all came between her hands she said to them, “Do ye take
a long look at my semblance and mark well my features for I desire
that you make me a carven image<a id="r33"></a><a href="#f33" class="c012"><sup>[33]</sup></a> which shall resemble me in all
points, and that you fashion it according to my form and figure,
and you adorn it aright and render it to represent my very self in
all proportions, and then bring it to me.” They obeyed her order
and brought her a statue which was herself to a nail, so she looked
upon it and was pleased therewith. Then she ordered them set the
image over the Hammam-door, so they placed it there, and after
she issued a firman and caused it to be cried through the city that
whoso should enter that Bath to bathe and drink coffee, should do
so free and gratis and for naught. When this was done the tongues
of the folk were loosed with benison, and they fell to praying for
the Sultan and the endurance of his glory, and the permanence of
his governance till such time as the bruit was spread abroad by the
caravans and travellers, and the folk of all regions had heard of the
Hammam and the coffee-house. Meanwhile the Sultan had summoned
two eunuchs and ordered them and repeatedly enjoined them
that whoso might approach the statue and consider it straitly him
should they seize and bring before the presence. Accordingly, the
slaves fared forth and took their seats before the doors of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_31">31</span>baths. After a while of time the father of the damsel who
had become Sultan wandered forth to seek her,<a id="r34"></a><a href="#f34" class="c012"><sup>[34]</sup></a> and arrived at
that city, where he heard that whoso entered the Hammam
to bathe and afterwards drank coffee did this without cost;
so he said in his mind, “Let me go thither and enjoy myself.”
Then he repaired to the building and designed to enter, when
behold, he looked at the statue over the gateway, and he stood
still and considered it with the tears flowing adown his cheeks, and
he cried, “Indeed this figure be like her!” But when the eunuchs
saw him they seized him and carried him away until they had led
him to the Sultan his daughter, who, seeing him, recognised him
forthright, and bade set apart for him an apartment and appointed
to him rations for the time being. The next that appeared was
the son of her uncle, who also had wandered as far as that city
seeking his cousin, and he also having heard the folk speaking
anent a free entrance to the Baths, said in himself, “Do thou get
thee like others to that Hammam and solace thyself.” But when
he arrived there he also cast a look at that image and stood before
it and wept for an hour or so as he devoured it with his eyes, when
the eunuchry beholding him seized and carried him off to the Sultan,
who knew him at first sight. So she bade prepare a place for him
and appointed to him rations for the time being. Then also came
the Ra’is of the ship, who had reached that city seeking his lost
vessel, and when the fame of the free Hammam came to his ears,
he said in his mind, “Go thou to the Baths and solace thyself.”
And when he arrived there and looked upon the statue and fixed
his glance upon it he cried out, “Walláhi! ’tis her very self.”
Hereupon the eunuchry seized him and carried him to the Sultan
who seeing him recognized him and placed him in a place apart
for a while of time. Anon the King and the Wazir, who were
<span class="pageno" id="Page_32">32</span>responsible for the Forty Virgins came to that city.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent, and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night?” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that the King accompanied
by the Wazir came to that city seeking the lost Forty
Virgins and when the twain had settled there and were stablisht
at ease their souls longed for the Baths and they said each to
other, “Hie we to the Hammam that we may wash away the dirt
which be the result of travel.” So they repaired to the place and
as they entered the gateway they looked up and fixed their eyes
upon the statue; and, as they continued to gaze thereupon, the
eunuchs who sighted them seized them and carried them off to
the Sultan.<a id="r35"></a><a href="#f35" class="c012"><sup>[35]</sup></a> When they stood between her hands and they
beheld the Forty Mamelukes who were also before her, the Wazir’s
glance happened to fall upon his daughter who was on similar wise
in slave’s habit, and he looked at her with the tears flowing adown
his cheeks and he said in his mind, “Walláhi! Verily this Mameluke
is like my child as like can be.” Hereupon the Sultan considered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_33">33</span>the twain<a id="r36"></a><a href="#f36" class="c012"><sup>[36]</sup></a> and asked them of their case<a id="r37"></a><a href="#f37" class="c012"><sup>[37]</sup></a> and they answered,
“We be Such-and-such and we are wandering about to seek our
daughter and her nine-and-thirty maidens.” Hereupon she
assigned to them also lodgings and rations for the present. Lastly
appeared the Pirate which had been Shaykh and comrade of the
Forty Thieves also seeking that city, and albeit he was aweary and
perplext yet he ceased not to wander that he might come upon
the damsel who had slain his associates and who had shaved his
beard and had torn out his eye teeth. He also when he heard of
the Hammam without charge and the free coffee-house said in
himself, “Hie thee to that place!” and as he was entering the
gateway he beheld the image and stood still and fell to speaking
fulsome speech and crying aloud and saying, “By Allah, this
statue is likest to her in stature and size and, by the Almighty, if
I can only lay my hand upon her and seize her I will slaughter
her even as one cutteth a mutton’s throat. Ah! Ah! an I could
but catch hold of her.” As he spake these words the eunuchry
heard him; so they seized him and dragged him along and
carried him before the Sultan who no sooner saw him and knew
him than she ordered him to jail. And they imprisoned him for
he had not come to that city save for the shortening of his days
and the lavishing of his life-blood and he knew not what was
predestined to him and in very sooth he deserved all that befel
him. Hereupon the damsel bade bring before her, her father and
her cousin and the Ra’is and the King and the Wazir and the
Pirate (while she still bore herself as one who administered the
Sultanate), and when it became night time all began to converse
one with other and presently quoth she to them, “O folk, let each
and every who hath a tale solace us with telling it.” Hereat
quoth one and all of them, “We wist not a recital nor can we
<span class="pageno" id="Page_34">34</span>recount one;” and she rejoined, “I will relate unto you an
adventure.” They cried, “O King of the Age, pardon us! for
how shalt thou rehearse us an history and we sit listening
thereto?”<a id="r38"></a><a href="#f38" class="c012"><sup>[38]</sup></a> and she replied, “Forasmuch as you have no say to
say, I will speak in your stead that we may shorten this our night.”
Then she continued, “There was a merchant man and a wealthy
with a brother which was needy, and the richard had a daughter
while the pauper had a son. But when the poor man died he left
only the boy who sought to marry the girl his cousin: his paternal
uncle, however, refused him maugre that she loved him and she
was beloved of him. Presently there came a party of substantial
merchants who demanded her in wedlock and obtained her and
agreed upon the conditions; when her sire was minded to marry
her to their man. This was hard upon the damsel and sore
grievous to her so she said:—By Allah, I will mate with none
save with my uncle’s son. Then she came to him at midnight
leading a she-mule and an ass and bringing somewhat of her
father’s moneys and she knocked at the youth’s door and he came
out to her and both went forth, he and she, in the outer darkness
of that murky night and the Veiler veiled her way.” Now when
the father and the cousin heard this adventure they threw themselves
on her neck,<a id="r39"></a><a href="#f39" class="c012"><sup>[39]</sup></a> and rejoiced in her until the turn came for
her recounting the tale of the merchant-captain and he also
approved her and was solaced by her words. Then, as she related
the history concerning the King and the Wazir, they said, “By
Allah, this indeed is a sweet story and full of light and leading
<span class="pageno" id="Page_35">35</span>and our lord the Sultan deserveth for this recital whatso he may
require.” But when she came to the Pirate he cried, “Walláhi,
O our lord the Sultan, this adventure is a grievous, and Allah
upon thee, tell us some other tale;” whereat all the hearers
rejoined, “By Allah, in very sooth the recital is a pleasing.” She
continued to acquaint them with the adventure of the Bird which
invested her with the monarchy and she ended with relating the
matter of the Hammam, at all whereof the audience wondered
and said, “By Allah, this is a delectable matter and a dainty;”
but the Pirate cried aloud, “Such story pleaseth me not in any
way for ’tis heavy upon my heart!”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that the Pirate cried
out, “This tale is heavy upon my heart!” Presently the damsel
resumed her speech and said:—Walláhi! if my mother and my
father say sooth this be my sire and that be my cousin and here
standeth the King and there the Wazir and yonder are the Ra’is
and the Pirate, the comrade of the Forty Thieves whose only will
and wish was to dishonour us maidens all. Then she resumed,
addressing the King and his Minister, “These forty Mamelukes
<span class="pageno" id="Page_36">36</span>whom you see standing between your hands are the virgin girls
belonging to you.” After which she presented the twain with
sumptuous gifts and they took their maidens and with them went
their ways. Next she restored to the Ra’is his ship and freighted
it with her good and he set forth in it on his return voyage. But
as regards the Pirate she commanded her attendants to kindle for
him a furious fire and they lit it till it roared and the sparks flew
high in air, after which they pinioned him and cast him into the
flames, where his flesh was melted before his bones.<a id="r40"></a><a href="#f40" class="c012"><sup>[40]</sup></a> But as concerned
her cousin she caused the marriage tie to be tied between
him and the Wazir’s daughter and he paid her his first visit on
that same night and then she ordered her father to knit the
wedding knot with the youth on the next night and when this was
done forthwith he went in unto her. After this she committed to
him the Sultanate and he became a Sovran and Sultan in her
stead, and she bade fetch her mother to that city where her cousin
governed and where her father-in-law the Wazir was chief
Councillor of the realm. On this wise it endured for the length of
their lives, and fair to them were the term and the tide and the
age and the time, and they led of lives the joyfullest and a livelihood
of the perfectest until they were consumed by the world
and died out generation of the generation.<a id="r41"></a><a href="#f41" class="c012"><sup>[41]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_39">39</span>It is related (but Allah is All-knowing) that there was in times of
yore a man named ’Abdullah al-Karkhí and he was wont to tell
the following tale:—One day I was present in the assembly of
Al-Hajjáj the son of Yúsuf the Thakafí<a id="r43"></a><a href="#f43" class="c012"><sup>[43]</sup></a> what time he was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_40">40</span>Governor of Kúfah, and the folk around him were seated and for
awe of him prostrated and these were the Emirs and Wazirs and
the Nabobs and the Chamberlains and the Lords of the Land and
the Headmen in command and amongst whom he showed like a
rending lion. And behold, there came to him a man young in
years and ragged of raiment and of case debased and there was
none of blossom upon his cheeks and the World had changed his
cuticle and Need had altered his complexion. Presently he
salam’d and deprecated and was eloquent in his salutation to the
Governor who returned his greeting and looking at him asked,
“Who art thou, O young man, and what hast thou to say and
what is thine excuse for pushing into the assembly of the Kings
even as if, O youth, thou hadst been an invited guest?<a id="r44"></a><a href="#f44" class="c012"><sup>[44]</sup></a> So say
<span class="pageno" id="Page_41">41</span>me, who art thou and whose son art thou?” “I am the son of my
mother and my father,” answered he, and Al-Hajjaj continued,
“In what fashion hast thou come hither?”—“In my clothes.”
(¿) “Whence hast thou come?”—“From behind me.”
(¿) “Whither art thou intending?”—“Before me.” (¿) “On
what hast thou come?”—“On the ground.” (¿) “Whence art
thou, O young man?”—“I am from the city Misr.” (¿) “Art
thou from Cairo?”<a id="r45"></a><a href="#f45" class="c012"><sup>[45]</sup></a>—“Why askest thou me, O Hajjaj?”
Whereupon the Lieutenant of Kufah replied, “Verily her ground
is gold and her Nile is rare to behold and her women are a toy
for the conqueror to enjoy, and her men are nor burghers nor
Badawis.” Quoth the youth, “I am not of them,” and quoth
Al-Hajjaj, “Then whence art thou, O young man?”—“I am
from the city of Syria.” (¿) “Then art thou from the stubbornest
of places and of the feeblest of races.”<a id="r46"></a><a href="#f46" class="c012"><sup>[46]</sup></a> “Wherefore, O Hajjaj?”—“For
that it is a mixed breed I ween, nor Jew nor Nazarene.”
“I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young

therefore from a place the fulsomest and of faith the infirmest.”—“Wherefore,
O Hajjaj?” (¿) “Because flocks and herds are
their chums and they are Ajams of the Ajams from whom liberal
deed never comes, and their morals and manners none to praise
presumes and their speech is gross and weighty, and stingy are
their rich and wealthy.” “I am not of them.” “Then whence
art thou, O young man?” “I am from Mosul.” (¿) “Then art
<span class="pageno" id="Page_42">42</span>thou from the foulest and filthiest of a Catamite race, whose youth
is a scapegrace and whose old age hath wits as the wits of an
ass.” “I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young
man?” “I am from the land of Al-Yaman.” (¿) “Then art
thou from a clime other than delectable. And why so, O
Hajjaj?” (¿) “For that their noblest make womanly use of
Murd<a id="r47"></a><a href="#f47" class="c012"><sup>[47]</sup></a> or beardless boys and the meanest of them tan hides
and the lowest amongst them train baboons to dance, and others

(¿) “Then whence art thou, O young man?” “I am from Meccah.”
(¿) “Then art thou from a mine of captious carping and ignorance
and lack of wits and of sleep over-abundant, whereto Allah commissioned
a noble Prophet, and him they belied and they rejected:
so he went forth unto a folk which loved him and honoured him
and made him a conqueror despite the nose of the Meccan churls.”
“I am not of them.” (¿) “Then whence art thou, O young

longeth to cut off thy pate.”<a id="r49"></a><a href="#f49" class="c012"><sup>[49]</sup></a> Hereupon quoth the youth, “An
I knew thou couldst slay me I had not worshipped any god save
thyself,” and quoth Al-Hajjaj, “Woe to thee, and who shall stay
me from slaying thee?” “To thyself be the woe with measure
enow,” cried the youth; “He shall hinder thee from killing me
who administereth between a man and his heart,<a id="r50"></a><a href="#f50" class="c012"><sup>[50]</sup></a> and who falseth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_43">43</span>not his promise.” “’Tis He,” rejoined Al-Hajjaj, “who directeth
me to thy death;” but the Youth retorted, “Allah forfend that
He appoint thee to my slaughter; nay rather art thou commissioned
by thy Devil, and I take refuge with the Lord from
Satan the stoned.” (¿) “Whence then art thou, O young man?”
“I am from Yathrib.”<a id="r51"></a><a href="#f51" class="c012"><sup>[51]</sup></a> (¿) “And what be Yathrib?” “It is
Tayyibah.” (¿) “And what be Tayyibah?” “Al-Madinah, the
Luminate, the mine of inspiration and explanation and prohibition
and licitation,<a id="r52"></a><a href="#f52" class="c012"><sup>[52]</sup></a> and I am the seed of the Banú Ghálib<a id="r53"></a><a href="#f53" class="c012"><sup>[53]</sup></a> and the

off until the Day of Doom.” Hereupon Al-Hajjaj raged with
exceeding rage and ordered the Youth to execution; whereat rose
up against him the Lords of the realm and the headmen of the
reign and sued him by way of intercession and stretched out to
him their necks, saying, “Here are our heads before his head
and our lives before his life. By Allah, ho thou the Emir, there
is naught but that thou accept our impetration in the matter of
this Youth, for he is on no wise deserving of death.” Quoth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_44">44</span>the Governor, “Weary not yourselves for needs must I slay him;
and even were an Angel from Heaven to cry out ’Kill him not,’
I would never hearken to his cry.” Quoth the youth, “Thou
shalt be baffled<a id="r55"></a><a href="#f55" class="c012"><sup>[55]</sup></a> O Hajjaj! Who art thou that an Angel from
Heaven should cry out to thee ’Kill him not,’ for thou art of the
vilest and meanest of mankind nor hast thou power to find a path
to my death.” Cried Al-Hajjaj, “By Allah, I will not slay thee
except upon a plea I will plead against thee, and convict thee by
thy very words.” “What is that, O Hajjaj?” asked the Youth, and
answered Hajjaj, “I will now question thee, and out of thine own
mouth will I convict thee and strike off thy head.<a id="r56"></a><a href="#f56" class="c012"><sup>[56]</sup></a> Now say me,
O young man:—Whereby doth the slave draw near to Allah

alms (3), and pilgrimage (4), and Holy War upon the path of
Almighty Allah (5).” “But I draw near to the Lord with the
blood of the men who declare that Hasan and Husayn were the
sons and successors of the Apostle of Allah.<a id="r57"></a><a href="#f57" class="c012"><sup>[57]</sup></a> Furthermore, O

hath forbidden the taking of life, whose destruction is therefore
unlawful.” (¿) “Thou hast spoken sooth, O young man, but
inform me of what is incumbent on thee every day and every

quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister

“Now do thou inform me who is the most excellent of the Arabs

prayed him for mercy, when he accepted their intercession and
pardoned the offender. After which he said to him, “O young

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereupon Al-Hajjaj laughed aloud and all who were with him in
assembly; and presently he resumed, “O youth, tell me concerning
the first man who spake in verse<a id="r96"></a><a href="#f96" class="c012"><sup>[96]</sup></a> and that was our
common sire, Adam (The Peace be upon him!) what time Kábíl<a id="r97"></a><a href="#f97" class="c012"><sup>[97]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_57">57</span>slew Hábíl his brother when our forefather improvised these
lines:—</p>

      <div class="line">“Changed I see my country and all thereon; ✿ Earth is now a blackavice, ugly grown:</div>

      <div class="line">An thou, O Abel, be slain this day ✿ Thy death I bemourn with heart tornand lone.</div>
      <div class="line">Weep these eyes and ’sooth they have right to weep ✿ Their tears are as rills flowing hills adown.</div>
      <div class="line">Kábil slew Hábil—did his brother dead; ✿ Oh my woe for that lovely face, ochone!”<a id="r98"></a><a href="#f98" class="c012"><sup>[98]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereat Al-Hajjaj asked, “O, young man, what drove our ancestor
to poetry?” whereto answered the youth——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Five Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_58">58</span>replied, “He was driven to poetry by Iblis (whom Allah accurse!)
when he spake in this verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou bewailest the land and all thereon ✿ And scant was the breadth of Eden didst own,</div>
      <div class="line">Where thou wast girded by every good ✿ O’ life and in rest ever won’t to wone:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Whereupon quoth Al-Hajjaj, “O young man, inform me concerning
the first couplet of verse spoken by the Arab in praise of
munificence;” and quoth the youth, “O Hajjaj, the first Arabic
distich known to me was spoken by Hátim of Tayy, and ’twas as
follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And the guest I greet ere from me he go ✿ Before wife and weans in my weal and woe.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then cried Al-Hajjaj, “Thou hast said well and hast spoken fair,
O young man; and thy due is incumbent upon us for that thou hast
drowned us in the deeps of thy wisdom.” Presently the Lieutenant
of Kufah turning towards one of his eunuchs said, “Bring me at
this very moment a purse containing ten thousand dirhams<a id="r100"></a><a href="#f100" class="c012"><sup>[100]</sup></a> upon
a charger of red gold and a suit of the rarest of my raiment and a
blood mare the noblest steed of my steeds with a saddle of
gold and a haubergeon;<a id="r101"></a><a href="#f101" class="c012"><sup>[101]</sup></a> and a lance of full length and a handmaid
<span class="pageno" id="Page_59">59</span>the handsomest of my slave-girls.” The attendant disappeared
for a while, and presently brought all this between the
hands of Al-Hajjaj, who said, “O young man, this damsel is the
fairest of my chattels, and this be the purse on a charger of gold,
and this mare is the purest in blood of my steeds together with her
housings, so do thou take whatever thou desirest thereof, either the
mare with all upon her or the purse of gold or the concubine,”
presently saying to himself, “If the young man prefer the purse,
’twill prove that he loveth the world and I will slay him, also if he
choose the girl, he lusteth after womankind, and I will do him die:
but if he take the mare and her furniture, he will show himself the
brave of braves, and he meriteth not destruction at my hands.”
Then the youth came forward and took the mare and her appointments.
Now the damsel was standing by the young Sayyid, and
she winked at him with her eye as one saying, “Do thou choose
me and leave all the rest;” whereupon he began to improvise the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The jingling bridle on Bayard’s neck. ✿ Is dearer to me than what sign thou deign:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear when I fall into straits and fare ✿ Abroad, no comrade in thee to gain:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear when lain on my couch and long ✿ My sickness, thou prove thee nor fond nor fain:</div>
      <div class="line">I fear me that time groweth scant my good ✿ And my hand be strait thou shalt work me bane:</div>
      <div class="line">A helpmate I want shall do what do I ✿ And bear patient the pasture of barren plain.”<a id="r102"></a><a href="#f102" class="c012"><sup>[102]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently the handmaid answered his verse with the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Forfend me, Allah, from all thou say’st ✿ Though my left with my right thou shalt hew in twain</div>
      <div class="line">A husband’s honour my works shall keep ✿ And I’ll wone content with his smallest gain:</div>
      <div class="line">Didst know me well and my nature weet ✿ Thou hadst found me mate of the meekest strain.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_60">60</span>Nor all of women are like to sight ✿ Nor all of men are of similar grain.</div>
      <div class="line">The charge of a mate to the good belongs ✿ Let this oath by Allah belief obtain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hearing these words Al-Hajjaj exclaimed, “Woe to thee,
O damsel, dost thou answer him in his verse? and do thou
O young man, take the whole, and may Allah give thee no
blessing therein.”<a id="r103"></a><a href="#f103" class="c012"><sup>[103]</sup></a> Answered the young Sayyid, “Here with
them, O Hajjaj, inasmuch as thou hast given them to me, I will
not oppose the order of Allah through thee, but another time
there is no union between us twain, me and thee, as there hath
been this day.” Now the city of Al-Hajjaj had two gates—the
door of Destruction and the door of Salvation; and when the
youth asked him, “O Hajjaj, shall I go forth from this or from
that?” the Lieutenant of Kufah cried, “Issue by this outlet,”
and showed him the Gate of Safety. Then the youth took all
the presents and fared forth by the passage which had been shown
to him, and went his ways and was seen no more. Hereupon the
Grandees of the kingdom said to Al-Hajjaj, “O our lord, how
hast thou given to him these gifts and he hath on nowise thanked
thee, nor wished thee well<a id="r104"></a><a href="#f104" class="c012"><sup>[104]</sup></a> for thy favours, and yet hast thou
pointed out to him the Gate of Salvation?” Hereupon he replied,
“Verily, the youth asked direction of me, and it becometh the
director to be trustworthy and no traitor (Allah’s curse be upon
him who betrayeth!), and this youth meriteth naught save mercy
by reason of his learning.”<a id="r105"></a><a href="#f105" class="c012"><sup>[105]</sup></a></p>

  <h2 class="c006">NIGHT ADVENTURE OF HARUN AL-RASHID AND THE YOUTH MANJAB.<a id="r106"></a><a href="#f106" class="c012"><sup>[106]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_63">63</span>It is told in various relations of the folk (but Allah is All-knowing
of His secret purpose and All-powerful and All-beneficent and
All-merciful in whatso of bygone years transpired and amid
peoples of old took place) that the Caliph Hárún al-Rashíd being
straitened of breast one day summoned his Chief of the Eunuchs
and said to him, “O Masrúr!” Quoth he, “Adsum, O my
lord;” and quoth the other, “This day my breast is straitened
and I would have thee bring me somewhat to hearten my heart
and consume my care.” Replied Masrur, “O my lord, do thou go
forth to thy garden and look upon the trees and the blooms and
the rills and listen to the warblings of the fowls.” Harun replied,
“O Masrur, thou hast mentioned a matter which palleth on my
palate<a id="r107"></a><a href="#f107" class="c012"><sup>[107]</sup></a> nor may my breast be broadened by aught thou hast
commended.” Rejoined the Eunuch, “Then do thou enter thy
palace and having gathered thy handmaids before thee, let each
and every say her say whilst all are robed in the choicest of
raiment and ornaments; so shalt thou look upon them and thy
spirits shall be cheered.” The Caliph retorted, “O Masrur, we
want other than this;” whereupon quoth the slave, “O Prince of
True Believers, send after the Wazirs and thy brotherhood of
learned men and let them improvise for thee poetry and set before
<span class="pageno" id="Page_64">64</span>thee stories whereby shall thy care be solaced.” Quoth he, “O
Masrur, naught of this shall profit me.” Hereat cried the Eunuch,
“Then, O my lord, I see naught for thee save to take thy sabre
and smite the neck of thy slave: haply and peradventure this may
comfort thee and do away with thy disgust.”<a id="r108"></a><a href="#f108" class="c012"><sup>[108]</sup></a> When the King
Harun al-Rashid heard these words, he laughed aloud and said to
him, “O Masrur, go forth to the gate where haply thou shalt find
some one of my cup-companions.” Accordingly he went to the
porte in haste and there came upon one of the courtiers which was
Ali ibn Mansúr Al-Dimishkí and brought him in. The Commander
of the Faithful seeing him bade him be seated and said,
“O Ibn Mansur, I would have thee tell me a tale somewhat rare
and strange; so perchance my breast may be broadened and my
doleful dumps from me depart.” Said he, “O Prince of True
Believers, dost thou desire that I relate to thee of the things
which are past and gone or I recount a matter I espied with
my own eyes?” Al-Rashid replied, “An thou have sighted
somewhat worthy seeing relate it to us for hearing is not like
beholding.” He rejoined, “O Emir al-Muuminín, whilst I tell
thee this tale needs must thou lend me ear and mind;” and the
Caliph<a id="r109"></a><a href="#f109" class="c012"><sup>[109]</sup></a> retorted, “Out with thy story, for here am I hearkening
to thee with ears and eyes wide awake, so that my soul may
understand the whole of this say.” Hereupon Ibn Mansur related
to him</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_65">65</span>
  <h3 class="c013"><em>THE LOVES OF THE LOVERS OF BASSORAH.</em><a id="r110"></a><a href="#f110" class="c012"><sup>[110]</sup></a></h3>
</div>

<p class="c014">Now when Al-Rashid heard the tale of Ibn Mansur there fell
from him somewhat of his cark and care but he was not wholly
comforted. He spent the night in this case and when it was
morning he summoned the Wazir Ja’afar ibn Yahyá the Barmaki,
and cried to him, “O Ja’afar!” He replied, “Here am I! Allah
lengthen thy life, and make permanent thy prosperity.” The
Caliph resumed, “Verily my breast is straitened and it hath
passed through my thought that we fare forth, I and thou (and
Eunuch Masrur shall make a third), and we will promenade the
main streets of Baghdad and solace ourselves with seeing its
several places and peradventure I may espy somewhat to hearten
my heart and clear off my care and relieve me of what is with me
of straitness of breast.” Ja’afar made answer, “O Commander of
the Faithful, know that thou art Caliph and Regent and Cousin to
the Apostle of Allah and haply some of the sons of the city may
speak words that suit thee not and from that matter may result
other matter with discomfort to thy heart and annoyance to thy
mind, the offender unknowing the while that thou art walking the
streets by night. Then thou wilt command his head to be cut off
and what was meant for pleasure may end in displeasure and wrath
and wrong-doing.” Al-Rashid replied, “I swear by the rights of
my forbears and ancestors even if aught mishap to us from the
meanest of folk as is wont to happen or he speak words which
should not be spoken, that I will neither regard them nor reply
thereto, neither will I punish the aggressor, nor shall aught linger
in my heart against the addresser; but need must I pass through
<span class="pageno" id="Page_66">66</span>the Bazar this very night.” Hereupon quoth Ja’afar to the
Caliph, “O Viceregent of Allah upon earth, do thou be steadfast
of purpose and rely upon Allah!”<a id="r111"></a><a href="#f111" class="c012"><sup>[111]</sup></a> Then they arose and arousing
Masrur doffed what was upon them of outer dress and bag-trousers
and habited themselves each one of them in garments differing
from those of the city folks. Presently they sallied forth by the
private postern and walked from place to place till they came to
one of the highways of the capital and after threading its length
they arrived at a narrow street whose like was never seen about
all the horizons.<a id="r112"></a><a href="#f112" class="c012"><sup>[112]</sup></a> This they found swept and sprinkled with the
sweet northern breeze playing through it and at the head thereof
rose a mansion towering from the dust and hanging from the
necks of the clouds. Its whole length was of sixty cubits
whereas its breadth was of twenty ells; its gate was of ebony
inlaid with ivory and plated with plates of yellow brass while
athwart the doorway hung a curtain of sendal and over it was a
chandelier of gold fed with oil of ’Irákí violets which brightened
all that quarter with its light. The King Harun al-Rashid and
the Wazir and the Eunuch stood marvelling at what they saw of
these signs and at what they smelt of the scents breathing from
the clarity<a id="r113"></a><a href="#f113" class="c012"><sup>[113]</sup></a> of this palace as though they were the waftings of the
perfumed gardens of Paradise and they cast curious glances at the
abode so lofty and of base so goodly and of corners so sturdy,
whose like was never builded in those days. Presently they
noted that its entrance was poikilate with carvings manifold and
arabesques of glittering gold and over it was a line writ in
letters of lapis lazuli. So Al-Rashid took seat under the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_67">67</span>candelabrum with Ja’afar standing on his right and Masrur afoot
to his left and he exclaimed, “O Wazir, this mansion is naught
save in the utmost perfection of beauty and degree; and verily its
lord must have expended upon it wealth galore and of gold a
store; and, as its exterior is magnificent exceedingly, so would to
Heaven I knew what be its interior.” Then the Caliph cast a
glance at the upper lintel of the door whereupon he saw inscribed
in letters of golden water which glittered in the rays of the
chandelier,</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“WHOSO SPEAKETH OF WHAT CONCERNETH HIM NOT SHALL HEAR WHAT PLEASETH HIM NOT.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereupon quoth Al-Rashid, “O Ja’afar, the house-master never
wrote yonder lines save for a reason and I desire to discover what
may be his object, so let us forgather with him and ask him the
cause of this legend being inscribed in this place.” Quoth Ja’afar,
“O Prince of True Believers, yonder lines were never written save
in fear of the curtain of concealment being withdrawn.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night, and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ja’afar the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_68">68</span>Barmecide said to the King, “Verily the master of this house
never wrote yonder lines save in fear lest the curtain of concealment
be withdrawn.” Hearing this the Caliph held his peace for
a while and fell to pondering this matter then said he, “O Ja’afar,
knock at the door and ask for us a gugglet of water;” and when
the Wazir did his bidding one of the slaves called out from within
the entrance, “Who is it rappeth at our gate?” Hereupon said
Masrur to him, “O son of my uncle, open to us the door and give
us a gugglet of water for that our lord thirsteth.” The chattel
went in to his master, the young man, Manjáb hight, who owned
the mansion, and said, “O my lord, verily there be at our door
three persons who have rapped for us and who ask for a drink of
water.” The master asked, “What manner of men may they
be?” and the slave answered, “One of them sitteth under the
chandelier and another of them standeth by his side and the third
is a black slave between their hands; and all three show signs of
staidness and dignity than which naught can be more.” “Go forth
to them,” exclaimed the master, “and say to them:—My lord
inviteth you to become of his guests.” So the servile went out
and delivered the message, whereat they entered and found five
lines of inscription in different parts of the hall with a candelabrum
overhanging each and every and the whole five contained the
sentence we have before mentioned; furthermore all the lights
were hung up over the legend that the writing might be made
manifest unto whoso would read it. Accordingly Harun al-Rashid
entered and found a mansion of kingly degree<a id="r114"></a><a href="#f114" class="c012"><sup>[114]</sup></a> and of marvellous
<span class="pageno" id="Page_69">69</span>ordinance in the utmost that could be of beauty and ornament
and five black slaves and as many Eunuchs were standing in the
saloon to offer their services. Seeing this the Caliph marvelled
with extreme marvel at the house and the house-master who
greeted them in friendly guise; after which he to whom the
palace belonged sat down upon a divan and bade Al-Rashid sit
over against him and signed to Ja’afar and Masrur to take their
places in due degree,<a id="r115"></a><a href="#f115" class="c012"><sup>[115]</sup></a> whilst the negroes and the eunuchs stood
expecting their commands for suit and service. Presently was
brought to them a huge waxen taper which lighted up the whole
of the hall and the young house-master accosted the King and
said to him, “Well come and welcome and fair welcome to our
guests who to us are the most esteemed of folk and may Allah
honour their places!” Hereupon he began to repeat the following
couplets:<a id="r116"></a><a href="#f116" class="c012"><sup>[116]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“If the house knew who visits it, it would indeed rejoice And stoop to kiss the happy place whereon her feet have stood;</div>
      <div class="line">And in the voice with which the case, though mute, yet speaks, Exclaim, ’Wellcome and many a welcome to the generous, and the good.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently Manjab the master of the house bade bring for his guests
meats and viands meet for the great, of all kinds and of every
colour, so they obeyed his orders and when they had eaten their
sufficiency they were served with confections perfumed with rosewater
wondrous fine. Hereupon quoth the youth to Al-Rashid
and those with him, “Almighty Allah make it pleasant to you<a id="r117"></a><a href="#f117" class="c012"><sup>[117]</sup></a>
and blame us not and accept our excuses for what Allah hath
made easy to us at such time of night, and there is no doubt but
that this be a fortunate day when ye made act of presence before
us.” They thanked him and Al-Rashid’s breast was broadened
and his heart was heartened and there fell from him all that whilom
<span class="pageno" id="Page_70">70</span>irked him. Then the youth shifted them from that place to
another room which was the women’s apartment; and here he
seated them upon the highest Divan and bade serve to them a
platter containing fruits of all descriptions and ordered his servants
to bring roast meats and fried meats and when this was done they
set before them the service of wine. Anon appeared four troops
of singers with their instruments of music and each was composed
of five handmaids, so the whole numbered a score and these when
they appeared before the master kissed ground between his hands
and sat down each one in her own degree. Then amongst them
the cups went about and all sorrow was put to rout and the birds
of joyance flapped their wings. This continued for an hour of
time whilst the guests sat listening to the performers on the lute
and other instruments and after there came forward five damsels
other than the first twenty and formed a second and separate set
and they showed their art of singing in wondrous mode even as
was done by the first troop. Presently on like guise came set after
set till the whole twenty had performed and as Al-Rashid heard
their strains he shook with pleasure——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_71">71</span>of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that when Al-Rashid
heard their strains, he shook with pleasure and wonder and joyance
and enjoyment until he rent his robes<a id="r118"></a><a href="#f118" class="c012"><sup>[118]</sup></a> and the house-master
beholding this said to him, “O our lord, be the heart of thine
enemies thus rended asunder!” Now there was amongst the
handmaids a songstress who began to sing and to improvise these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My world goes strait when thou art a-gone ✿ And when fled from my ken in my heart dost wone<a id="r119"></a><a href="#f119" class="c012"><sup>[119]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">And I love my love with a love as fond ✿ As Jacob him who in pit was thrown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereupon Ja’afar was delighted with exceeding delight and rent
his raiment even as the Caliph had done, but when the house-master
saw this from him he ordered for the twain a suit of
clothes that befitted them and bade strip them of the rended
garments and clothed them in the new. Presently the young
man said, “O my lords, your time is gleesome and Allah make it
to you gladsome and broaden your hearts and from you fend
everything loathsome and lasting to you be honour and all that
is blithesome.” Hereupon he ordered another damsel to chaunt
that was with her and when Masrur the Eunuch heard it he tare
his garment as had been done by Al-Rashid and the Wazir, when
the house-master bade bring for him a suit that besitted him and
they donned it after doffing the torn clothes. Then the youth
ordered a handmaid of the fourth set who sang a tune and spake
these couplets:—</p>

<p class="c000">Hearing this Manjab the master of the house shrieked out a
mighty loud shriek and tare his upper dress and fell aswoon to the
ground, and as Al-Rashid looked upon him (and he bestrown in
his fainting fit) he beheld upon his sides the stripes of scourging
with rods and palm-sticks. At this sight he was surprised and
said, “O Ja’afar, verily I marvel at this youth and his generosity
and munificence and fine manners, especially when I look upon
that which hath befallen him of beating and bastinadoing, and in
good sooth this is a wondrous matter.” Quoth the other, “O our
lord, haply someone hath harmed him in much money and his enemy
took flight and the owner of the property administered to him this
beating<a id="r122"></a><a href="#f122" class="c012"><sup>[122]</sup></a> or peradventure someone lied concerning him, and he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_73">73</span>fell into the hands of the rulers and the Sultan bade bastinado
him, or again perchance his tongue tripped and his fate was fulfilled
to him.” Quoth Al-Rashid, “O Ja’afar, this youth be not
in the conditions thou hast mentioned to me,” and, replied the
other, “Sooth thou hast said, O our lord; by cause that indeed
this young man, when we asked him for a gugglet of water invited
us into his place and honoured us with all this honour and
heartened our hearts and this was of the stress of his generosity
and his abundant goodness.” Al-Rashid continued to converse
with his Wazir while the young man did not recover from his
swoon for a while of time, when another maiden of the maidens
spoke out reciting these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“He adorns the branch of his tribal-tree, ✿ Loves the fawn his song as his sight she see;</div>
      <div class="line">And beauty shines in his every limb ✿ While in every heart he must stablished be.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereat the young man came to himself and shrieked a mighty
loud shriek more violent than the first and put forth his hand to
his garment and rent it in rags and fell swooning a second time,
when his sides were bared more fully than before until the whole
of his back appeared and Al-Rashid was straitened thereby as to
his breast and his patience made protest, and he cried, “O Ja’afar,
there is no help but that I ask concerning the wheals of this
bastinadoing.” And as they talked over the matter of the youth
behold, he came to his senses and his slaves brought him a fresh
suit and caused him don it, whereupon Al-Rashid came forward
and said, “O young man, thou hast honoured us and favoured us
and entreated us with such kindness as other than thyself could
never do nor can any requite us with the like; withal there
<span class="pageno" id="Page_74">74</span>remaineth a somewhat in my heart”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Rashid
said to the youth, the master of the house, “Withal there remaineth
a somewhat in my heart which if I manifest not to thee will abide
there to my displeasure in my thought; and, albeit there is nothing
to equal that thou hast done with us, still I desire of thee and of
the excellence of thy kindness a fulfilling of thy favour.” Said
the youth, “What dost thou wish of me, ho thou the lord?”
and said the Caliph, “I would have thee inform me concerning
the scars upon thy sides and let me know for what cause they be
there.” Now when the young man heard these words he bowed
his brow groundwards and wept awhile, then he wiped his face and
raised his head and asked, “What hath urged you to this? But
the fault is from me and I merit a penalty even greater. O sons
of impurity, say me have you not read the lines written over the
doors of my house that here you are speaking of what concerneth
you not and so right soon shall ye hear what pleaseth you not?
However, had ye never entered my house you would not have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_75">75</span>known of my case and my shame,<a id="r123"></a><a href="#f123" class="c012"><sup>[123]</sup></a> and withal sooth spoke he who
said amongst his many sayings:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“We sowed kindness-seed but they wrought us wrong ✿ Which is caitiff-work and a traitor-deed.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Resumed the young man, “O vilest of folk, you asked of me a
gugglet of water, and I brought you into my house and honoured
and welcomed you and you ate of my victual and my salt, after
which I led you into my Harem with the fancy that ye were honest
men and behold you are no men. Woe to you, what may ye be?”
On this wise he continued to chide and revile them unknowing
that the Caliph Harun al-Rashid stood before him, and presently
the Prince of True Believers made reply, “We be folk of
Bassorah.” “Truth you have spoken,” cried the other, “nothing
cometh from Bassorah save the meanest of men and the weakest
of wits but now rise up, O ye dung<a id="r124"></a><a href="#f124" class="c012"><sup>[124]</sup></a> of mankind, O ye foulest of
folk, and go forth from us and may Allah curse him who speaketh
of whatso concerneth him not.” All this and Ja’afar and Masrur
rose to their feet for shame of the youth and of what they had
heard from him of ill language and they went from beside him.
But Al-Rashid’s temper was ruffled and his jugulars swelled and
the Hashimi vein stood out between his eyes and he cried, “Woe
to thee, O Ja’afar! go this moment to Such-an-one the Wali and
bid him muster his men of whom each one must have in hand an
implement of iron, and let him repair to the mansion of this youth
and raze it till it return to be level with the ground, nor let
the morning dawn and show a trace thereof upon the face of
earth.” Quoth Ja’afar to Al-Rashid, “O Prince of True Believers,
from the very first we feared for all this, and did we not make
condition on the subject? However, O our lord, the good man is
not ruined by the good man and this work is not righteous; nay,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_76">76</span>’tis wholly unright and one of the sages hath said:—The mild in
mind is not known save in the hour of wrath. But, O Prince of
faithful men and O Caliph of the Lord who the worlds dost vicereign,
thou swarest an oath that although the vilest of men should
ill-speak thee yet wouldest thou not requite him with evil, nor
return him aught of reply nor keep aught of rancour in thy heart
for his unmannerly address. Moreover, O our lord, the youth hath
no default at all and the offence is from us, for that he forbade
and forefended us and wrote up in many a place the warning
words, Whoso speaketh of what concerneth him not, shall hear
what pleaseth him not. Therefore he unmeriteth the pain of
death. Now what we had better do in this case is as follows:—Send
thou for the Wali and bid him bring the youth and when he
is present between thy hands, encounter him with kindness that his
fear may find rest and his affright be arrested after which he shall
inform thee of whatso befel him.” Cried Al-Rashid, “This is the
right rede and Allah requite thee with weal, O Ja’afar. ’Tis the
like of thee should be Wazir of the Councillors and Counseller of
the Kings.” Hereupon Harun al-Rashid returned to his palace in
company with Masrur the eunuch, and they entered the aforesaid
private door whereby they had gone forth, nor was any aware of
them. But when Ja’afar reached his abode he took thought in his
mind as to how he should act and how he should send the Wali
to the young man and bring him into the presence; and presently
he retraced his way afoot and going to the Chief of Police
acquainted him with the matter of the youth and carefully
described his house and said to him, “Needs must thou bring him
to us in the front of morning, but do thou be courteous in thy
dealing and show him comradeship and startle him not nor cause
him aught of fear.” After this Ja’afar dismissed the Wali and
returned to his own quarters. And when the morning morrowed
the Chief of Police having chosen him as escort a single Mameluke,
made for the house of the youth, and when he had reached it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_77">77</span>knocked at the door, upon which the owner came out to him and
the Wali knew him by the description wherewith Ja’afar had
described him, so he bade him accompany him. Hereat the heart
of the young man fluttered.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Thirty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth’s
heart fluttered when the Chief of Police summoned him to go in
his company and he was smitten by sore fear; but the Wali said
to him, “No harm shall befal thee: obey the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful.” Now when he heard these words
Manjab was terrified with sorer alarm and affright, so by leave of
the Wali he entered his house and farewelled his family and
familiars after which he fared forth with the Chief of Police saying,
“Hearkening and obedience to Allah and to the Prince of True
Believers.” Then he mounted his beast and the two rode together
until they reached the Palace of the Caliph Harun al-Rashid where
they craved admission to the presence; and, when leave was
granted, the youth went in and standing between the hands of
Harun he encouraged his intent and made his tongue eloquent
and kissed ground between the royal hands and sat respectfully
<span class="pageno" id="Page_78">78</span>before him. Then he began with a tongue that was free of fear
and showed naught of apprehension and spake the following
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Hail to this place for such be honoured stead ✿ Of God’s viceregent known to all and some:</div>
      <div class="line">Palace of Al-Rashid, our lord, which aye ✿ Excelleth Heaven higher still become:</div>
      <div class="line">I haste that may I write what should be writ ✿ And eloquent the writ albe ’tis dumb.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">After which he said, “The peace be upon thee, O Commander
of the Faithful, and Allah prolong thy life and gladden unto thee
what He hath given.” Hereat Al-Rashid raised his head, and
returning his greeting signed to the Wazir Ja’afar who, as was his
wont, stood by his side, and the Minister taking the youth’s hand,
led him up to Al-Rashid and seated him beside him. “Draw
near me,” said Harun al-Rashid, and the young man did accordingly
until he was close to the King who thus addressed him, “O young
man, what is thy name?” The other replied, “I am Manjab hight
wherefrom hath been cut off all cause of delight and who for a year
hath suffered parlous plight.” “O Manjab,” quoth the Caliph,
“favour for favour and the beginner is the better, and ill for ill
and the first is the worst, and whoso seed of good soweth shall reap
it, and whoso planteth evil shall harvest it, and know thou,
O Manjab, that yesterday we were thy guests, and that in thee was
no default, but we transgressed against thee when thou honouredst
us with most high honour, and favouredst us with the highmost
favours. I desire, however, that thou relate to me the cause of
the blows upon thy body and no harm shall befal thee.” The
youth replied, “O Prince of True Believers, an thou desire to hear
my tale order me a cushion to be placed on my right hand, and
deign lend unto me three things, to wit, thine ears and thine eyes
and thy heart, for verily my adventure is wondrous, and were it
graven with needle-gravers on the eye-corners it would be a warning
to whoso would be warned and a matter of thought to whoso
<span class="pageno" id="Page_79">79</span>would think. Learn, O Commander of the Faithful, that my father
was a jeweller man, a connoisseur in gems, who owned no son save
myself; but when I had increased in age and had grown in stature
and Allah had given me comeliness and perfection and beauty and
brilliancy and plenty and good fortune, and my sire had brought
me up with the best of education, Allah vouchsafed to him a
daughter. Now as I had reached the age of twenty years my
parent departed to the ruth of Allah Almighty, bequeathing to me
a thousand thousand dinars and fiefs and tenements and landed
estates, so I let perform for him a sufficiency of mortuary-ceremonies
after committing him to mother earth, and caused read
twenty perfections of the Koran, and bestowed for him in alms a
mighty matter. I abode a-mourning for him a month full told, and
when the term was ended my heart turned to diversion and disport
and eating and drinking, and I made presents and gave away and
doled charities of that my property, and I bought other tenements
at the highest price. After this I purchased me singing damsels
of the greatest value, and whosoever of my friends and companions
was pleased with a musician girl I would hand her over to him
without price; nay, I would present her in free gift, and if any saw
aught of my belongings which pleased him and said to me, “This
is nice,” I would bestow it upon him without money-claim.
Furthermore I robed all my familiars in honourable robes, and
honoured them with the highest honour, lavishing all that was by
me, and whatever my hand possessed, ever quoting these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Rise, O comrade of cup, and to joy incline; ✿ I’ve no patience, O brother, from pressing of wine:</div>
      <div class="line">See’st not how night with her hosts be fled ✿ Routed, and morn doth her troops align?</div>
      <div class="line">How with Nadd and ambergris, rarest scents, ✿ Rose laughs and smiles on us Eglantine?</div>
      <div class="line">This, my lord, is joy, this is pure delight, ✿ Not standing at doors which the books confine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">But when my mother, O Commander of the Faithful, espied these
<span class="pageno" id="Page_80">80</span>doings she reproached me, yet would I not be reproved. Then she
saw that my wealth would be wasted, so she divided it between me
and her, to each one half, a moiety for herself and her daughter,
and the rest for myself. And presently she left me carrying away
her good and separated herself from me, abiding afar and leaving
me to enjoy my frivolity and intoxication. I ceased not eating
and drinking and diversion and disport, and enjoying the all-conquering
faces of the beautiful,<a id="r125"></a><a href="#f125" class="c012"><sup>[125]</sup></a> until the days smote me with their
shafts, and all my wealth fell away from me and naught remained
to me either above me or below me, and I ceased to be master of
aught. Then my condition waxed strait, and as nothing was left
to me at home I sold the pots and pans until I lacked even a
sleeping-mat, and I used to patch my skirt with my sleeve. And
naught profited me, neither friend nor familiar nor lover, nor
remained there any one of them to feed me with a loaf of bread;
so my case became hard and the folk entreated me evilly, nor was
there one of my comrades or compeers who would take thought
for me; nay more, when I met any of them on the road or at
the receptions they would turn away their faces from me. So at
last I took to pulling up the slabs<a id="r126"></a><a href="#f126" class="c012"><sup>[126]</sup></a> of the house floor and selling
them by way of a livelihood, and one day as I did on this wise, lo and
behold! there opened in the floor a large vault whereinto I descended.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable.” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night an the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_81">81</span>King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Fortieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
Manjab continued his tale to Al-Rashid in these words. So I
descended into the vault, O Commander of the Faithful, and
I found there three boxes each containing five bags and every bag
held five thousand gold pieces. I carried forth the whole of them
and set them in an apartment of the apartments and returned the
flag of the floor to its place. Then I pondered what my brethren
and companions had done with me, after which, O Prince of True
Believers, I bought handsome clothes and made my person as it
was before; and as soon as those men who were with me of yore and
upon whom I had spent my substance in gifts and presents beheld
me on such wise they flocked around me again. I accepted of them
for a device which I purposed carrying out and took patience with
them for a whole month whilst they came to visit me every day.
But when it was the thirty-first day I summoned the Kazi and
his assessors whom I concealed in a private place and bade write
a bond and an acceptance for everything they might hear from my
familiars and friends. After this I spread a feast and assembled
all my associates; and when we had eaten and drunken and made
merry, I drew them on to talk and to each and every whom I had
gifted with a present I said, “Allah upon thee, O Such-an-one,
did I not donate to thee so-and-so without taking any return from
thee?” And they replied “Yes, thou gavest it to me for naught.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_82">82</span>I continued, O Prince of True Believers, to address each and all
after this fashion whilst the Kazi and witnesses wrote down against
them everything they heard from them and documented every word
until not one of my friends remained without confession. Then,
O Commander of the Faithful, I rose to my feet without delay and
ere anyone could leave the assembly I brought out the Kazi and
his assessors and showed them the writ in the name of everyone,
specifying whatso he had received from the youth Manjab. After
this manner I redeemed all they had taken from me and my hand
was again in possession thereof, and I waxed sound of frame and
my good case returned to me as it had been. Now one day of
the days I took thought in my mind, O Prince of True Believers,
that I could open the shop of my sire and I would sit in it as my
parent was wont to do, selling and buying in sumptuous Hindi
cloths and jewelry and precious metals. Accordingly I repaired
to the place, which I found fast locked and the spider had pitched
her web-tent about it; so I hired a man to wipe it and sweep it
clean of all that was therein. And when the Bazar folk and the
merchants and the masters of shops saw me they rejoiced in me
and came to congratulate me saying, “Praise be to Allah who
opened not the store save for the owner thereof in succession to
his sire.” Then I took of merchandise a mighty matter and my
shop became one whose like was not to be looked upon throughout
the market-street, and amongst the goods I laid in were
carnelians of Al-Yaman; after which I seated me upon my shop-board
that very day and sold and bought and took and gave, and
I ceased not to be after such wise for nine days. Now when
it was the tenth day I entered the Hammam and came out after
donning a dress which was worth one thousand gold pieces, and my
beauty was increased and my colour waxed sheeny-bright and my
youth looked as though it had been redoubled, and I was not such
but that the women were like to throw themselves upon me. However,
when I returned from the Baths and sat in my store for an hour
<span class="pageno" id="Page_83">83</span>or so behold, I heard a shout that came from the depths of the Bazar
and heard one saying, “Have patience,”<a id="r127"></a><a href="#f127" class="c012"><sup>[127]</sup></a> when suddenly I looked
up and saw a stare-coloured mule whereon was a saddle of gold
dubbed with pearls and gems, and upon it an old woman was
riding accompanied by three pages. She ceased not going till she
stood at my shop-door where she drew rein and her servants
halted with her. Then she salam’d to me and said, “How long
is’t since thou hast opened this store?” and said I, “This day is
the full tenth.” Quoth she, “Allah have ruth upon the owner of
this shop, for he was indeed a merchant.” Quoth I, “He was my
parent,” and replied she, “Thou art Manjab named and as uniter
of thy friends enfamed.” Said I, “Yes!” whereat she smiled and
questioned me, “And how is thy sister, and what is the condition
of thy mother, and what is the state of thy neighbours?” “They
are all well,” said I, when said she, “O my son, O Manjab, thou
hast grown up and reached man’s estate.” Rejoined I, “Whoso
liveth groweth up;” and she continued, “Say me hast thou a
necklace of gems which is pleasing to the sight?” I responded,
“With me in the shop are many necklaces but I have better at
home and I will bring them for thee betimes to-morrow if it be
the will of Almighty Allah.” When she heard these my words she
returned by the way she came and her pages walked by her side;
and at the end of the day I went to my mother and informed her
of the adventure how it was with the old woman and she said,
“O my son, O Manjab, verily that ancient dame is a confidential
nurse and she conferreth benefits upon the folk amongst whom
was thy sire before thee: therefore do thou be urgent in bringing
about her business nor do thou forgo thine appointment with her.”
The old woman disappeared for a day; but on the next she
returned in her wonted state and when she came to my shop she
said, “O Manjab, arise and mount thy mule, in weal and good
<span class="pageno" id="Page_84">84</span>health!” So I left my store and mounted my she-mule—And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you in the coming night an the
Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night,
and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-second Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
Manjab said to the Prince of True Believers:—So I mounted
my she-mule and I went with the old woman until I came to a
mansion built of stone and wide of gates; so we dismounted, I and
she, and entered the door, I following after her until we came to
the great hall. There I found, O Prince of True Believers, carpets
of fine silk and embroidered hangings and mattresses of gold-cloth
and vases of the same kind all golden and fine brocades and jars
of porcelain and shelves of crystal; in fine I saw things which I
may not describe to thee, O Commander of the Faithful. And at
the side of the mansion within were four bench-seats of yellow
brass, plain and without carving and the old woman seated me
upon the highest mattress and she pointed out to me a porch
where stood pourtrayed all manner birds and beasts, and hills
and channels were limned. Now as I cast my eye over these
paintings suddenly a young lady accosted us speaking with a
delicate voice demure and words that the sick and sorry would
<span class="pageno" id="Page_85">85</span>cure and she was behind a hanging and saying, “Whoso hath let
down this curtain let him receive one hundred stripes.” Then she
bade withdraw it and they removed it and behold, I felt as though
the lightning were gleaming and glittering and it took away my
sight until my head was near striking the ground, for there stood
before me a young lady of lance-like stature and a face like the
morning bright as though she were a chandelier a-hanging amid
the cressets. She was dressed in sumptuous raiment and was even
as said of her the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“To us she bent whenas Night hung her veil ✿ And nigh went she my sense to turn from right;</div>
      <div class="line">And rang her anklets and her necklace chimed ✿ With dainty music to my tearful plight.</div>
      <div class="line">Showèd me that her face a four-fold charm, ✿ Water and fire and pitch and lamping light.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, O Commander of the Faithful, she cried out to the slave
girls, “Woe to you, where is the Nurse,” and when she was fetched
between her hands she asked her, “Hast thou brought the
jeweller;” and the other answered, “Yea, verily, O lady of loveliness,
and here he is sitting like the full moon when it easteth.”
The young lady cried, “O old woman, is this he or is it his servant?”<a id="r128"></a><a href="#f128" class="c012"><sup>[128]</sup></a>
Whereto she replied, “No, ’tis he himself, O lady of loveliness.”
Quoth the other, “By the life of my youth,<a id="r129"></a><a href="#f129" class="c012"><sup>[129]</sup></a> thou deservest
naught for this<a id="r130"></a><a href="#f130" class="c012"><sup>[130]</sup></a> save whatso thou fanciest not and thou hast
<span class="pageno" id="Page_86">86</span>raised me from before my food<a id="r131"></a><a href="#f131" class="c012"><sup>[131]</sup></a> while yet I fancied that he merited
rising up to him.” Then she considered me and cried, “Am I then
in this fashion become<a id="r132"></a><a href="#f132" class="c012"><sup>[132]</sup></a> a bundle of dirty clothes all of poverty,
and say me now, hast thou not even washed thy face?” But I, O
Prince of True Believers, was still as I came forth from the Hammam
and my countenance was shining like unto lightning. Hereat I
made myself exceeding small and it mortified me to hear how she
had found fault with my face and befouled my dress, scorning me
till I became between her hands smaller than the very smallest.
Then she fixed her sight upon me and she said to me, “Thou art
Manjab hight, thou dogs’ trysting-site or gatherer of friends as
saith other wight, but by Allah how far be familiars and friends from
thy sight, O thou Manjab hight! Now, however, do thou look
upon me, O Jeweller man, the while I eat and when my meal shall
end there will be talk.” Hereupon, O Commander of the Faithful,
they brought her a crystal platter in a golden basin and therein
were the thighs of fowls; so she took seat before me and fell to
eating without shyness or difficulty as though in her presence I
were other than a son of Adam. And I stood looking at her
and whenever she raised her wrist to take up a morsel, the dimple<a id="r133"></a><a href="#f133" class="c012"><sup>[133]</sup></a>
became manifest from without, and upon the skin was a tattoo of
green colour and about it jewelled ornaments<a id="r134"></a><a href="#f134" class="c012"><sup>[134]</sup></a> and armlets of red
<span class="pageno" id="Page_87">87</span>gold and a pink dye appeared upon the whiteness of her hand: so
glory be to Him who created her and she was naught but a
seduction to whoso espied her and blessed be Allah the best of
Creators. May the Almighty have ruth upon the poet who said
concerning the beauty of his lover these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Rise and pass me the wine, O thou son of Mansúr; ✿ And for stopping it hope not my pardon forsure:</div>
      <div class="line">Let it come by the hand of a fair white maid ✿ As though she had fared from the Heav’n of the Húr:</div>
      <div class="line">When we see the figure her wrist adorns ✿ ’Tis a musk grain lying on limestone pure.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, O Prince of True Believers, she fell to conversing with me
hending in hand a broidered kerchief wherewith whenever she had
eaten a morsel she wiped her lips and when her sleeve fell from
off her wrist she tucked it up even as the poet said of such:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“She hideth her face from the folk, ✿ With a wrist whereon Ottars abound;</div>
      <div class="line">And to eye of watcher it seems ✿ Gold shaft on Moon’s silvern round.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when she had eaten, O Commander of the Faithful, I gazed
at her face and she cried, “O ye women, behold how Manjab
looketh upon me and I am eating till my nature cry enough;”
presently adding, “O Manjab, what calamity hath befallen thee
that thou comest not forward and eatest not of this food?” So I
drew anigh and ate with her, but I was dazed of my wits and sore
amazed at her ways.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night, an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating that Manjab
continued to the Caliph:—Verily I came forward and ate with
her, but I was so dazed of my wits and so sore amazed at her
beauty and loveliness that as I took up a mouthful to carry it to
my mouth behold, I would carry it to my eyes in consequence of
what befel me from seeing that was in this young lady. And
presently she fell to laughing at me and inclining towards me in
her haughtiness and in beauty’s pride, saying at the same time,
“By Allah, indeed this man is a maniac and a Bahlúl:<a id="r135"></a><a href="#f135" class="c012"><sup>[135]</sup></a> where is
thy mouth and how far from thine eye?” So said I, “By Allah,
O lady of loveliness, I am nor a madman nor a Bahlúl, but whilst
looking at thy beauty my wits have fled and I am in condition of
unknowing how I ate.” Then she asked me, “Do I please thee,
O Manjab?” and I answered her “Yes! Walláhi, O my lady,
indeed thou dost.” Quoth she, “What should be the penalty of
him who owning me and my white beauties<a id="r136"></a><a href="#f136" class="c012"><sup>[136]</sup></a> shall then forsake me
to take other than myself?” and quoth I, “His award should be a
thousand stripes upon his right side and as many upon his left ribs,
together with the cutting off of his tongue and his two hands and
the plucking out of either eye.” She cried, “Wilt thou marry me
upon this condition?” and I replied, “O my lady, dost thou mock
and laugh at me?” Said she, “No, by Allah, my word is naught
save a true word;” and said I, “I am satisfied and I accept this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_89">89</span>compact; however do thou make haste and delay not.” But
when she looked at me and heard mine intent regarding the
marriage she shook with joy and pride and she inclined towards
me as she sat before me and my senses were like to take flight.
Then she rose up and left me for an hour and came back dressed
in sumptuous garments and fairer than before, and perfumes reeked
from her sides as she walked between four handmaidens like unto
the refulgent moon. But I, when I looked upon her in this condition,
cried out with a loud outcry and fell fainting to the ground
for what befel me from her beauty and perfection: and she had
no design therein, O Commander of the Faithful, save her favour
for me. When I came to myself she said, “O Manjab, what dost
thou say of my beauty and comeliness?” and I replied, “By
Allah, O lady of loveliness, there is none in this time can be thy
peer.” Then quoth she, “An I please thee thou wilt be content
with these conditions?” whereto quoth I, “Content! <span class="sc">Content!!</span>
CONTENT!!!” Thereupon she bade summon the Kazi and the
assessors who came without stay or delay and she said to the Judge
“Do thou listen to the condition of this marriage and write from
his word of mouth a bond on oath and under penalty for breaking
it, to the effect that if he betray me and mate with other or by
way of right or of unright, I will smite him a thousand stripes on
his right side and as many on his left ribs and I will cut off his
tongue and his two hands and I will pluck out his either eye.”
Said the Kazi to me, “Shall we bear witness against thee with
this condition?” and when I answered “Yes,” he wrote out, O
Commander of the Faithful, his testimony together with the
penalty, while I hardly believed in all this. Presently, she brought
out a tray, whereupon were a thousand miskals of gold and a
thousand dirhams of silver which she scattered among the Kazi
and witnesses; so they took them and went their ways having
duly tied the marriage-knot and indited the penalty thereto
attached. Then they served up food and we ate and drank and I
<span class="pageno" id="Page_90">90</span>lay with her that night in the pleasantest of nighting and the gladsomest
of living and I only desired that morning would never
appear for the stress of what befel me of joyance and delight;
and, verily, I never saw and never heard and never knew any
that was the like of her. So I abode with her, O Prince of True
Believers, for seven days which passed away as one watch,<a id="r137"></a><a href="#f137" class="c012"><sup>[137]</sup></a> and on
the eighth she said to me, “O thou Manjab named and for friend
of friends enfamed, do thou take this purse wherein are a thousand
dinars and buy with it merchandise of necklaces and gems and fine
clothes wherewith to beautify thy shop and other things that befit
thee; for ’tis my will that thou become the greatest of men in the
Bazar and that none therein shall boast of more good than thyself.
Moreover ’tis my wish, O Manjab, that thou fare to thy store at early
dawn and return to me about noon-tide, lest my breast be straitened
by thine absence.” Replied I, “Hearkening and obedience;” but,
O Commander of the Faithful, it was mine intent and desire never to
fare forth from her, or by night or by day, from the stress of what
befel me of enjoyment with my bride. Now she was wont every
hour to go don a dress other than that which was upon her, and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_91">91</span>when I saw her in that condition I could not contain my passion,
so I would arise and fulfil my need of her and she would do likewise.
Also, as soon as morn appeared I would repair to my shop
and open it and take seat therein until midday, at which time my
mule would be brought me to ride homewards when she would
meet me alone at the threshold whereupon opened the door of her
apartment. And I would throw my arms round her neck as soon as
she appeared to me till she and I entered the Harem where I had
no patience from her but was fain to enjoy my desire. After this
she would cry to her women and bid them bring us dinner whereof
I ate with her, and in due time she would arise and command
her slave-girls to clean the Hammam and perfume it with pastiles
of lign-aloes and ambergris adding a sufficiency of rosewater.
Then we would enter it, I and she, and doff our dresses when I
again lost patience until I had my will of her twice or three
times.<a id="r138"></a><a href="#f138" class="c012"><sup>[138]</sup></a> Anon we would wash and wipe ourselves with apron
napkins of thick silk and drying towels of palm-fibre, after which
she would cry aloud to the women who, coming to us at her call,
would bring sherberts and we would drink, I and she, until mid-afternoon.
Then I would mount my she-mule and return to my
store and as evening fell I would order the slave to padlock the
door and I would return to my house. Now I abode in such case
for ten months, but it fortuned one day of the days that, as I was
sitting upon my shop-board, suddenly I saw a Badawi woman
bestriding a she-dromedary and she was marked with a Burka’<a id="r139"></a><a href="#f139" class="c012"><sup>[139]</sup></a> of
brocade and her eyes danced under her face-veil as though they
were the wantoning eyes of a gazelle. When I looked upon her, O
<span class="pageno" id="Page_92">92</span>Commander of the Faithful, I was perplexed as to my affair.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was
the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth
Manjab to the Caliph:—O Prince of True Believers, when I
beheld the eyes of the Badawi woman under her Burka’ which
were like those of a gazelle they tempted my passions hereto and
I forgot my oath and its penalty and the Kazi and witnesses.
Then she approached me and said, “Allah give thee long life, O
Chief of the Arabs;” and said I, “To thee too, O most seemly of
semblance!” Cried she, “O comely of countenance, say me,
hast thou a necklace fine enough for the like of me;” whereto I
rejoined, “Yes.” Then I arose and brought out one to her, but
she seeing it said, “Hast thou naught better than this?” So I
displayed to her, O Commander of the Faithful, all the necklaces
I had by me in the shop but, none of them pleasing her, I said,
“In all the stores there is naught finer than these.” Then, O
Prince of True Believers, she brought out to me from off her neck
a carcanet and said, “I want one such;” and, as I looked upon it,
I knew that there was nothing like it in my store, and that all I
had by me of collars and jewels and other goods were not worth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_93">93</span>a single grain of that carcanet. So I said to her, “O Winsome of
Eyes, this is a thing whereto none of this time can avail save it be
with the Commander of the Faithful or with his Wazir Ja’afar bin
Yahyá the Barmaki.” Quoth she, “Wilt thou buy it of me?”
and quoth I, “I have no power to its price,” when she exclaimed,
“I require no payment for this necklace, and I want from thee
nothing save a kiss upon thy cheek.” Then said I, “O Lady of
loveliness, bussing without treading I trow is like a bowyer
sans a bow,” and she replied, “Whoso kisseth surely treadeth.”
Then, O Prince of True Believers, she sprang from off her
dromedary and seated herself beside me within my store, so I
arose with her and went into the inner room, she following me
(albeit I expected not this from her), and when we were safely
inside she clasped me to her bosom and encountered me with her
breasts never withal withdrawing her veil from her face. Hereat
I lost all power over my senses and when I felt her strain me to
her bosom I also strained her to mine, and fulfilled of her my
desire after the fairest fashion. And when this was done she
sprang to her feet even as springeth the lion from his lair, and
flying to the door of the shop swiftlier than a bird and leaving the
necklace with me, she mounted her dromedary and went her
ways. I imagined, O Prince of True Believers, that she would never
return to me at all; so my heart rejoiced in the necklace which
she had left and I was of that fancy and opinion anent the matter
and manner of her going, when suddenly my pages brought me
the she-mule, and said to me, “O our lord, rise up and fare to
the house, for that our lady hath required thee at this very hour
and she hath caused dinner to be served and sore we fear lest
it wax cold.” Therefore, O Commander of the Faithful, I found
it impossible to bathe<a id="r140"></a><a href="#f140" class="c012"><sup>[140]</sup></a> by reason of the pages which were
<span class="pageno" id="Page_94">94</span>standing with the mule at the door of my shop; so I mounted
and rode home. I entered my house according to my usual habit
when my wife met me and said to me “O my dearling, my
heart hath been occupied with thee this day, for thou has tarried
away from me so long a time and contrary to thy custom is
delaying on such a day as this.” Said I, “This morning the
Bazar was crowded exceedingly and all the merchants were
sitting in their shops, nor was it possible for me to rise from my
store whilst the market was so warm.” Quoth she, “O my
dearling and coolth of mine eyes, I was at this moment sitting
and reading in the Sublime Volume when there befel me a doubt
concerning a word in the chapter ’Yá Sín’<a id="r141"></a><a href="#f141" class="c012"><sup>[141]</sup></a> and I desire that
thou certify it to me that I may learn it by heart from thee.”
Quoth I, “O lady of loveliness, I am unable to touch The Book
much less may I read the Koran;” and quoth she, “What is the
cause of that?” Replied I, “I was sleeping at the side of my shop
when I had a polluting dream;” and she rejoined, “An this thy
speech be sooth-fast thy bag-trowsers must be fouled, so draw
them off that I may see to their washing.” I retorted, “Indeed
my trowsers are not bewrayed because I doffed them before lying
down to sleep.” Now when she heard these my words, O Commander
of the Faithful, she said to a slave of my slaves whose
name was Rayhán, “O man, go and open the shop and bring the
kerchief that is therein.”<a id="r142"></a><a href="#f142" class="c012"><sup>[142]</sup></a> Then said I, “O lady of lovelings, I
presented it in alms-gift to an old woman who was naked of head
and her condition pained me and her poverty, so I largessed it to
her.” Rejoined she, “Say me, was the old woman she who was
mounted on the dromedary, the owner of the valuable necklace
which she sold to thee for a kiss when thou saidst to her:—O
<span class="pageno" id="Page_95">95</span>Winsome of Eyes, bussing without treading I trow, is as a
bowyer sans bow.” Now when her words were ended, O Commander
of the Faithful, she turned to her women and cried to
them, “Bring hither this moment Sa’ídíyah, the kitchen-wench,”
and when she came between her hands behold, she was a slave-girl,
a negress, and she was the same in species and substance
who came to me under the form of a Badawi woman with a face-veil
of brocade covering her features. Hereupon my wife drew
the Burka’ from before the woman’s face and caused her doff
her dress, and when she was stripped she was black as a bit
of charcoal. Now as soon as I saw this, O Viceregent of Allah,
my wits were bewildered and I considered my affair and I knew
not what to do, thinking of the conditions whereto I had consented——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab
continued:—And I thought of the conditions whereto I had
consented and the penalty which had been written for me by the
Kazi in the presence of his assessors, so I wandered from my right
mind when she looked at me and said, “Is this our compact,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_96">96</span>O Manjab hight, thou dogs’ trysting-site?” and when I heard her
speech, O Commander of the Faithful, I hanged my head groundwards
and could not return a reply, nor even attempt to address
her could I. Said she, “Woe to thee, did I not say to thee:—O
Manjab hight, thou who with curs dost unite and no foregatherer
with friendly wight? Woe to thee, and he lied not who
said that in men-kind there be no trust. But how, O Manjab,
didst thou prefer this slave-girl before me and make her my equal
in dress and semblance? However, O ye women, do ye send and
bring the Kazi and the assessors at this moment and instant.”
So they fetched them without stay or delay, and they produced
the obligation which had been written, with the penalty duly
attested by testimony. Then she said to the witnesses, “Read
all that for him,” and they did so and asked me, “What hast
thou to say about this obligation and the punishment for breaking
it?” Answered I, “The document is right and fair, nor have I
aught to utter thereanent.” Hereupon, O Prince of True Believers,
she summoned the Governor and his officials, and I confessed
before them and bore witness against myself, when they reviled
me and abused me, and I told them the tale full and complete.
But they would not excuse me and they all cried, “Verily, thou
deservest splitting or quartering;<a id="r143"></a><a href="#f143" class="c012"><sup>[143]</sup></a> thou who wouldst abandon this
beauty and perfection and brilliancy and stature and symmetry
and wouldst throw thyself upon a slave-girl black as charcoal;
thou who wouldst leave this semblance which is like the splendours
of moonlight and wouldst follow yon fulsome figure which
resembleth the murks of night.” Hereupon, O Prince of True
<span class="pageno" id="Page_97">97</span>Believers, she said to the Governor, “Hearken unto what I tell
thee. I bear witness against myself that I have excused him the
cutting off his hand and tongue and the plucking out his eyes;
but do ye redeem my rights of him by one condition.” “And
what may that be?” asked they; and she answered, “A thousand
stripes upon his right side, and as many upon his left ribs.” Hereupon,
O Commander of the Faithful, they seized me and smote
me upon my right flank until I was estranged from the world,<a id="r144"></a><a href="#f144" class="c012"><sup>[144]</sup></a>
and after they took a handful of salt, which they rubbed upon
the wounds.<a id="r145"></a><a href="#f145" class="c012"><sup>[145]</sup></a> Then they applied a thousand stripes to my left
ribs, and threw over me a ragged robe wherewith to veil my
shame. But my flanks had been torn open by such a bastinado,
nor did I recover for a space of three days, when I found myself
lying cast-out upon a dunghill. Seeing this my condition, I
pulled myself together, and arising walked to the mansion wherein
I was wont to wone; but I found the door locked with three
padlocks and it was empty and void, nor was voice or sound to be
heard therein at all, and ’twas, as said one of the poets in this
couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“The chambers were like a beehive well stocked; when the bees quitted them they became empty.”<a id="r146"></a><a href="#f146" class="c012"><sup>[146]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">So I lingered there an hour of time, when a woman suddenly came
out from one of the neighbouring houses and asked me, “What
dost thou want, O asker; and what seekest thou?” I answered,
“We are in quest of the owners of this mansion;” and said she,
“Here they were in crowds and then they abandoned it, and may
Allah have mercy upon him who spake these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_98">98</span>“They fared and with faring fled rest from me ✿ And my parted heart no repose can see:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then indeed I repented, O Commander of the Faithful, over that
I had done and regretted what had befallen me and what had
proceeded from me of ill-deeds, and quoth I to the woman who
had addressed me, “Allah upon thee, O my mistress, say me,
hast thou of their traces any tidings?”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent, and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and

and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab,
speaking to the woman, said, “O my lady; say me, dost thou
know of their traces any tidings, and hast thou come upon any
manifest news?” Said she, “This thing was to befal thee of old,
O thou poor fellow, even as quoth the poet in the following
couplets:—</p>

      <div class="line">Fate hath won the race in departing me ✿ And who with Fate can avail contest?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then, O Commander of the Faithful, my longings grew and I
poured fast tears in torrents and I was like to choke with my
sobs, so I arose to walk about the city highways and I clung
from wall to wall for what befel me of despight and affright
at the disappearance of them,<a id="r147"></a><a href="#f147" class="c012"><sup>[147]</sup></a> and as I wandered about I repeated

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">After this, O Prince of True Believers, I remained immersed in
cark and care and anxious thought, and as ever I wandered
about behold, a man met me and said, “’Tis now three days
since they marched away and none wotteth where they have
alighted.”<a id="r148"></a><a href="#f148" class="c012"><sup>[148]</sup></a> So I returned once more to the mansion door and
I sat beside it to take my rest when my glance was raised and
fell upon the lintel and I saw attached to it a folded paper which
I hent in hand and found written therein these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Scant shall avail with judgement just the tear ✿ When at love-humbled heart man dareth jeer:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_100">100</span>I was thy dearling, fain with thee to dwell ✿ But thou transgressedst nor return canst speer:</div>
      <div class="line">And if by every means thou find me not, ✿ From thee I fled and other hold I dear:</div>
      <div class="line">I come in dreams to see if sore thy heart; ✿ Let it take patience in its woe sincere:</div>

      <div class="line">Ho, stander at my door, once honoured guest, ✿ Haply my tidings thou some day shalt hear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereupon, O Commander of the Faithful, I returned to my
mother and sister and told them the tale of what had betided
me, first and last, and the twain wept over me and my parent
said, “I thought not, O my son, that such case as this would
come down upon thee; withal every calamity save Death is no
calamity at all; so be thou of long-suffering, O my child, for the
compensation of patience is upon Allah; and indeed this that
hath happened to thee hath happened unto many the likes of
thee, and know thou that Fate is effectual and Sort is sealed.
Hast thou not heard the words of the poet who spoke these
couplets:<a id="r149"></a><a href="#f149" class="c012"><sup>[149]</sup></a>—</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_101">101</span>Now when I heard these words of my mother, O Prince of True

Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Forty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Manjab said,
“O Commander of the Faithful, I had patience and rendered my
account to Allah Almighty. Then my mother fell to nursing me,
with medicines and unguents and what not else of remedies wherefrom
cometh health until I was healed, yet there remained to me
the scars even as thou sawest. But I inscribed not those lines
upon my house which thou didst espy, O Commander of the
Faithful, save that the news thereof might reach thee, and that
naught be concealed from thee of my tidings and my past fate,
and present condition. And this is the whole that hath befallen
me.”<a id="r150"></a><a href="#f150" class="c012"><sup>[150]</sup></a> Now when the Caliph Harun al-Rashid heard these words
he smote hand upon hand and cried, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah the Glorious, the Great.” Then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_102">102</span>he cried upon the Minister Ja’afar the Barmecide, and said to him,
“O Wazir, unless thou bring me information of this affair and root
out this matter and make manifest to me the condition of this
youth, verily I will smite thy neck.” The Minister answered,
“Hearing and obeying: however, do thou, O Commander of the
Faithful, give me three days’ delay,” and the Caliph rejoined, “I
have granted this to thee.” Hereupon Ja’afar went forth like unto
one blind and deaf, unseeing nor hearing aught, and he was perplext
and distraught as to his affair and continued saying, “Would
Heaven we had not forgathered with this youth, nor ever had seen
the sight of him.” And he ceased not faring till he arrived at his
own house, where he changed his dress and fell to threading the
thoroughfares of Baghdad, which in the time of Harun al-Rashid
was a mighty great city, and in every street he entered he sought
intelligence and questioned the folk concerning every affair which
had happened in town from dawn to dark, but he hit upon no
trace nor information manifest touching this matter. On the
second day it was the same, and nothing became known to him
between morning and evening; but on the third day as he fared
forth he repeated these words:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“With the King be familiar and ’ware his wrath ✿ Nor be wilful when cometh his order ’Do.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And he crossed and recrossed the city until it was noon-tide
without aught of novelty appearing to him, so he returned to
his mansion where he had a confidential nurse whom he apprised
of the tidings and, concealing naught from her said, “Verily the
term allowed to me by the King is until set of sun, at which time
unless I bring him the information required he will cut off my
head.” Thereupon the Kahramánah went forth and circled through
the city until it was mid-afternoon, but she brought back no fresh
tidings; whereat Ja’afar cried, “There is no Majesty and there is
no Might, save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!” Now the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_103">103</span>Wazir had a sister who lived single in his home with her women
and eunuchs, and he said to himself, “I will go to my sister Budúr
and solace myself by conversing awhile with her and farewell
her: haply Fate is not afar.” This sister was yet unwedded
for none dared come forward and propose marriage to her, albeit
in the city of Baghdad not one was her peer in beauty, even
amongst the women of the Caliph. Accordingly he turned towards
her apartment and entered therein, when she met him upon the
threshold of the gate, and as she saw him changed of condition
she cried, “No harm to thee, O my brother, verily thou art altered
in case;” and he replied, “Indeed I have fallen into evil plight
and into a matter of affright, whereupon naught can deliver me
save the power of Allah of All-might, and unless the affair be made
evident to me by the morning the Caliph will cut off my head.”
Then he related to her the affair from beginning to end, and she,
when she heard the words of her brother, waxed wan of colour, and
was altered in case and said, “O brother mine, give me immunity
and a binding bond when I will explain to thee the matter of
this youth.” Hereat calmed was his affright, and his heart was
satisfied quite, and he gave her promise of safety and a binding
bond and contract not to harm her; whereupon said she to him,
“O my brother, womankind was created for mankind, and mankind
was created for womankind, and albe falsehood is an excuse,
yet soothfastness is more saving and safe-guiding. The whole of this
business is mine and I am she who married him and made with
him that condition which he accepted for himself, being contented
with the covenant and its penalty.” Now when Ja’afar heard these
words spoken to him by his sister concerning the case of Manjab,
he outwardly made merry but he inwardly mourned, for that he
had forbidden her to wed, and she had worked this craft and had
given herself away to wife. Hereupon he arose without stay or
delay and fared forth until he went in to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid
whom he blessed and greeted, and the King, having
<span class="pageno" id="Page_104">104</span>returned his salam, asked him, “Hast thou brought to me the
required tidings, O Ja’afar?” The Wazir answered, “Yes, O my
lord, the news hath become manifest and ’tis certified to me that
this is a private matter; and had not the Creator favoured me by
forgathering with the young lady in her substance and accidence and
had I not met her at a term not appointed, I should have been done
to die.” Quoth the Caliph, “And who is she that I may requite her
for her deeds and for what she hath practised upon Manjab, who
verily deserveth not that which hath betided him, although he may
have been somewhat in fault.” Then Ja’afar came forward and craved
pardon from the Caliph in token of honour for his sister’s sake, and
quoth his lord, “O Ja’afar, thou hast declared that she it is with
whom thou hast forgathered.” Quoth Ja’afar, “O Prince of True
Believers, the same is my sister Budúr.” But when the Caliph
heard these words, he asked, “O Ja’afar, and why did thy sister
do such deed?” and the Wazir answered, “Whatso is fated shall
take place nor shall any defer the predestined nor forbid it when
decreed, nor hasten it when forbidden. This thing which hath
happened was of no profit to anyone and whatever thou shalt
ordain that shall be done.” Thereat Manjab after saluting the
Caliph, accompanied Ja’afar to the house of his sister, and when
they went in the Wazir made peace between the two, and the Caliph
largessed the youth with most sumptuous presents. Now the
Caliph every year at times appointed was accustomed to go by
night in disguise to the house of Manjab accompanied by Ja’afar
for the sake of hearing music, and one night of the nights he said
to the youth, “Alhamdolillah—Glory be to God—O Manjab, that I
have caused reunion between thee and Budúr, thy beloved; but I
desire that thou tell me some tale which shall be rare and shall
broaden my breast.” The youth replied, “Hearing and obeying,”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
<span class="pageno" id="Page_105">105</span>enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared

<h3 class="c013"><em>STORY OF THE DARWAYSH AND THE BARBER’S BOY AND THE GREEDY SULTAN.</em></h3>

<p class="c014">It is related (but Allah is All-knowing of hidden things and All-wise!)
that in the days of a King called Dahmár<a id="r151"></a><a href="#f151" class="c012"><sup>[151]</sup></a> there was a
barber who had in his booth a boy for apprentice and one day
of the days there came in a Darwaysh man who took seat and
turning to the lad saw that he was a model of beauty and loveliness
and stature and symmetric grace. So he asked him for a
mirror and when it was brought he took it and considered his face
therein and combed his beard, after which he put hand in pouch
and pulling out an Ashrafi of gold set it upon the looking-glass
<span class="pageno" id="Page_106">106</span>which he gave back to the boy.<a id="r152"></a><a href="#f152" class="c012"><sup>[152]</sup></a> Hereupon the barber turned
towards the beggar and wondered in himself and said, “Praise be
to Allah, albeit this man be a Fakir yet he placeth a golden piece
upon the mirror, and surely this is a marvellous matter.” Hereupon
the Darwaysh went his ways, and on the following day he
suddenly made his appearance and entering the booth called for a
looking-glass from the barber’s prentice and when it was handed
to him combed his beard after he had looked at his features
therein; then, bringing forth an Ashrafi, he set it upon the mirror
and gave it back to the boy; and the barber marvelled yet the
more to see the Fakir rising up and wending his ways.<a id="r153"></a><a href="#f153" class="c012"><sup>[153]</sup></a> The
beggar ceased not coming every day and gazing at himself in the
glass and laying down his ducat, whereat the barber said to himself,
“By Allah, indeed this Darwaysh must have some object of
his own and haply he is in love with the lad my prentice and I
fear from the beggar lest he seduce the boy and take him away
from me.” Hereat he cried, “O boy, when the Darwaysh shall
come to thee draw thou not anear him; and when he demandeth
the looking-glass give it not to him; for I myself will do so.” On
the third day behold, the Fakir appeared according to his custom
and asked for the mirror from the boy who wittingly disregarded
him, whereupon he turned towards him and waxed wroth<a id="r154"></a><a href="#f154" class="c012"><sup>[154]</sup></a> and
was like to slay him. The apprentice was terrified at his rage
and gave him the looking-glass whilst he was still an-angered;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_107">107</span>but when the man had reviewed himself therein and had combed
his beard and had finished his need, he brought out ten dinars of
gold and setting them upon the mirror handed them to the lad.
Seeing this the barber wondered anew with extreme wonderment,
saying to himself, “By Allah, this Darwaysh cometh daily and
layeth down an Ashrafi, but this day he hath given ten gold
pieces; withal there accrueth not to me from my shop even half
a piastre of daily wage. However, O Boy, when the man shall
come hither, as is his wont, do thou spread for him a prayer-rug
in the inner room of the shop, lest the people seeing his constant
visits should have ill suspicions of us.” “Yes!” said the lad.
So when it was the next day the Fakir came and went into the
ben whither he was shown by the boy, and he followed him till
they were in the innermost of the booth. Now the heart of
this Religious hung to the love of the barber’s boy for that he had
of beauty and perfection and he continued frequenting the shop
every day whilst the lad ceased not spreading the rug and
receiving upon the mirror ten Ashrafis. Hereat the barber and
his apprentice rejoiced till one day of the days when the
Darwaysh came to the shaving-shop, as was his wont, where he
met none but only the boy nor was there any other in sight. So
he asked concerning his employer and the other answered, “O
uncle, my master hath gone forth to solace himself with seeing
the casting of the cannon; for this day the Sultan and the Wazir
and the Lords of the land will all be present thereat.” Said he,
“O my son, go thou with us and we will also enjoy the spectacle
and return before the rest of the folk, ere thy master can be
back, and we will enjoy ourselves and make merry and look at
the sport before I set out upon my journey, for ’tis my intention
this day to go forth about noontide.” Quoth the lad, “’Tis well
O uncle;” and arising he locked the shop-door and walked with
the Darwaysh till they reached the spot where the cannon were
being cast. There they found the Sultan and the Wazirs and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_108">108</span>Chamberlains and the Lords of the land and the Grandees of the
realm all standing in a body until presently the workmen took the
crucibles<a id="r155"></a><a href="#f155" class="c012"><sup>[155]</sup></a> from off the fire. Now the first who went up to them
was the Sultan and he found them full of molten brass: so he
put his hand into his pocket and drew it forth full of gold which
he cast into the melting pots. Then the Grand Wazir walked
forward and did as the King had done and all the Notables who
were present threw cash into the crucibles, bar-silver and piastres
and dollars. Thereat the Darwaysh stepped out of the crowd
and brought from his cowl a reed used as an étui<a id="r156"></a><a href="#f156" class="c012"><sup>[156]</sup></a> wherefrom he drew
a spoon-like ear-picker and cast into one of the crucibles a something
of powder like grain.<a id="r157"></a><a href="#f157" class="c012"><sup>[157]</sup></a> This he did to each one of the melting
pots; after which he disappeared from the eyes of the folk and
taking the boy with him returned to the booth and opened it and
said to him, “O my child, when the Sultan shall send after thee
and shall question thee concerning me, do thou tell him that I
am in such a town where shouldst thou come to seek me thou
shalt find me sitting beside the gate.” Then he farewelled the
boy, the barber’s apprentice, and set forth seeking that city. Such
was the case with these twain; but as regards the matter of the
King, he ceased not standing there until they had brought the
crucibles to the cannon-moulds and when the folks designed to
pour out their contents they found all therein pure gold. Then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_109">109</span>quoth the Sultan to the Wazir and the Notables of his realm,
“Who was it threw aught into the crucibles and what stranger man
happened to be here?” Quoth they, “We beheld a Darwaysh
man who took some powder and fell to casting thereof a somewhat
into the crucibles.” Hereupon enquiries were made of the
bystanders and they gave information how that same Darwaysh
was inclined to the barber’s apprentice who lived in such a quarter.
Hereupon the Sultan ordered one of his Chamberlains to bring
the boy,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night

    <div>The Six Hundred and Fifty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sent one of his Chamberlains to the boy, the apprentice of the
barber, whom they sought for and brought into the presence and
placed between the royal hands; and he on entering kissed ground
and deprecated and prayed for his liege lord with prayers fit for
the Caliphs. The Sovran returned his salam and questioned him
concerning the Darwaysh who had been with him and he replied,
“O King of the Realm, he charged me saying that he was faring
for and would be found in such a city.” Hereupon the Sultan
commanded the lad go forth and bring him, and was answered,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_110">110</span>“Hearkening and obedience;” so he appointed for him an especial
ship and gifted him with various presents and the boy set sail and
voyaged for a short while till he reached the port-town in question.
Here he landed and made for the city-gate and as he entered it
behold, he came face to face with the Darwaysh who was
sitting upon a raised bench, and when he beheld him he salam’d
to him and told him what had taken place. The Fakir at
once arose, and without resisting the lad, went down to
the ship and they shook out the sails and the two voyaged
together until they reached the city of the Sultan. Here the
twain went in to him and kissed ground between his hands and
salam’d to him and their greeting was answered. Now as to the
lad, the King largessed him largely and raised his degree to
Governor and despatched him to one of his provinces therein to
rule;<a id="r158"></a><a href="#f158" class="c012"><sup>[158]</sup></a> but as for the Darwaysh, he remained beside King Dahmár
the first day and the second until the seventh; after which quoth
the Sovran, “’Tis my desire that thou teach me the art and
mystery of making gold;” whereto the other replied, “Hearing
and obeying, O our lord the Sultan.” Presently the Darwaysh
arose; and, bringing a brazier,<a id="r159"></a><a href="#f159" class="c012"><sup>[159]</sup></a> ranged thereupon the implements
of his industry and lighted a fire thereunder; then, fetching a
portion of lead and a modicum of tin and a quant. suff. of copper,
the whole weighing about a quintal, he fanned the flame that was
beneath the crucible until the metal was fluid as water. And
while the Sultan was sitting and looking on and considering the
operation, the Fakir brought out something from a casket and taking
a pinch of it on the ear-picker besprinkled therewith the lead and
copper and the tin which presently became virgin gold. He
repeated this feat once or twice before the King who after that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_111">111</span>fell to working as the Religious had wrought and turned out in
his presence the purest gold. So the Sultan rejoiced and was
wont to sit before the Darwaysh whatever time his heart chose<a id="r160"></a><a href="#f160" class="c012"><sup>[160]</sup></a>
and there and then he gathered together ignoble metals and
besprinkled them with the powder<a id="r161"></a><a href="#f161" class="c012"><sup>[161]</sup></a> which had been given to him
by the Fakir and all came out of the noblest gold. Now one night
of the nights, as the Sultan was sitting in his Harem and would
have worked as he had wrought in the presence of the Darwaysh,
nothing went right with him; whereat he was exceedingly sorrowful
and said, “I have neither magnified nor minished aught, so how
is this case?”<a id="r162"></a><a href="#f162" class="c012"><sup>[162]</sup></a> As soon as it was morning he forgathered with
the Fakir and worked in his presence and produced virgin gold;
so in his surprise he said, “Walláhi, ’tis indeed most marvellous
that whatso I work alone cometh not right and when I have
wrought in presence of the Darwaysh it succeedeth and turneth to
gold.” After this the Sultan never transmuted metals save in the
presence of the Fakir, until one day of the days when his breast
was narrowed and he sought recreation in the gardens. Accordingly
he rode forth, he and the Lords of the land, taking also the
Darwaysh with him and he went to the riverside, the Monarch preceding
and the Mendicant following together with the suite. And as
the King rode along with a heavy hand upon the reins he grasped
them strongly and his fist closed upon them; but suddenly he relaxed
his grip when his seal-ring flew from his little finger and fell into
the water, where it sank to the bottom. Seeing this the Sultan
drew bridle and halted and said, “We will on no wise remove from
this place till such time as my seal-ring shall be restored to me.”
So the suite dismounted, one and all, and designed plunging into
<span class="pageno" id="Page_112">112</span>the stream, when behold, the Fakir finding the King standing
alone and in woeful plight by cause of his signet asked him
saying, “What is to do with thee, O King of the Age, that I find
thee here halted?” He replied, “Verily my signet-ring of Kingship<a id="r163"></a><a href="#f163" class="c012"><sup>[163]</sup></a>
hath dropped from me into the river somewhere about this
place.” Quoth the Darwaysh, “Be not grieved, O our lord;” after
which he brought out from his breast pocket a pencase, and having
drawn from it a bit of bees’ wax, he fashioned it into the form of
a man and cast it into the water. Then he stood gazing thereat
when, lo and behold! the Figure came forth the river with the seal-ring
hanging to its neck and sprang upon the saddle-bow in front
of the Sultan. The King would have taken his signet when the
Form jumped off and approached the Darwaysh who hent the
ring in hand and rubbed it and the Figure at once became wax as
it had been. Hereupon the Darwaysh restored it to his pencase
and said to the Sovran, “Now do thou ride on!” All this and the
Lords of the land sat gazing upon the Darwaysh and what he had
done; after which the whole party fared forwards till they reached
the gardens, where they dismounted and took seat and fell to
conversing together. They enjoyed themselves that day and when
evening fell they remounted and sought their homes, and the
Darwaysh returned to the apartment which had been set apart
for him. But presently the Grandees of the realm forgathered
with the Sultan and said to him, “O King of the Age, yon Darwaysh
requireth of thee exceeding caution seeing that he, whenso
he ever will, availeth to slay everyone in the Palace, and after
doing thee die can raise himself to rule in thy stead.” “How
so?” quoth the King, and quoth they, “In that ’twere easy for
him to make Figures of wax and cause them prevail over thee
and over us, so that they may kill us and he may succeed thee as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_113">113</span>Sultan; nor would this be aught of inconvenience to him.” Now
when the King heard these words he was afeared and cried, “By
Allah, sooth ye speak, and this is the right rede and one which
may not be blamed indeed!” presently adding, “And how shall
we manage with this Darwaysh?” Said they, “Do thou send for
him and summon him and slay him forthright; and better ’twere
that thou kill him ere he kill thee;<a id="r164"></a><a href="#f164" class="c012"><sup>[164]</sup></a> and if he say thee I will go
and return, suffer him not depart.” The Sultan acted after their
counsel and sending to fetch the Fakir——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sent after the Darwaysh and bade him be brought into the presence
and set between his hands, when he said to him, “O Darwaysh, do
thou know ’tis mine aim and intention to slay thee: say me then,
hast thou any charge thou wouldst send to thy family?” Quoth
the Religious, “Wherefore shouldst thou kill me, O our lord, and
what of ill deeds hath proceeded from me that thou shouldst
<span class="pageno" id="Page_114">114</span>destroy me therefor, and do thou make me aware of my sin, and
then if I merit death kill me or decree to me banishment.” Quoth
the King, “There is no help but that I slay thee,”<a id="r165"></a><a href="#f165" class="c012"><sup>[165]</sup></a> and the Darwaysh
fell to gentling him but it availed him naught; so as soon
as he was certified that the Sultan would not release him or dismiss
him, he arose and drew a wide ring upon the ground in noose shape
and measuring some fifteen ells, within which he described a lesser
circle. Then he stood up before the Sovran and said, “O King of
the Age, verily this greater circle is the dominion belonging to thee,
whilst the lesser round is mine own realm.” So saying he moved
from his place and stepped forwards and passing into the smaller
ring quoth he, “An thy reign, O King of the Age, be not ample for
me I will inhabit my own;” and forthright upon entering the
lesser circle he vanished from the view of those present. Cried
the Sultan to the Lords of the land, “Seize him”; but they availed
not to find him, and after going forth in search they returned and
reported that they could light upon no one. Then said the Sovran,
“He was beside me in this place and passed into the smaller ring;
so do ye seek for him again;” and accordingly they went forth
once more but could not see a trace of him. Hereupon the Sultan
repented and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah the Glorious, the Great: verily we have exceeded in
the matter of this Darwaysh and we have hearkened to the words
of hypocrites who caused us to fall into trouble by obeying them
in all they said to me against him. However, whatso they did to
me that will I do unto them.” And as soon as it was morning-tide
and the Lords of the land forgathered in the Divan, the Sultan
commanded to slay those who had counselled him to kill the Darwaysh,
and some of them were done to death and others of them
were banished the country.<a id="r166"></a><a href="#f166" class="c012"><sup>[166]</sup></a> Now when the Caliph Harun al-Rashid
<span class="pageno" id="Page_115">115</span>heard this narrative from Manjab, he wondered with
extreme wonderment and said to him, “By Allah, O Manjab, thou
deservest to be a cup-companion of the Kings:” so he created
him from that moment his Equerry in honour to the Grand Wazir
Ja’áfar the Barmaki, whereof he had become brother-in-law. Now
after some time Al-Rashid asked from Manjab a tale concerning the
wiles of womankind, and when the youth hung his head groundwards
and blushed before him, Harun said to him, “O Manjab,
verily the place of the Kings in privacy is also the place for laying
aside gravity.” Said Manjab, “O Prince of True Believers, to-morrow
night (Inshallah!) I will tell thee a tale in brief concerning
the freaks of the gender feminine, and what things they do with
their mates.” Accordingly when night came on, the Caliph sent
for and summoned Manjab to the presence, and when he came
there he kissed ground and said, “An it be thy will, O Commander
of the Faithful, that I relate thee aught concerning the wiles of
wives, let it be in a private place lest haply one of the slave girls
hear me and any of them report my tale to the Queen.” Quoth
Rashid, “This is the right rede which may not be blamed indeed!”
So he went with him to a private place concealed from the folk,
and took seat, he and the youth, and none beside, when Manjab
related to him the following</p>

</div>

<p class="c014">It is related that there was a Badawi man who had a wife and he
dwelt under a tent of hair<a id="r168"></a><a href="#f168" class="c012"><sup>[168]</sup></a> in the desert where, as is the fashion
of Arabs, he used to shift from site to site for the purpose of
pasturing his camels. Now the woman was of exceeding beauty
and comeliness and perfection, and she had a friend (also a Badawi
man) who at all times would come to her and have his wicked will
of her, after which he would wend his ways. But one day of the
days her lover visited her and said, “Walláhi, ’tis not possible but
that what time we sleep together, I and thou, we make merry with
thy husband looking on.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the man which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_117">117</span>was the friend of the Badawi’s wife said to her, “Walláhi, ’tis not
possible but that when we make merry, I and thou, thy husband
shall look upon us.” Quoth she, “Why should we suffer at such
time of our enjoyment either my husband or any wight to be
present?” and quoth he, “This must needs be, and unless thou
consent I will take to me a mistress other than thyself.” Then
said she, “How shall we enjoy ourselves with my husband looking
on? This is a matter which may not be managed.” Hereupon
the woman sat down and took thought of her affair and how she
should do for an hour or so, and presently she arose and dug her
amiddlemost the tent a hole<a id="r169"></a><a href="#f169" class="c012"><sup>[169]</sup></a> which would contain a man, wherein
she concealed her lover. Now, hard by the tent was a tall sycamore
tree,<a id="r170"></a><a href="#f170" class="c012"><sup>[170]</sup></a> and as the noodle her husband was returning from the
wild the woman said to him, “Ho thou, Such-an-one! climb up
this tree and bring me therefrom a somewhat of figs that we may
eat them.” Said he, “’Tis well;” and arising he swarmed up the
tree-trunk, when she signed to her lover who came out and mounted
and fell to riding upon her. But her mate considered her and
cried aloud, “What is this, O whore: doth a man cavalcade thee
before me and the while I am looking at thee?” Then he came
down from the tree in haste, but he saw no one, for as soon as the
lover had finished his business the good-wife thrust him into the
hole amiddlemost the tent and covered him with a mat. When
the husband went inside to the booth and met his wife he found
no stranger with her so said she to him, “O man, thou hast sinned
against me, saying:—Verily, some one is riding thee; and thou
hast slandered me by falsely charging me with folly.” Quoth he,
“By Allah I saw thee with my own eyes;” but quoth she, “Do
thou sit here the while I have a look.” Hereupon she arose and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_118">118</span>swarmed up the trunk and sat upon one of the branches, and as
she peered at her spouse she shrieked aloud crying, “O man, do
thou have some regard for thine honour. Why do on this wise
and lie down and allow a man to ride thee, and at this moment he
worketh his will on thee.” Said her husband, “Beside me there
is neither man nor boy.” And said she, “Here I am<a id="r171"></a><a href="#f171" class="c012"><sup>[171]</sup></a> looking
at thee from the top of this tree.” Quoth he, “O woman, this
place must be haunted,<a id="r172"></a><a href="#f172" class="c012"><sup>[172]</sup></a> so let us remove hence;” and quoth she,
“Why change our place? rather let us remain therein.” Hereupon
the Caliph said to Manjab, “By Allah, verily, this woman
was an adulteress;” and the youth replied, “Amongst womankind
indeed are many more whorish than this. But of that anon; and

  <h3 class="c013"><em>NOTE CONCERNING THE “TIRREA BEDE,” NIGHT 655.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c015">Scott refers to a tale in the “Bahar-Danush” (Bahár-i-Dánish); or, “Garden of
Knowledge,” translated by himself, story viii. lesson 4; chapter xii. vol. iii. pp. 64–68.
Cadell &amp; Co., Strand, London, 1799. Five women come from a town to draw water at
a well; and, finding there a young Brahmin, become his teachers and undertake to
instruct him in the “Tirrea” or fifth “Veda”—there being only four of these Hindu
Scriptures. Each lesson consists of an adventure showing how to cornute a husband, and
the fourth runs as follows. I leave them in Scott’s language:—</p>

<p class="c011">The fourth lady through dread of the arrow of whose cunning the warrior of the fifth
heaven<a id="r173"></a><a href="#f173" class="c012"><sup>[173]</sup></a> trembled in the sky, like the reed, having bestowed her attention on the pilgrim
bramin (Brahman), despatched him to an orchard; and having gone home, said to her
husband, “I have heard that in the orchard of a certain husbandman there is a date
tree, the fruit of which is of remarkably fine flavour; but what is yet stranger, whoever
ascends it, sees many wonderful objects. If to-day, going to visit this orchard, we gather
dates from this tree, and also see the wonders of it, it will not be unproductive of
amusement.” In short, she so worked upon her husband with flattering speeches and
caresses, that <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolens volens</span> he went to the orchard, and at the instigation of his wife,
ascended the tree. At this instant she beckoned to the bramin, who was previously
seated, expectantly, in a corner of the garden.</p>

<p class="c011">The husband, from the top of the tree, beholding what was not fit to be seen, exclaimed
in extreme rage, “Ah! thou shameless Russian-born<a id="r174"></a><a href="#f174" class="c012"><sup>[174]</sup></a> wretch, what abominable action is
this?” The wife making not the least answer, the flames of anger seized the mind of
the man, and he began to descend from the tree; when the bramin with activity and
speed having hurried over the fourth section of the Tirrea Bede,<a id="r175"></a><a href="#f175" class="c012"><sup>[175]</sup></a> went his way.</p>

<h3 class="c013">VERSE.</h3>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c016">
    <div><em>The road to repose is that of activity and quickness.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c011">The wife during her husband’s descent from the tree having arranged her plan, said,
“Surely, man, frenzy must have deprived thy brain of the fumes of sense, that having
foolishly set up such a cry, and not reflecting upon thy own disgrace (for here, excepting
thyself, what male is present?), thou wouldst fix upon me the charge of infidelity?”
The husband, when he saw no person near, was astonished, and said to himself,
“Certainly, this vision must have been miraculous.”</p>

<p class="c011">The completely artful wife, from the hesitation of her husband, guessed the cause, and
impudently began to abuse him. Then instantly tying her vest round her waist she
ascended the tree. When she had reached the topmost branch, she suddenly cried out,
“O thou shameless man, what abominable action is this! If thy evil star hath led thee
from the path of virtue, surely thou mightest have in secret ventured upon it. Doubtless
to pull down the curtain of modesty from thy eyes, and with such impudence to commit
such a wicked deed is the very extreme of debauchery.”</p>

<p class="c011"><span class="pageno" id="Page_120">120</span>The husband replied, “Woman, do not ridiculously cry out, but be silent; for such is the
property of this tree, that whoever ascends it, sees man or woman below in such situations.”
The cunning wife now came down, and said to her husband, “What a charming garden
and amusing spot is this! where one can gather fruit, and at the same time behold the
wonders of the world.” The husband replied, “Destruction seize the wonders which
falsely accuse man of abomination!” In short the devilish wife, notwithstanding the
impudence of such an action, escaped safely to her house, and the next day, according
to custom, attending at the well, introduced the bramin to the ladies, and informed them
of her worthy contrivance.<a id="r176"></a><a href="#f176" class="c012"><sup>[176]</sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_123">123</span>I had a familiar in the Northern region who was called ’Abd al-Jawád
and he was one of the greatest of merchants there and
made of money; also he loved voyage and travel, and at whatever
time I visited him and we forgathered, I and he, we exchanged
citations of poetry. Now one day my heart yearned to visit him,
so I repaired to his place and found him there; and as we came
together we both sat down in friendly converse, I and he; and he
said to me:—“O my brother, do thou hear what happened and was
accomplished for me in these times. I travelled to the land of
Al-Yaman and therein met a familiar who, when we sat down to
talk, I and he, said:—O my brother, verily there befel me and
betided me in the land of Al-Hind a case that was strange and an
adventure that was admirable and it ran as follows. There was
erewhile a King of the kings of India and one of her greatest,
who was abundant in money and troops and guards and he was
called Al-Mihrján.”<a id="r178"></a><a href="#f178" class="c012"><sup>[178]</sup></a> This same was a lord of high degree and a
majestic and he had lived for a long while of his age without
having issue male or female. Wherefor he was full of cark and
care wanting one who after him would preserve his memory, so he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_124">124</span>said in his mind one night of the nights, “Whenas I die cut off
shall be my name, and effaced shall be my fame nor shall anyone
remember me.” So saying he raised both hands to Heaven and
humbled himself before Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) to
vouchsafe him a child who should outlive him with the view that
man might not lose the memory of him. Now one night as he
was sleeping a-bed dreaming and drowned in slumber behold, he
heard a Voice (without seeing any form) which said to him, “O
Mihrjan the Sage, and O King of the Age, arouse thee this
moment and go to thy wife and lie with her and know her
carnally, for she shall indeed conceive of thee at this very hour
and bear thee a child which, an it be a boy shall become thine
aider in all thine affairs but will, an it prove a girl, cause thy ruin
and thy destruction and the uprooting of thy traces.” When
Al-Mihrjan heard from the Speaker these words and such sayings,
he left his couch without stay or delay in great joy and gladness
and he went to his wife and slept with her and swived her and as
soon as he arose from off her she said, “O King of the Age,
verily I feel that I have become pregnant; and (Inshallah—if
Almighty Allah please!) this shall prove the case.”<a id="r179"></a><a href="#f179" class="c012"><sup>[179]</sup></a> When Al-Mihrjan
heard the words of his wife he was glad and rejoiced at
good news and he caused that night be documented in the archives
of his kingdom. Then, when it was morning he took seat upon
the throne of his kingship and summoned the Astrologers and the
Scribes of characts and Students of the skies and told them what
had been accomplished to him in his night and what words he had
heard from the Voice; whereupon the Sages one and all struck
tables of sand and considered the ascendant. But each and every
of them concealed his thought and hid all he had seen nor would
any return a reply or aught of address would supply; and said
they, “O King of the Age, verily appearances in dreams hit the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_125">125</span>mark at times and at times fly wide; for when a man is of a
melancholic humour he seeth in his sleep things which be terrible
and horrible and he waxeth startled thereat: haply this vision
thou hast beheld may be of the imbroglios of dreams so do thou
commit the reins to Him who all overreigns and the best Worker
is He of all that wisheth and willeth He.” Now when Al-Mihrjan
heard these words of the Sages and the Star-gazers he gifted and
largessed them and he freed the captives in prison mewed and he
clothed the widows and the poor and nude. But his heart remained
in sore doubt concerning what he had heard from the Voice and he
was thoughtful over that matter and bewildered and he knew not
what to do; and on such wise sped those days. Now, however,
returneth the tale to the Queen his Consort who, when her months
had gone by, proved truly to be pregnant and her condition showed
itself, so she sent to inform her husband thereof. He was gladdened
and rejoiced in the good news and when the months of gestation
were completed the labour-pains set in and she was delivered of a
girl-child (praise be to Him who had created and had perfected
what He had produced in this creation!), which was winsome of
face and lovesome of form and fair fashioned of limbs, with cheeks
rosaceous and eyne gracious and eyebrows continuous and perfect
in symmetrical proportion. Now after the midwives delivered her
from the womb and cut her navel-string and kohl’d her eyes, they
sent for King Al-Mihrjan and informed him that his Queen had
borne a maid-babe, but when the Eunuchs gave this message, his
breast was narrowed and he was bewildered in his wits, and rising
without stay or delay he went to his wife. Here they brought to
him the new-born when he uncovered her face and, noting her
piquancy and elegancy and beauty and brilliancy and size and
symmetry, his vitals fluttered and he was seized with yearning
sorrow for her fate; and he named her Al-Hayfá<a id="r180"></a><a href="#f180" class="c012"><sup>[180]</sup></a> for her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_126">126</span>seemlihead. Then he gifted the midwife——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King
Al-Mihrjan largessed a robe of honour to the midwife and gifted
her with a thousand gold pieces and went forth from beside his
daughter. Then they committed her to wetnurses and drynurses
and governesses who reared her with the fairest rearing, and after she
had reached the age of four they brought to her divines who lessoned
her in the art of writing and of making selections<a id="r181"></a><a href="#f181" class="c012"><sup>[181]</sup></a> and presently she
approved herself sharp of wits, clever, loquent of tongue, eloquent
of speech, sweet spoken of phrase; and every day she increased
in beauty and loveliness and stature and perfect grace. And when
she reached the age of fourteen she was well read in science and
she had perused the annals of the past and she had mastered
astrology and geomancy and she wrote with caligraphic pen all
the seven handwritings and she was mistress of metres and modes
of poetry and still she grew in grace of speech. Now as her age
reached her fourteenth year her sire the Sultan chose for her a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_127">127</span>palace and settled her therein and placed about her slave-girls,
high-bosomed virgins numbering an hundred, and each and every
famous for beauty and loveliness; and presently she selected of
them a score who were all maidenhoods, illustrious for comeliness
and seemliness. These she taught in verse and poetry and in the
strangenesses of history and in striking instruments of mirth and
merriment until they surpassed all the folk of their day; and she
assiduously enjoined upon them the drinking of wine pure and
new and boon-companionship with choice histories and strange
tales and the rare events of the time. Such was the case with
Al-Hayfa; but as regards her father, King Al-Mihrjan, as one night
he was lying abed pondering what he had heard from the Voice,
suddenly there addressed him a sound without a form and said,
“O King of the Age,” whereat he was fully aroused by sore terror
and his vitals fluttered and his wits were bewildered and he was
perplexed as to his affair. So he took refuge with Allah from
Satan the Stoned and repeated somewhat of the Koran and fenced
himself about with certain of the holy names of Allah the
Munificent; then he would have returned to his couch but was
unable, even to place cheek on pillow. Presently sounded the
Voice a second time, saying, “O King of the Age, O Mihrjan,
verily shalt thou die by reason of her;” and forthwith improvised
the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ho thou! Hear, O Mihrjan, what to thee shall be said ✿ Learn the drift of my words in these lines convey’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Thy daughter, Al-Hayfa (the girded round ✿ With good, and with highest of grade array’d)</div>
      <div class="line">Shall bring with right hand to thee ruin-bowl ✿ And reave thee of realm with the sharp-biting blade.”<a id="r182"></a><a href="#f182" class="c012"><sup>[182]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when Al-Mihrjan had heard what the Voice had spoken of
verse and had produced for him of prose, he was wholly aroused
<span class="pageno" id="Page_128">128</span>from his sleep and became like one drunken with wine who knew
not what he did and his vitals fluttered and increased his cark
and care and anxious thought. So he removed from that site into
another stead and was stirred up and went awandering about. Then
he set his head upon the pillow but was unable to close his eyelids
and the Voice drew nearer and cried upon him in frightful accents
and said, “O Mihrjan, dost thou not hearken to my words and
understand my verse; to wit, that thy daughter Al-Hayfa shall
bequeath to thee shame and thou shalt perish by cause of her?”
Then the Unseen One recited these couplets<a id="r183"></a><a href="#f183" class="c012"><sup>[183]</sup></a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I see thee, O Mihrjan, careless-vain ✿ Who from hearing the words of the wise dost abstain:</div>

      <div class="line">Who shall home thee in grave sans a doubt and she ✿ Shall seize thy kingship and reave thy reign.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">But when Al-Mihrjan had heard the words of the Voice and what
it had urged upon him of poetry and of prose-addresses, he arose
from his rest in haste and anxiety until Allah caused the morn to
morrow and break in its sheen and it shone, whereupon the King
summoned the Mathematicians and the Interpreters of dreams and
the Commentators on the Koran; and, when they came between
his hands, he related to them his vision, fully and formally, and
they practised their several arts, making all apparent to them; but
they concealed the truth and would not reveal it, saying to him,
“Indeed the consequence of thy vision is auspicious.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared

said to King Al-Mihrjan, “Verily the consequence of thy vision is

again I will favour thee with my counsel, ho thou the King!”

me and desire of me!” (Now the folk heard these words spoken
aloud.) Then Al-Mihrjan arose from his sleep joyful and cheerful
and when morning came he summoned the Mathematicians and
Architects and Masons and bade them rebuild the Monastery of
the Archers; so they obeyed his bidding until they had completed
it in the handsomest fashion and with the best of workmanship.
After that the King ordered they construct for his daughter Al-Hayfa
a palace unsurpassed by any edifice and perfectly builded and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_130">130</span>decorated, hard by the river Al-Kawa’ib; moreover that it should be
situate in a wady, a hill-girt plain through which meandered the
stream. So they obeyed his bidding and laid its foundations and
marked with large stones the lines thereof which measured a
parasang of length by a parasang of breadth. Then they showed
their design to the King, who gathering together his army returned
with them to the city. Presently the Architects and Master-masons
fell to building it square of corners and towering in air
over the height of an hundred ells and an ell; and amiddlemost
thereof stood a quadrangular hall with four-fold saloons, one
fronting other, whilst in each was set apart a cabinet for private
converse. At the head of every saloon a latticed window projected
over the garden whereof the description shall follow in its
place; and they paved the ground with vari-coloured marbles and
alabastrine slabs which were dubbed with bezel stones and onyx<a id="r186"></a><a href="#f186" class="c012"><sup>[186]</sup></a>
of Al-Yaman. The ceilings were inlaid with choice gems and
lapis lazuli and precious metals: the walls were coated with white
stucco painted over with ceruse<a id="r187"></a><a href="#f187" class="c012"><sup>[187]</sup></a> and the frieze was covered with
silver and gold and ultramarine and costly minerals. Then they
set up for the latticed windows colonnettes of gold and silver and
noble ores, and the doors of the sitting chamber were made of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_131">131</span>chaunders-wood alternating with ebony which they studded with
jewels and arabesque’d with gold and silver. Also they placed in
each sitting-room a pillar of Comorin lign-aloes and the best of
sandal-wood encrusted with gems; and over the speak-room they
threw cupolas supported upon arches and connecting columns and
lighted in the upper part by skylights of chrystal and carnelian
and onyx. And at the head of each saloon was a couch of juniper-wood
whose four legs were of elephants’ ivories studded with
rubies and over each was let down a hanging<a id="r188"></a><a href="#f188" class="c012"><sup>[188]</sup></a> of golden weft and
a network of gems, whilst higher than the whole was a latticed
casement adorned with pearls which were threaded upon golden
wire and curtains bearing scented satchels of ambergris. The
furniture of the divans was of raw silk stuffed with ostrich-down
and the cushions were purfled with gold. The floors of all the
saloons were spread with carpets and rugs embroidered with
sendal, and in the heart of the Great Hall amiddlemost the four
saloons rose a marble jet-d’eau, square of shape, whose corners
were cunningly wrought and whose floor and marge were set with
gems of every hue. They also placed upon the edges of that
fountain figures fashioned of gold and silver representing all
manner birds and beasts, each modelled according to his several
tint and peculiar form; their bellies too were hollow and from the
fountain was conducted a conduit which led the water into their
insides and caused it gush from their mouths so that they jetted
one at other like two hosts about to do battle. After this the
same water returned to the middle of the fountain and thence
flowed into the gardens, of which a description will follow in its
place.<a id="r189"></a><a href="#f189" class="c012"><sup>[189]</sup></a> Also the walls of the Great Hall were variegated with
wondrous pictures in gold and lapis lazuli and precious materials
<span class="pageno" id="Page_132">132</span>of every kind, and over the doors of the sitting-places they hung
candelabra of chrystal with chains of gold wherein were set jewels
and jacinths and the costliest stones; after which they inscribed
upon the entrance of the speak-rooms couplets to the following
purport:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Clear and clean is our séance from slanderous foe; ✿ And from envious rival whose aim is blame:</div>
      <div class="line">None hither may come save the cup-boy, and eke ✿ Cup-comrades who never our fame defame.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Upon the chandeliers themselves were inscribed these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am raised in reverence high o’er head ✿ For they see that my gift is the boon of light:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m a pleasure to eyesight, so up with you all, ✿ O Seers, and joy ye the joys of my sight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And upon the Palace-door was inscribed the following quatrain:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“This Mansion’s adorned          ✿ As delight to man’s eye;</div>
      <div class="line">O’er its door writ is ’Welcome,’ ✿ So safely draw nigh.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when they had finished this inscription over the doorway,
they went forth from the entrance which stood at the head of the
Great Hall and proceeded to a square of large space abounding in
trees and enjoyable for rills; and they surrounded it with a
fencing-wall built of rough stone which they stuccoed over and
figured with various paintings. Then they planted this garden
with all manner fruit-bearing trees and fragrant herbs and flowers
and firstlings of every kind and hue and they trained the branches
after a wonderful fashion, leading under their shade leats and
runnels of cool water; and the boughs were cunningly dispread so
as to veil the ground which was planted with grains of divers sorts
and greens and all of vegetation that serveth for the food of man.
Also they provided it with a watering wheel whose well was
revetted with alabaster<a id="r190"></a><a href="#f190" class="c012"><sup>[190]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_133">133</span>dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Architects set up in that palace-garden a water-wheel whose well
was revetted with alabaster and whose wood-work and wheel
were of chaunders-wood, whilst its pitchers were of fine porcelain
and its cordage<a id="r191"></a><a href="#f191" class="c012"><sup>[191]</sup></a> was of raw silk. And when they were free of
this work they edified amongst the scented shrubs and blossoms
a towering dome based upon four-square walls of variegated
marbles and alabasters studded with carbuncles<a id="r192"></a><a href="#f192" class="c012"><sup>[192]</sup></a> and its ceiling
was supported upon columns of the finest stone with joinery of
lign-aloes and sandal, and they dubbed its cupola with jewels and
precious stones and arabesque’d<a id="r193"></a><a href="#f193" class="c012"><sup>[193]</sup></a> it with gold and silver. Then
they made therein four saloons more, each fronting other, and
at the head of one and all was a latticed window impending
over the bloomy shrubs and fragrant herbs; the colonnettes of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_134">134</span>those casements were silvern whilst the shutters were of sandal-wood
plated and studded with precious metals; and over the
lintels thereof was an ornamental frieze of gold inscribed with
lines of verse which shall be described in its due place. And
they inlaid that frieze with rubies and jacinths until it made the
cupola resemble the domes of Paradise. Moreover they trained
the flowering shrubs and the perfumed herbs to overrun with
their tendrils the casements in the drum of the dome, and when
they had completed the work and had embellished it with all
adornments they pierced for it an entrance and ranged around
it three ramparts which, built up with large stones, were in
breadth seven cubits. Then they edified for the Palace an
impregnable gateway of Chinese steel whereunto led flights of
alabastrine steps which were continued to the highmost parts, and
lastly they derived the river Al-Kawa’ib till it surrounded the
edifice on every side and encircled it as signet-ring girdeth
finger or wristlet wrist. Now when the Architects and Master-masons
had made an end of building the Palace and its domes
and had finished laying out and planting the parterres, they went
in to King Al-Mihrjan and kissing ground between his hands
informed him thereof; and he, receiving this report, at once took
his daughter, Al-Hayfa, and mounting horse, he and the Lords
of his land rode forth till they reached the river Al-Kawa’ib
which ran at three days’ distance from his capital. When he
arrived there and looked upon the Palace and its elevation in
fortalice-form he was pleased therewith and so were all of his
suite and retinue; whereupon he went up to it and beholding the
ordinance and the ornamentation and the cupolas and the gardens
and the edification and embellishment of the whole, he sent for
the Architects and Master-masons and the artificers whom he
thanked for their work, and he bestowed upon them robes of honour
and gifted and largessed them and assigned to them rations and
pay and allowances. So they kissed ground before him and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_135">135</span>went their ways. Then King Al-Mihrjan and his host withdrew
within the Palace, and he bade serve up the trays of viands
and sumptuous food for a banquet, after which he and his abode
three days in eating and drinking and diversion and disport;
and he gave robes of honour to his Wazirs and Emirs and the
Grandees of his kingdom, and in fine issued orders for their
departure. When they went forth from him, he commanded to
summon Al-Hayfa and her women with all their belongings;
and she, having made act of presence and having ascended to
the Palace and considered it with its beauty and artifice and
ornamentation, was pleased and rejoiced therein. The father
abode with her three days, and then farewelling her returned to
his capital; and she on his departure bade her slave-girls distribute
the couches about the saloons placing in each one a seat
of ebony plated with glittering gold, whose legs were of elephant’s
ivory, and over one and all they reared canopies of silk and
brocade adorned with jewels and precious metals and bespread
them with mattresses and cushions and pillows, and over the
floor of the palaces they laid down carpets whereupon was
orfrayed this couplet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Friend hereon seated be blythe and gay ✿ Unless hereto bound and debarred of way.”<a id="r194"></a><a href="#f194" class="c012"><sup>[194]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then they set upon them settees for seats whereupon were
inscribed these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Seat, be thy beauty increased evermore; ✿ Fair fall thee with happiness choice and meet;</div>
      <div class="line">An I fail in life through my slip and sin, ✿ To-morrow in Heav’n I’ll give thee seat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then<a id="r195"></a><a href="#f195" class="c012"><sup>[195]</sup></a> the attendants decorated the whole Palace until it became
<span class="pageno" id="Page_136">136</span>like unto one of the Mansions of Heaven, and when the women
had done her bidding Al-Hayfa was much pleased, so she took
one of the slave-girls by the hand and walked with the rest of
them around the Palace considering its artifice and its embellishment,
especially the paintings which covered the walls; and they
rejoiced thereat, marvelling at the cunning decorations and they
were grateful to the Architects who had builded and presented all
these representations. And when Al-Hayfa reached the terrace-roof
of the Palace she descended by its long flight of steps which
led to the river-side, and bidding the door be thrown open she
gazed upon the water which encircled it like ring around finger or
armlet round arm, and admired its breadth and its swiftness of
streaming; and she magnified the work and admired the gateway
of steel for its strength and power of defence and sued for
pardon of Almighty Allah.<a id="r196"></a><a href="#f196" class="c012"><sup>[196]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would
relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventieth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night! She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
<span class="pageno" id="Page_137">137</span>and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa
sued pardon of Allah the Great and took refuge with the Almighty
from Satan the Stoned, after which said she, “There is no diverter
to whatso is doomed by the Lord nor availeth aught of solicitude
against that commanded by the Omnipotent, the All-puissant; and
His power is upon me with His destiny and needs must it come
to pass.” Then she called for a pencase of gold and she wrote for
placing over the gateway of the Palace the following couplets:<a id="r197"></a><a href="#f197" class="c012"><sup>[197]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Al-Hayfa had finished her writing and what she had improvised
of verse and couplets, she bade close the entrance of the
Palace and went up, she and her women, to the higher apartments;
and the while she was drowned in thought and fell to saying,
“Would Heaven I knew an this mighty guard and ward will
defend Al-Mihrjan and would I wot if this fortalice will fend off
Fate and what fain must be.” Then she enjoined her women to
high diet and the drinking of wine and listening to intimate converse
and the hearing of songs and musical instruments and
gladness and gaiety for a while of time; and she felt herself safe
from the shifts of chance and change. Such was her case but now
we will recount (Inshallah!) what further befel her.<a id="r200"></a><a href="#f200" class="c012"><sup>[200]</sup></a> In the land
of Sind was a King hight Sahl<a id="r201"></a><a href="#f201" class="c012"><sup>[201]</sup></a> and he was of the Monarchs of
might, endowed with puissance and prepotency and exalted degree,
abounding in troops and guards and overruling all that fair region.
Now Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) had vouchsafed him a son
than whom was none in his age fairer of semblance: beautiful exceedingly
was he, with a face brighter far than the full moon; and he
was of tongue eloquent and of pluck puissant, valorous, formidable.
Also he was mighty fond of wine mere and rare and of drinks in
the morning air and of converse with the fair and he delighted in
mirth and merriment and he was assiduous in his carousing which
he would never forego during the watches of the night or the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_139">139</span>wards of the day. Now for the abundance of his comeliness and
the brilliancy of his countenance, whenever he walked abroad in
the capital he would swathe his face with the Lithám,<a id="r202"></a><a href="#f202" class="c012"><sup>[202]</sup></a> lest wax
madly enamoured of him the woman-kind and all creation, wherefore
he was named the Veiled Yúsuf of Beauty. It chanced one
night as he sat carousing with his boon companions that the wine
prevailed over him and he became sprightly and frolicsome; so
he went forth from the door of his cabinet in a state of drink,
understanding naught and knowing nothing of that he did.
He wandered about the rooms belonging to his father and there
he saw a damsel of the paternal concubines standing at the door of
her bower and his wine so mastered him that he went up to her and
clasped her to his bosom and threw her backwards upon the floor.
She cried aloud to the royal Eunuchs who stood there looking on at
him, not one of them, however, dared arrest him or even draw
near him to free the girl, so he had his will of her and abated her
maidenhead after which he rose up from off her and left her all
bleeding<a id="r203"></a><a href="#f203" class="c012"><sup>[203]</sup></a> from his assault. Now this slave-girl had been gifted to
his sire and Yusuf left her to recover her condition when he would
have visited her again, but as soon as he had returned to his apartment
(and he not knowing what he had done) the Eunuchs took
the damsel (she bleeding as before) and carried her to King Sahl
who seeing her in such case exclaimed, “What man hath done
this to her?” Said they, “’Tis thy son Yusuf;” and he, when he
heard the words of his slaves, felt that this matter was hard upon
him and sent to fetch the Prince. They hastened to bring him,
but amongst the Mamelukes was one lovingly inclined to the youth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_140">140</span>who told him the whole tale and how his father had bade the
body-guards summon him to the presence. And when Yusuf had
heard the words of the Mameluke he arose in haste and baldrick’d
his blade and hending his spear in hand he went down to the
stables and saddled him a steed of the noblest blood and likeliest
strain; then he mounted and, taking with him a score of Mamelukes
his pages, he sallied forth with them through the city gate and
rode on unknowing what was concealed from him in the Secret
Purpose.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive.” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince
Yusuf, son of King Sahl, went forth the city all unknowing
whither he should wend and to what part he should turn, and he
ceased not faring with his merry men for ten full-told days, cutting
across the wold and wild and the valley and the stone-clad hill,
and he was perplext as to his affair. But whilst he was still
journeying he came upon the river Al-Kawa’ib and he drew in
sight of the castle of Al-Hayfa, which stood amiddlemost that
mighty stream with its height and bulk and defensive strength.
Hereupon quoth Yusuf to himself, “By Allah, none founded this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_141">141</span>puissant fortalice in such power and prepotency and forcefulness
save for a mighty matter and a cause of much consequence.
Would Heaven I wot to whom this belongeth and who dwelleth
therein!” Then he applied his mind and had recourse to the
knowledge of his companions the Mamelukes and he commanded
all his white slaves alight upon the marge of the river for the
purpose of rest, and when they had reposed he asked them, “Who
amongst you will go down to this stream and will over-swim it
and will visit the lord of the Castle and bring us news of it and
tidings of its ownership and discover for us the man to whom
it belongeth?” But as no one would return him a reply he
repeated his words without any answer and he, when he saw that,
arose forthright and doffed what he had upon him of dress, all
save his shirt only. Then he took his bow and quiver and placing
his clothes with his weapon and arrow-case upon his head he
went down to the river and swam it until he came forth it on the
further side. Here he walked up to the gateway and found an
impregnable entrance all of steel which none might avail to
open, but when he saw the verses thereon inscribed and understood
their significance he gave himself joy and was certified of
entering. Then he took from his quiver a pen case and paper
whereupon he inscribed these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“At your door, O Fountains of weal, I stand ✿ A stranger from home and a-morning bann’d.</div>
      <div class="line">Your grace shall haply forfend my foe ✿ And the hateful band of unfriends disband:</div>
      <div class="line">I have none resort save your gates, the which ✿ With verse like carcanet see I spann’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Ibn Sahl hath ’spied with you safe repair, ✿ So for lonesome stranger approach command!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Yusuf had ended his writing, he folded the paper and
made it fast to a shaft; then he took his bow and arming it drew
the string and aimed the arrow at the upper terrace, where it
dropped within the parapet. Now, by the decree of The Decreer
<span class="pageno" id="Page_142">142</span>Al-Hayfa was walking there with her women when the shaft fell
between her feet and the paper became manifest, so she caught
sight of it and took it up and opened it, and having read it
understood its significance. Hereat she rejoiced and congratulated
herself and her cheeks flushed rosy-red, and presently she went
hastily in the direction of the entrance, whilst her women still
looked down from the terrace upon the doorway and saw Yusuf
a-foot before it. They cried out to their lady, “Verily there
standeth below a youth lovely in his youthfulness, with his face
gladdening as the crescent moon of Sha’abán.”<a id="r204"></a><a href="#f204" class="c012"><sup>[204]</sup></a> But when
Al-Hayfa heard the words of the women she was glad and gave
herself joy and sensed an oppression of pleasure, whilst her vitals
palpitated and she perspired in her petticoat trowsers.<a id="r205"></a><a href="#f205" class="c012"><sup>[205]</sup></a> Then
she went down to the gateway which she bade be thrown open,
and seeing Prince Yusuf she smiled in his face and welcomed
him and greeted him. He returned her salam with sweetness of
phrase and softness of words, when said she to him, “Well come
and welcome and good cheer to thee, O thou who dost visit us
and takest refuge in our demesne<a id="r206"></a><a href="#f206" class="c012"><sup>[206]</sup></a> and in our presence, for that
here thou hast immunity and impunity and civility;” presently
adding, “Enter into this guarded stead and feel thou no fear
from any foe, for thou has wrought thy wish and hast attained
thine aim and hast won thy will, O fair of face and O perfect of
form, O thou whose countenance excelleth the new moon: here
thou hast preserved thy life and art saved from foeman’s strife.”
Thereupon she mounted the staircase and he behind her, while
the slave-girls surrounded the twain, and she conversed with him
and cheered him with fair words and welcomed him once more
till they had entered the Castle saloon, when she took his hand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_143">143</span>and seated him at the head of the hall. But as Yusuf looked
upon the portalice and the beauty of its building and the
excellence of its ordinance and the high degree of its decorations
which made it like unto the Palaces of Paradise, and as he beheld
that furniture and those couches, with what was over them of
hangings, and the gems and jewels and precious metals which
abounded there, he magnified the matter in his mind and said to
himself, “This place belongeth to none save to a mighty monarch!”
Then Al-Hayfa bade her women bring a bundle of clothing, and
when they had set it between her hands, she opened it and drew
forth a suit of Daylakian<a id="r207"></a><a href="#f207" class="c012"><sup>[207]</sup></a> garments and a caftan of Coptick stuff
(fine linen of Misraim purfled with gold), and bestowed them
upon him, and she bound around his head an or-fringed Shásh<a id="r208"></a><a href="#f208" class="c012"><sup>[208]</sup></a>
with either end gem-adorned. And when he donned the dress
his countenance became brilliant and its light shone afar, and
his cheeks waxed red as rose, and she seeing this felt her wits
bewildered and was like to faint. However, she soon recovered
herself and said, “This is no mortal: verily he is naught but of
the Húrs of Heaven.” Then she bade her women bring food——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was
the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
<span class="pageno" id="Page_144">144</span>the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa bade
her women bring the food trays, and when they obeyed her bidding
and placed them between the hands of Yusuf, he considered
them and saw that one was made of Yamání onyx and another of
red carnelian and a third of rock chrystal, and they bore platters
of gold and silver and porcelain and jasper. Upon them were
ranged dishes furnished with the daintiest food which perplexed
the wits, and sweetmeats and sumptuous meats, such as gazelle’s
haunch and venison and fatted mutton and flesh of birds, all the big
and the small, such as pigeon and rock-pigeon, and greens marinated
and viands roasted and fried of every kind and colour and cheeses
and sugared dishes. Then she seated Yusuf beside her and
served him with all manner cates and confections and conjured
him to fall-to and morselled him until he had eaten his sufficiency;
after which they twain sat together in laughter and enjoyment
each conjoined to other and both cast in the mould of beauty
and loveliness and brilliancy and stature and symmetric grace as
though in the likeness of a rattan-palm. All this and Al-Hayfa
rejoiced in Yusuf, but ever and anon she took thought anent her
sire King Al-Mihrjan and his works and she kept saying in her
mind, “Would Heaven I wot will he wed me to this youth so
charming of inner grace; and, if my father be not satisfied therewith,
I will marry my lover in despite of him.” And the while Yusuf
quoth to himself, “Would Heaven I wot how my sire will act in
the business of the concubine whose pucelage I did away, and
would Heaven I knew if he have ridden forth in search of me, or
he have lost sight of me and never asked of me.” On this wise
either of the twain spoke to themselves, and neither of them believed
in safety, all unknowing what was predestined to them by Him
who saith to a thing, “Be” and it becometh. So Al-Hayfa and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_145">145</span>Yusuf sat drowned in the depths of thought, withal their joyance
and enjoyment made them clean forget that writ for them by
Fate; and the Prince gazing upon the greater tray saw graven
upon its edge these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“For the gathering of friends and familiars design’d ✿ Between hands of Kings and Wazirs I’m shrin’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Upon me is whatever taste loves and joys ✿ Of flesh and viands all kinds combin’d:</div>
      <div class="line">From me fill thee full of these cates and praise ✿ Thy Lord, the Maker of all mankind.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then the attendants placed bread upon the trays, and the Prince
found writ in moulded letters upon the loaves the couplets that
follow:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“And a loaf new-born from the flour of wheat, ✿ White and piping hot from the oven-heat:</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth to me my chider, Be wise and say ✿ Soothe my heart and blame not, O friend I greet.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently the handmaidens piled upon the trays platters of silver
and porcelain (whereof mention hath been made) containing all
that lip and tongue gratify of the meat of muttons in fry and
Katá-grouse and pigeon-poults and quails and things that fly of
every kind and dye which hungry men can long to espy, and
Yusuf saw inscribed upon the china dishes the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Platters of china fair     ✿ That all men’s eyne ensnare,</div>
      <div class="line">None seeth in this our town ✿ China of mould so rare.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he looked upon the silver plate and found it graven with
these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Plate worked in silver of the brightest white ✿ In height of beauty, O thou joy to sight,</div>
      <div class="line">When fully finisht and when perfect made ✿ Becometh chargers peerless in delight.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And portrayed upon the porcelain were all that grow and fly of
geese and poultry. Anon a handmaid brought in hand a knife
<span class="pageno" id="Page_146">146</span>wherewith to carve the meats, and Yusuf looking at the blade
saw upon it letters gold-inlaid and forming these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am blade of finest grain     ✿ Wherefrom comes naught of bane:</div>
      <div class="line">Fro’ my friends all harm I ward ✿ And thy foes by me be slain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Hereupon the handmaids ended the ordinance of the table and
set everything in its own stead; after which the Princess took
seat beside the Prince and said to him, “O my lord, hearten our
heart and deign grace to us and honour us by eating with us:
this indeed be a day of joy for my union with thee and for thy
lighting this my lodging with the splendour of thy semblance so
bright and thy beauty so rare and for thine alighting at my home
and thine opportune kindness and thine inner graciousness,<a id="r209"></a><a href="#f209" class="c012"><sup>[209]</sup></a> O thou
unique one of the Age and the Time, and O thou who hast no
peer in our day and our tide.” Now when Yusuf heard the words
of Al-Hayfa he said to her, “Walláhi, O thou who the moons
adornest and who the sun and the daylight shamest, O lady of
brow flower-bright and of stature elegant-slight, O thou who
passest in beauty and comeliness all mortal beings, O thou with
smile like water sweet and mouth-dews like purest spring and of
speech the softest, I wot thou art the lady of goodness and excellence
and generosity and liberality.” Then she again fell to
morselling the Prince until they both had a sufficiency of food,
whereupon she bade them fetch water for washing their hands
after meat. And they brought to Yusuf a basin of glittering gold,
when he rejoiced with exceeding exultation the while he was sunk
in meditation, and at times he gazed upon Al-Hayfa and his wits
were bewildered and his senses seduced him to something he would
do with her for the abundance that was in her of beauty and
loveliness. But his reason forbade to him his passion, and quoth
he in his mind, “To everything its own time,”——And Shahrazad
<span class="pageno" id="Page_147">147</span>was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to
say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Yusuf said,
“To everything its own time, and soothly sayeth the old saw,
Whoso hurrieth upon a matter ere opportunity consent shall at last
repent.” Now when they brought the basin before him and therein
stood an ewer of chrystal garnished with gold, he looked at it and
saw graven thereupon the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I’m a Basin gold beautifies ✿ For the hands of the great and the wise:</div>
      <div class="line">Abased<a id="r210"></a><a href="#f210" class="c012"><sup>[210]</sup></a> for the cleansing of palms, ✿ Washing hands with the water of eyes.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Thereat he considered the ewer and saw inscribed upon it these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O rare the Ewer’s form whereon must dote ✿ Our hearts and pupils of our eyes fain gloat:</div>
      <div class="line">Seems ferly fair to all admiring orbs ✿ You seemly body wi’ the slender throat.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when he had finished washing his hands and had dried them
with the napkins he pointed at them and spoke these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_148">148</span>“Groweth my love a-heart and how to hide ✿ When o’er the plains of cheek tear-torrents glide?</div>
      <div class="line">I veil what love these sobs and moans betray ✿ With narrowed heart I spread my patience wide.</div>
      <div class="line">O Farer to the fountain,<a id="r211"></a><a href="#f211" class="c012"><sup>[211]</sup></a> flow these eyes ✿ Nor seek from other source to be supplied:</div>
      <div class="line">Who loveth, veil of Love his force shall reave, ✿ For tears shall tell his secrets unespied:</div>
      <div class="line">I for the love of you ain bye-word grown, ✿ My lords, and driven to the Desert-side;</div>
      <div class="line">While you in heart of me are homed, your home; ✿ And the heart-dweller kens what there may bide.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Prince Yusuf had finished his improvisation and the poetry
which he produced, Princess Al-Hayfa bussed him upon the brow,
and he seeing this waxed dazed of his wits and right judgment
fled him and he fell fainting to the floor for a while of time. And
when he came to himself he pondered how she had entreated him
and his Passion would have persuaded him to do with her somewhat
but Reason forbad and with her force he overcame himself.
After his improvising Al-Hayfa again saluted him on the front and
cried, “Indeed thou hast done well in thy words, O thou with
Crescent’s brow!” Presently she came for the table of wine and
filling a cup drank it off; then she crowned another goblet and
passed it to Yusuf who took it and kissed it while she improvised
some couplets as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thy seduction of lips ne’er can I forbear ✿ Nor deny love-confession for charms so rare:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou aim of my eyes, how my longing stay? ✿ O thou tall of form and long wavy hair?</div>
      <div class="line">Thy rose-hued cheek showeth writ new-writ<a id="r212"></a><a href="#f212" class="c012"><sup>[212]</sup></a> ✿ Dimming wine my cups in thei rondure bear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And presently she added:<a id="r213"></a><a href="#f213" class="c012"><sup>[213]</sup></a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_149">149</span>“I hid his phantom, by the Lord, but showed ✿ My looks the blush his scented cheek had sent:</div>
      <div class="line">How veil the joy his love bestows, when I ✿ To blood-red<a id="r214"></a><a href="#f214" class="c012"><sup>[214]</sup></a> tears on cheek give open vent,</div>
      <div class="line">When his uplighted cheek my heart enfires ✿ As though a-morn in flame my heart were pent?</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, ne’er my love for you I’ll change ✿ Though change my body and to change consent.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Al-Hayfa had finished her improvisation and her
poetry, Yusuf drained the goblet and after kissing it returned it to
her; but he was as one a-swoon. Then she took it from him and
he recovered and presently declaimed for her the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“A maiden in your tribe avails my heart with love to fire<a id="r215"></a><a href="#f215" class="c012"><sup>[215]</sup></a> ✿ And how can I a hidden bear the love my eyes declare?</div>
      <div class="line">The branches of the sand-hill tree remember and recall ✿ What time she softly bent and showed a grace beyond compare;</div>
      <div class="line">And taught me how those eyne o’erguard the roses of her cheek ✿ and knew to ward them from the hand to cull her charms would dare.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_150">150</span>As soon as Yusuf had finished his improvisation and what of
poetry he had produced, Al-Hayfa took seat by his side and fell
to conversing with him in sweetest words with softest smiles, the
while saying, “Fair welcome to thee, O wonder of beauty and
lovesome in eloquence and Oh charming in riant semblance and
lord of high degree and clear nobility: thou hast indeed illumined
our place with the light of thy flower-like forehead and to our
hearts joyance hast thou given and our cares afar hast thou driven
and eke our breasts hast made broad; and this is a day of festival
to laud, so do thou solace our souls and drain of our wine with us
for thou art the bourne and end and aim of our intent.” Then
Al-Hayfa took a cup of chrystal, and crowning it with clear-strained
wine which had been sealed with musk and saffron, she passed it
to Prince Yusuf. He accepted it from her albeit his hand trembled
from what befel him of her beauty and the sweetness of her poetry
and her perfection; after which he began to improvise these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou who drainest thy morning wine ✿ With friends in a bower sweet blooms enshrine—</div>
      <div class="line">Place unlike all seen by sight of man ✿ In the lands and gardens of best design——,</div>
      <div class="line">Take gladly the liquor that quivers in cup ✿ And elevates man, this clean Maid of the Vine:</div>
      <div class="line">This goblet bright that goes round the room ✿ Nor Chosroës held neither Nu’uman’s line.</div>
      <div class="line">Drink amid sweet flowers and myrtle’s scent ✿ Orange-bloom and Lily and Eglantine,</div>
      <div class="line">And Rose and Apple whose cheek is dight ✿ In days that glow with a fiery shine;</div>
      <div class="line">’Mid the music of strings and musician’s gear ✿ Where harp and pipe with the lute combine;—</div>
      <div class="line">An I fail to find her right soon shall I ✿ Of parting perish foredeemed to die!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Al-Hayfa responded to him in the same rhyme and measure
and spake to him as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou who dealest in written line ✿ Whose nature hiding shall e’er decline;</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_151">151</span>And subdued by wine in its mainest might ✿ Like lover drunken by strains divine,<a id="r216"></a><a href="#f216" class="c012"><sup>[216]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">Do thou gaze on our garden of goodly gifts ✿ And all manner blooms that in wreaths entwine;</div>
      <div class="line">See the birdies warble on every bough ✿ Make melodious music the finest fine.</div>
      <div class="line">And each Pippet pipes<a id="r217"></a><a href="#f217" class="c012"><sup>[217]</sup></a> and each Curlew cries ✿ And Blackbird and Turtle with voice of pine;</div>
      <div class="line">Ring-dove and Culver, and eke Hazár, ✿ And Katá calling on Quail vicine;</div>
      <div class="line">So fill with the mere and the cups make bright ✿ With bestest liquor, that boon benign;—</div>
      <div class="line">This site and sources and scents I espy ✿ With Rizwán’s garden compare defy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Al-Hayfa had ended her improvisation and what she
had spoken to him of poetry, and Yusuf had given ear to the
last couplet, he was dazed and amazed and he shrieked aloud and
waxed distraught for her and for the women that were beside
and about her, and after the cry he fell fainting to the ground.
But in an hour<a id="r218"></a><a href="#f218" class="c012"><sup>[218]</sup></a> he came to, when the evening evened and the
wax candles and the chandeliers were lighted, his desire grew
and his patience flew and he would have risen to his feet and
wandered in his craze but he found no force in his knees. So
he feared for himself and he remained sitting as before.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
<span class="pageno" id="Page_152">152</span>compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Yusuf remained
sitting as before, Al-Hayfa asked him saying, “How art thou
hight, O dearling of my heart and fruit of my vitals?” Hereupon
he told her his name and the name of his sire, and related
to her the whole of what had befallen him, first and last, with the
affair of the concubine and his faring forth from his own city and
how he had sighted her Palace and had swum the stream and shot
the shaft that carried the paper, after which he recited to her
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I left my home for a fair young maid ✿ Whose love my night with its light array’d;</div>
      <div class="line">Yet wot I not what her name may be ✿ Thus ignorance mating with union forbade.</div>
      <div class="line">But when of her gifts I was certified ✿ Her gracious form the feat easy made;</div>
      <div class="line">The King of Awe sent my steps to her ✿ And to union with beauty vouchsafed me aid:</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed disgrace ever works me shame ✿ Tho’ long my longing to meet I’m afraid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Al-Hayfa heard his name her great love to him waxed
greater. Then she took the lute upon her lap and caressed it with
her finger-tips when it sighed and sobbed and groaned and moaned<a id="r219"></a><a href="#f219" class="c012"><sup>[219]</sup></a>
and she fell to singing these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_153">153</span>“A thousand welcomes hail thy coming fain, ✿ O Yúsuf, dearling son of Sahl’s strain:</div>
      <div class="line">We read thy letter and we understood ✿ Thy kingly birth from sand that told it plain:<a id="r220"></a><a href="#f220" class="c012"><sup>[220]</sup></a></div>
      <div class="line">I’m thine, by Allah, I the loveliest maid ✿ Of folk and thou to be my husband deign:</div>
      <div class="line">Bruit of his fair soft cheek my love hath won ✿ And branch and root his beauty grows amain:</div>
      <div class="line">He from the Northern Realms to us draws nigh ✿ For King Mihrján bequeathing ban and bane;</div>
      <div class="line">And I behold him first my Castle seek ✿ As mate impelled by inspiration fain.</div>
      <div class="line">The land upstirs he and the reign he rules ✿ From East to West, the King my father slain;</div>
      <div class="line">But first he flies us for no fault of ours ✿ Upon us wasting senseless words and vain:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when Yusuf heard the words of Al-Hayfa he rejoiced with
exceeding joy and she was gladdened in like manner, after which
he gifted her with all that was upon him of gear and in similar
guise she doffed what dress was upon her and presented it to him.<a id="r222"></a><a href="#f222" class="c012"><sup>[222]</sup></a>
Then she bade the slave girls bring her an especial suit and they
fetched her a second bundle and she clothed Yusuf with what was
therein of sumptuous clothes. After this the Prince abode with
Al-Hayfa as an inmate of her palace for a term of ten days in all
the happiness of life, eating and drinking and enjoying conjugal
intercourse.<a id="r223"></a><a href="#f223" class="c012"><sup>[223]</sup></a> Presently Almighty Allah (be He extolled and
exalted!) decreed that, when all tidings of Yusuf son of Sahl
were lost, his sire sent in search of him Yahyà,<a id="r224"></a><a href="#f224" class="c012"><sup>[224]</sup></a> his cousin and the
son of his maternal aunt, amongst a troop of twenty knights to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_154">154</span>track his trail and be taught his tidings until Allah (be He
glorified and magnified!) guided him to the pages who had been
left upon the river-bank. Here they had tarried for ten days
whilst the sunshine burnt them and hunger was exterminating
them; and when they were asked concerning their lord, they gave
notice that he had swum the stream and had gone up to yonder
Castle and had entered therein. “And we know not (they ended)
whether he be alive or dead.” So the lord Yahya said to them,
“Is there amongst you any will cross the current and bring us
news of him?” but not one of them would consent and they
remained in silence and confusion. So he asked them a second
time and a third time yet none would rise up before him and
hearten him to attempt the dangers of the stream, whereupon he
drew forth his ink case of brass and a sheet of paper and he fell
to writing the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“This day I have witnessed a singular case ✿ Of Yúsuf scion to Sahl’s dear race:</div>
      <div class="line">Since he fared at undurn his sire was grieved ✿ And the Palace remained but an empty place:</div>
      <div class="line">I liken the youth to full moon ’mid stars ✿ Disappearing and darkening Earth’s bright face.</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis my only fear that his heart is harmed, ✿ Brent by Love-fires lacking of mercy and grace:</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, albeit man’s soul thou rule ✿ Among stranger folk thou art but an ace!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Presently he took a reed and grasping it thrust thereinto the
twisted and folded paper, after which he stopped the hole with
wax; then, lashing it to the surface of the shaft, he set it upon the
bow-handle and drew the string and shot the bolt in the direction
of the Castle, whither it flew and fell at the foot of the staircase
beside the main entrance. It so fortuned at that time a slave-girl
came forth to fill her pitcher with water and she found the
arrow and picked it up and carried it to her lady who was sitting
in the speak-room at converse with Yusuf. Hereupon the Prince
<span class="pageno" id="Page_155">155</span>hent the reed in hand and broke it and drew forth the paper which
he opened and read and comprehended. Hereupon he wept with
exceeding great weeping until he fell to the floor a-faint and the
Princess took the note from his grasp and perused it, and it was
hard upon her, so she bade them beat the slave-girl who brought
the writ with an hundred blows and they bastinadoed her till
she lost her senses. But when Yusuf recovered, he thought of his
pages and his people and his homestead and his family and he
cried to Al-Hayfa, “Wallahi, I have sinned with a great sin when
I left my suite in the desert; and Satan garred me forget them
and the wine made me mindless of them and banished from my
thought my folk and my home. And now ’tis my desire to fare
and look upon my pages and to forgather with Yahya my cousin,
the son of the King’s sister and greet them and dismiss them to their
homesteads, after which I will return to thee forthright.” Quoth
she, “By Allah, I may not patient myself away from thee a single
hour otherwise shall my spirit depart my body, and I conjure thee
by the Almighty that thou bid me return to them a reply!”
Quoth Prince Yusuf, “What news wilt thou give them? An thou
say that I never came to thee none will believe; for indeed my
pages saw me passing into thy Palace”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
<span class="pageno" id="Page_156">156</span>love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince
Yusuf said to the Princess Al-Hayfa, “Indeed my pages saw me
passing into the Palace and have given him<a id="r225"></a><a href="#f225" class="c012"><sup>[225]</sup></a> tidings to that effect.”
And she responded to him with fairest response and tenderness of
terms and gem-like verse. Then she took her ink-case and paper
and a brazen pen and would have written but he forbade her, saying
by way of deprecation, “This be not the right rede! An thou
return a reply my slaves will take it and will bear it to my native
country and will inform the folk of all our adventure: ’tis better
far that I fare to them myself and greet them and going with them
to my own country satisfy my sire, after which I will return to thee
in hottest haste. And do not thou on this wise, for we fear lest
our affair be made public and this our case be reported to thy royal
father, and it prove hard to him by reason that all such talk in the
case of the Kings is to them mighty grievous. Moreover, when he
shall be acquainted with the truth he will either transport thee to
his presence or he shall place over this Palace guards who may
forbid thee from me and forbid me from thee, and this shall be a
cause of our separation each from other.” But Al-Hayfa shrieked
aloud when she heard these words and wept and wailing said, “O
my lord, prithee take me with thee, me and my handmaids and all
that be in this my Palace.” Said he, “I will not delay from thee
save for the space of my wayfare an I live and Allah Almighty
preserve me.” Hereat she wept with loud weeping and groaned,
and love-longing surged up in her and she fell to repeating the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Rain, O mine eyeballs, gouts of blood beshed ✿ From clouds of eyelids e’en as grass turns red.</div>
      <div class="line">O mighty bane that beatest on my bones ✿ And oh heart-core, that melts with fire long-fed!</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_157">157</span>My soul’s own dearling speedeth on his march ✿ Who can be patient when his true love sped?</div>
      <div class="line">Deal kindly with my heart, have ruth, return ✿ Soon to my Castle nor be long misled.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Al-Hayfa had ended her verse, Yusuf wept with sore
weeping and cried, “By Allah, I had intended to return to thee
after I had fared to them and had settled the matter in hand. But
suffer me dismiss those who have come for me and seek reunion with
thee, Inshallah—an it be the will of Allah Almighty.” Then he
farewelled her and doffed what he had of dress, and when Al-Hayfa
asked him, “Wherefore take off these clothes?” he answered<a id="r226"></a><a href="#f226" class="c012"><sup>[226]</sup></a> “I
will not inform anyone of our news, and indeed this dress mostly
befitteth womenkind.” Then he went forth from her with a grief-bound
heart and she wept and cried, “Help! Help!”<a id="r227"></a><a href="#f227" class="c012"><sup>[227]</sup></a> and all
her women shrieked and shed tears over parting with him. But
as soon as Yusuf passed out of the palace-door he took off the
gown which was upon him and turband’d it around his head
together with his bow and quiver, and he stinted not to stem the
stream until he had reached the further bank where he found and
greeted the lord Yahya and his Mamelukes. They all kissed his
hand, and his cousin enquired of him, “What is the cause of thy
disappearing from these thy men for a space of ten days?” He
replied, “By Allah, O son of my aunt, when I went up to yonder
Palace, I found there a Youth of the sons of the kings, who welcomed
and greeted me as a guest and honoured me with the
highmost honour and favoured me with the fullest favour. But
when I would have taken leave of him, the air smote me<a id="r228"></a><a href="#f228" class="c012"><sup>[228]</sup></a> and fell
upon my loins and laid me up so that I feared to swim the stream
<span class="pageno" id="Page_158">158</span>and the unease that was upon me increased, and such is the reason
of my delaying away from you.” Then he took horse together
with Yahya and the pages, and they all sought their homes and
cut across the wilds and the wastes and the vales and the
stony hills until they drew near to their destination and their city
rose clear before eyes of them. As soon as they reached it the tidings
were told to King Sahl<a id="r229"></a><a href="#f229" class="c012"><sup>[229]</sup></a> who made ready for faring forth, he and
the lords of his land, to meet and greet his son and heir Yusuf;
and meanwhile he bade decorate the capital with the choicest
decorations and ornaments and adornments. The lieges gave one
another joy of their Prince’s safe return, and clothed their city in
gala-guise, and the father having met the son alighted from his
steed and embraced him and kissed him between the eyes, and
personally conducting him up to the Palace did him due honour
and largessed him; and so great and lasting was their joy that the
day of arrival became high holiday. As soon as night fell, Prince
Yusuf repaired to his own Palace where he was met by his mother
and his women who were as full moons a-rising; and the spouses
numbered three, besides forty concubines. However he turned
away from them and he lay alone that night moaning even as
moaneth the dove for the loss of her mate; and he regarded not
one of those wives and lemans, and he passed the dark hours in
brooding over the loss of his beloved, and in weeping and in the
reciting of poetry,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Yusuf passed
the night weeping and improvising verse, but he let not fall a word
of explanation fearing lest he divulge his secret; and his spouses
supposed that he was wroth with his sire and knew not what there
was in his vitals of exceeding desire to Al-Hayfa. But when
brake the day he was roused and gazing upon the rise of awaking
Dawn he pondered the happy mornings which had passed; so he
wept and complained and moaned like the culver and he fell to
reciting these couplets:——</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“No joy but you in house and home I know ✿ Save bitter heart and tears that ever flow;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor with mine eyes I view aught save yourselves ✿ Whenas in lowe of love-desire I glow:</div>
      <div class="line">My heart enjoys but gust and greed for you, ✿ Mine eyelids own no joy save wake and woe:</div>
      <div class="line">O blaming me for them, avaunt, by God ✿ Nor leave me fancy-free, worst gift of foe!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Yusuf has finished his poetry he fell into a fainting fit
and he quivered as quivereth the fowl with cut throat,<a id="r230"></a><a href="#f230" class="c012"><sup>[230]</sup></a> and he came
not to himself save when the sun had arisen arraying the lowlands
with its rays. Then he waxed wood and sat with eyes at the ground,
a-gazing and not accosting anyone nor answering aught, and lastly
he took to his pillow. These tidings presently reached the King
his father, who accompanied by the Lords of his land came to him
<span class="pageno" id="Page_160">160</span>and after greeting him said, “O my son, whom I would ransom
with my life, what contagion hath come upon thee of disease,
and whereof dost thou complain?” Quoth he, “O my father, the
air hath struck me and hath cut my joints,”<a id="r231"></a><a href="#f231" class="c012"><sup>[231]</sup></a> and quoth his father,
“O my son, Almighty Allah vouchsafe ease thee of this thy
disease.” Then the King mounted and went forth from him, and
sent a leach which was a Jew<a id="r232"></a><a href="#f232" class="c012"><sup>[232]</sup></a> of wits penetrating and sagacious.
The man went in to him, and sitting beside him felt his joints and
asked him of his case; but he held his peace nor would return
aught of reply. So the Israelite knew that he was a lover and in
the depths of love bedrowned; accordingly he left him and told the
King that the Prince had no complaint save that he was a hot
amourist and distraught of vitals. Hereupon his mother came to
Yusuf and said, “O my son, fear Almighty Allah for thy soul, and
have some regard for thy wives and concubines and yield not to
thy passions which will mislead thee from the path of Allah.”
But he deigned not answer her. In this condition he remained
until three days sped, taking no taste of meat or drink, nor finding
pleasure in any stead, nor aught of rest a-bed. Presently he bade
summon a Mameluke of the Mamelukes Hilál hight, and asked
him, “O Hilal, say me wilt thou be my companion in travel?”
whereto the other answered, “Yea, verily, O my lord, to hear is
to obey thee in all thou devisest and desirest.” Hereupon the
Prince bade him saddle a steed of the purest blood, whose name
was “<em>The-Bull-aye-ready-and-for-Battle-day-steady</em>,”<a id="r233"></a><a href="#f233" class="c012"><sup>[233]</sup></a> a beast which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_161">161</span>was a bye-word amongst the folk. The Prince waited until the
first third of the night had gone by when he mounted the courser
and placed Hilal his Mameluke upon the crupper, and they cut
once more the wilds and the wastes until they sighted hard-by the
river Al-Kawa’ib and the Castle of Al-Hayfa rising from its waters.
Hereupon Yusuf fell to the ground in a swoon, and he when he
recovered said to Hilal, “Do thou ungirth the horse’s saddle and
hide it within the cave amid the rocks;” and the Mameluke did as
he was bidden and returned to him. Herewith Prince Yusuf turband’d
himself with his clothes and those of his man, and backing
the horse bade Hilal hang on by its tail, then the beast breasted
the stream and ceased not swimming with them until it reached
the farther side. There Yusuf dismounted and knocked at the door
when a confidential handmaid established in the good graces of her
mistress,<a id="r234"></a><a href="#f234" class="c012"><sup>[234]</sup></a> came down and threw it open, after which she embraced
him and kissed his hands and his breast and his brow between the
eyes. Then she ran up and informed thereof her lady who with
wits bedazed for excess of joy hurried down to him and threw her
arms round his neck, and he threw his arms round hers, and she
clasped him to her bosom, and he clasped her to his, and he kissed
her and she kissed him, and they exchanged accolades, after which
they both of them fell fainting to the floor until the women who
stood by thought that they had been reaped by Death, and that
their latest hour had been doomed. But when they recovered
from their swoon they complained and wept, each lamenting to
other the pains of parting, and lastly she asked him concerning
Hilal, and he answered, “This is a Mameluke of the number of my
Mamelukes.” So she marvelled how two men had come upon one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_162">162</span>horse,<a id="r235"></a><a href="#f235" class="c012"><sup>[235]</sup></a> and quoth she to him, “O Yusuf, thou hast indeed tortured
me with thine absence;” and quoth he to her, “By Allah (and
beside Him God there is none!) my hand never touched or woman
or aught of feminine kind or of she-Jinn or Jinn kind, but in
me desire for thee ever surged up, and wake and in vitals a fiery
ache.” Then the Princess bade her handmaids wend with Hilal in
a body to the garden, and when they obeyed her bidding she arose
and walked forth with Yusuf.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting, and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa
walked forth with Yusuf and led him to the saloon of session where
they passed their day in privacy, he and she, and right joyous was
the joy of them twain. After this the Prince abode with her thirty
full-told days in merriment prime and pleasure and wine. But
when that time had elapsed, she said to him, “O light of my eyes,
do thou arise and go up with me to the highmost post of the
Palace that we may look upon this flow of stream and command
a view of these mounts and mountains and these wilds and valleys
<span class="pageno" id="Page_163">163</span>wherein wander the gazelles.” Thereupon the twain fared together
and solaced themselves with the spectacle of the antelopes browsing
on the desert growth, when quoth Al-Hayfa, “Ah, O my lord,
would I had for captive one of these herding roes to keep
beside me in the Palace,” and quoth he, “By the rights of thine
eyes, and the night of their pupils, I indeed will fill the place with
them.” Hereupon he went forth from her in haste, albeit she hung
on to him and forbade him from that, and she invoked upon herself
a mighty strong invocation, yet would he not be stayed, but taking
his horse and saddling it he left his Mameluke Hilal in the Castle
and swam the stream upon his steed, and rode through the wold in
quest of the gazelles. He ceased not chasing them till he had
taken three,<a id="r236"></a><a href="#f236" class="c012"><sup>[236]</sup></a> which he tied fast and slung upon his courser and rode
back until he had reached the river-bank, and Al-Hayfa sat looking
at him as he pounced upon and snatched up the roes from his
courser’s back like a lion and she wondered with extreme wonderment.
But when he had made sure of his place on the water-side
and purposed returning to the palace, lo and behold! he saw a
batel<a id="r237"></a><a href="#f237" class="c012"><sup>[237]</sup></a> manned by sundry men coming towards him down-stream
from the direction of his capital. Now Al-Hayfa, who was in her
bower, expected the craft to be sent, bearing rarities and presents,
by her sire King Al-Mihrjan; and Yusuf, when he looked upon
its approach, was certified that it came from her father. So he
delayed going down to the river till he had seen what action might
be taken by the batel, but when the Princess sighted it she made
sure of its coming from her sire, so she bade bring paper for note
and a pen of brass wrought wherewith she wrote in verse and lastly
indited to Yusuf these couplets:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my need, thou hast left me a-field to fare ✿ When come is a craft which our men doth bear:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_164">164</span>I deem she be sent by Al-Mihrján ✿ And it bringeth of provaunt a goodly share:</div>
      <div class="line">So loiter a little, then back to us ✿ And obey my bidding, O Beauty rare.”<a id="r238"></a><a href="#f238" class="c012"><sup>[238]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she made fast the paper to a shaft and setting it upon a
bow-handle drew the string aiming high in air, and the arrow fell
between the feet of the Prince, who seeing it took it up and read
the writ and comprehended its meaning and full significance.
So he hung back and he turned to wandering amongst the
mountains, but anon he said in himself, “There is no help but
that I discover this matter.” Then he dismounted from his steed
and stabled it in a cave hard-by, and having loosed the antelopes
he propped himself against a rock and fell to gazing upon the
batel, which ceased not floating down until it made fast at the
Palace gate. Hereupon there issued from it a youth, singular of
comeliness, whom Al-Hayfa greeted and embraced, and forthright
led within her Palace. Presently came forth from the batel
the four pages that were therein, and amongst them was a man
hight Mohammed ibn Ibráhím, one of the King’s cup-companions,
whereas the youth she had embraced was her cousin, named
Sahlúb, the son of her maternal aunt. But when Yusuf looked
upon this lover-like reception, his wits were wildered and the
sparks started from his eyes, and he deprecated and waxed
care-full and indeed he was like one Jinn-mad, and he cried,
“Walláhi, I will stay away from them this night and see whatso
they do.” Now Al-Hayfa had left her trusty handmaid at the
Palace gate, saying to her, “Tarry here alone: haply Yusuf shall
return during the dark hours, when do thou open to him the
door.” Then she returned to her guests and bade serve the table
of wine and seated Sahlub and Ibn Ibrahim, and took seat
between them after she had hidden the Mameluke Hilal in a
closet and she had disposed of the pages about the Palace-sides.
Then they fell to drinking wine. Such was the case with these;
<span class="pageno" id="Page_165">165</span>but as regards Yusuf, he took patience until the dark hours drew
near, when he swam the stream and he came forth it to the Palace-door,
at which he knocked a light knock. Hereupon the porter-handmaiden
opened to him and he accosted her and questioned
her concerning her lady, and was told that she was sitting with
her cousin and the prime favourite and cup-companion of her
sire. So quoth he to the girl, “Say me, canst thou place me in
some commanding place that I may look upon them?” and she
did accordingly, choosing a site whence he might spy them
without being espied. He gazed at them as one distraught,
while Al-Hayfa engaged them in converse and improvised verse
to them; and this was so distressful to him that at last he asked
the slave-girl, “Say me, hast thou by thee ink-case and paper?”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating,
that Prince Yusuf took from the handmaid the pen case and
paper, and waxing void of sense through jealousy, fell to writing
the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Indeed I deemed you of memory true ✿ And our hearts as one that had once been two;</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_166">166</span>But I found to my sorrow you kept no pact: ✿ This much and you fain of unfaith I view.</div>
      <div class="line">Ill eye ne’er looketh on aught but love ✿ Save when the lover is hater too.</div>
      <div class="line">You now to another than us incline ✿ And leave us and homeward path pursue;</div>
      <div class="line">And if such doings you dare gainsay, ✿ I can summon witness convicting you;</div>
      <div class="line">To the Lion, wild dogs from the fount shall drive ✿ And shall drink themselves, is none honour due.</div>
      <div class="line">That I’m not of those who a portion take ✿ In love, O Moslems, I know ye knew.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">This done, he folded the paper and gave it to the slave-girl
crying, “Say me, dost thou know where be Hilal?” and as she
replied “Yes,” he told her to fetch him. So she went and brought
him, and when he came his lord dismissed the girl on some
pretext; then he opened the Castle-door and turband’d himself
with his gear and that of his Mameluke, and the twain went
down to the river and swam the stream until they reached the
other side. When they stood on terra firma, the Prince found
his horse and saddled and mounted him, taking Hilal upon the
crupper, and rode forth to his own country. Such was the case
with Yusuf; but as regards Al-Hayfa, when she awoke a-morn,
she asked of her lover and her handmaid handed to her the
letter; so she took it and read it and mastered its meaning and
significance, after which she wept with excessive weeping until
she fainted and the blood issued from her eyes. Presently she
came to herself and dismissed Sahlub and his companions; then
she said to Ibn Ibrahim, “Rise thou and depart our presence;
haply some wight may come to us and swim the stream and pass
into the Palace.” But Ibn Ibrahim remained behind while
Sahlub departed with those about him; and when they had left
the company, Al-Hayfa asked, “O Ibn Ibrahim, say me, canst
thou keep my secret and my being fascinate<a id="r239"></a><a href="#f239" class="c012"><sup>[239]</sup></a> by love?” and he
answered, “Yea, verily, O my lady, how should I not conceal
<span class="pageno" id="Page_167">167</span>it for thee, when thou art my mistress and princess and the
daughter of my master, even though I keep it inside mine eyes?”
So she continued, “O Ibn Ibrahim, there came to me a youth
named the Veiled Yusuf of Beauty, son of King Sahl, Sovran
of Sind; and I waxed enamoured of him and he waxed enamoured
of me, and he abode with me two score of days. One day of
the days, quoth I to him:—Come up with me to the Palace-roof
that we may gaze upon the view, when we saw from its height
a herd of gazelles, and I cried:—Ah that I had one of these!
Hereat said he, By Allah, and by the life of thine eyes and by
the blackness of their pupils, I will in very deed fill thy Palace
therewith; and with such words he went forth and saddled his
steed and swam the river to the further side, where he rode down
three roes within sight of me. Then I looked city-ward up stream
and saw a batel cleaving the waters, whereby I knew that my
father had sent me somewhat therein; so I wrote to the Prince
and shot the paper bound to a shaft and bade him hide away
from your faces until ye should have departed. So he concealed
himself within a cave where he tethered his horse, then he sought
tidings of me, and seeing my cousin Sahlub, he was seized by
jealousy. So he lingered till yesternight, when he again swam
the stream and came to the Palace where I had posted Rádih,
the handmaid, bidding her take seat beside the door lest haply
he should enter; and presently she opened to him and he sought
a place commanding a sight of us, and he saw me sitting with
you twain, and both of you were carousing over your wine. Now
this was sore to him; so he wrote to me yonder note, and taking
his Mameluke with him, fared forth to his own folk; and my
desire is that you hie to him.”<a id="r240"></a><a href="#f240" class="c012"><sup>[240]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad was surprised

she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth Al-Hayfa
to Ibn Ibrahim, “I devise that thou hie to Yusuf with this letter;”
whereto quoth he, “Hearkening is obedience: I will, however,
take this thy writ and wend with it first to my own folk, after
which I will mount my horse and fare to find him.” So she
largessed him with an hundred gold pieces and entrusted to him
the paper which contained the following purport in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“What state of heart be this no ruth can hoard? ✿ And harm a wretch to whom none aid accord,</div>
      <div class="line">But sobs and singulfs, clouds that rain with tears ✿ And seas aye flowing and with gore outpour’d;</div>
      <div class="line">And flames that rage in vitals sickness-burnt ✿ The while in heart-core I enfold them stor’d.</div>
      <div class="line">Yet will I hearten heart with thee, O aim! ✿ O Ravisher, O Moslems’ bane ador’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Ne’er did I look for parting but ’twas doomed ✿ By God Almighty of all the lords the Lord.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Mohammed Ibn Ibrahim took the paper and Al-Hayfa said
to him, “Ho thou! Inform none that thou wast sitting beside me
on that night.” Then he went forth until he drew near his folk
<span class="pageno" id="Page_169">169</span>and there he mounted a she-dromedary and pushed her pace until
he arrived at the capital of Sind. He asked for the son of the
King; and when they had directed him thereto he entered and
found the Prince in privacy; so he kissed hands and gave him the
writ which he took and opened and read. But when he had
comprehended its object and purport, he turned and returned it
with stern regards until he had well nigh torn it to tatters. Then
he threw it to Ibn Ibrahim who said to him, “O lord of the Time
and the Tide, ’tis not on this wise that the sons of the Kings cast
away an address without returning aught of reply.” Quoth he,
“There is no response from me,” and quoth Ibn Ibrahim, “O
King of the Age, pity that thou mayest be pitied!”<a id="r241"></a><a href="#f241" class="c012"><sup>[241]</sup></a> Hereupon
the Prince called for pen-case and paper of note and pen of
brass wrought<a id="r242"></a><a href="#f242" class="c012"><sup>[242]</sup></a> and wrote in reply to her poetry the following
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Al-Hayfá with verses a-tip of tongue ✿ Comes suing mercy for love so strong:</div>
      <div class="line">She hath no mercy fro’ me, but still ✿ She pleadeth a plea that our love was long:</div>
      <div class="line">She falsed, turned face, doubted, recked her naught ✿ And her hard false heart wrought me traitor’s wrong:</div>
      <div class="line">Were my heart now changèd her love to woo ✿ She with quick despisal my heart had stung:</div>
      <div class="line">Were my eyne to eye her, she’d pluck them out ✿ With tip of fingers before the throng:</div>
      <div class="line">Soft and tranquil life for her term she seeks ✿ While with hardness and harshness our souls are wrung.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Yusuf folded the paper and handed it to Ibn Ibrahim and
ordered him a robe of honour and an hundred dinars. So he
took them and rode forth until he drew near the Palace of Al-Hayfa,
when he tethered his dromedary and hid her in a cave
whose mouth he walled with stones. Then he went down to the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_170">170</span>river and swam it till he reached the other side; and entering
into the presence of Al-Hayfa he drew forth the paper and committed
it to her. But she, after perusing it, wept with sore
weeping and groaned until she swooned away for excess of tears
and for the stress of what had befallen her. Such was the effect
of what she had read in the letter, and she knew not what might
be the issue of all this affair and she was perplext as one drunken
without wine. But when she recovered she called for pen-case and
paper, and she wrote these improvised couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Lord of folk, in our age alone ✿ And O Raper of hearts from the bonny and boon:</div>
      <div class="line">I have sent to thee ’plaining of Love’s hard works ✿ And my plaint had softened the hardest stone:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art silent all of my need in love ✿ And with shafts of contempt left me prone and strown.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And after she had ended writing she folded her note and gave it
to Ibn Ibrahim who took it, and cried to his slaves, “Saddle my
she-dromedary,” after which he mounted and fared until he had
made the city of Sind. Then he repaired to Yusuf and after
greetings handed the letter to him, but the Prince after perusing
it<a id="r243"></a><a href="#f243" class="c012"><sup>[243]</sup></a> threw it in his face, and presently rose and would have left
him. But Ibn Ibrahim followed him and heard him say to his
pages, “Send him back without beating him,” and they did
accordingly, after forbidding him the place. So he again bestrode
his she-camel and ceased not pushing on till he arrived at the
Palace of Al-Hayfa where he presented himself in her presence.<a id="r244"></a><a href="#f244" class="c012"><sup>[244]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_171">171</span>But when he handed to her the writ she found it was that very
same she had sent to the Prince, so she wept and sorrow was sore
upon her and presently she cried, “O Ibn Ibrahim! what’s to
do?” He replied, “When I delivered thy writ to him, he brake
its seal and read it and threw it in my face: then he rose in wrath
from beside me, and as I followed he bade his slaves and pages
drive me away, adding:—I have for her nor answer nor address;
and this was all he did.” When the Princess heard his words,
she felt the matter to be grievous, and she wept unknowing how
she should act, and fainted for awhile, and when she recovered
she said, “O Ibn Ibrahim, what is this affair and on what wise
shall I behave? Do thou advise me in my case; and haply joy
shall come to me from thy hand, for that thou be a Counsellor of
the Kings and their boon-companion.” “O my lady,” he replied,
“do thou not cut off thy tidings from him and haply shall
Almighty Allah change his heart from case to case and peradventure
insistance overcometh hindrance.”<a id="r245"></a><a href="#f245" class="c012"><sup>[245]</sup></a> Quoth she, “Had
he sent me a reply I had been rightly directed as to what
I should write, but now I wot not what to indite, and if
this condition long endure I shall die.” “Address him again,”
answered he, “and I will fare back once more and fain would
I ransom thee with my life, nor will I return without a
reply.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Six Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ibn Ibrahim
said to Al-Hayfa, “Do thou write to him and there is no help but
that I return to thee with a reply, albe life depart from me.”
Then she asked for pen-case and paper and thereon indited the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ah would thou knew what I of parting dree ✿ When all my hiddens show for man to see;</div>
      <div class="line">Passion and longing, pine and lowe o’ love ✿ Descend surchargèd on the head of me:</div>

      <div class="line">Then, O my lord, an come thou not right soon ✿ The tomb shall home me for the love of thee.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when she had written her reply, she largessed Ibn Ibrahim
with an hundred dinars, after which he returned<a id="r248"></a><a href="#f248" class="c012"><sup>[248]</sup></a> to the capital of
Sind, where he found Yusuf issuing forth to hunt; so he handed
to him the letter, and the Prince returning citywards set apart for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_173">173</span>him a fair apartment and spent the livelong night asking anent
Al-Hayfa. And when it was morning he called for pen-case and
paper whereupon he wrote these improvised couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“You dealt to us a slender dole our love mote satisfy, ✿ Yet nor my gratitude therefor nor laud of me shalt gain:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m none of those console their hearts by couplets or by verse ✿ For breach of inner faith by one who liefly breaks the chain:</div>
      <div class="line">When so it fortunes she I love a partner gives to me ✿ I wone in single bliss and let my lover love again:</div>
      <div class="line">Take, then, what youth your soul desires; with him forgather, for ✿ I aim not at your inner gifts nor woo your charms I deign:</div>
      <div class="line">You set for me a mighty check of parting and ill-will ✿ In public fashion and a-morn you dealt me bale and bane:</div>
      <div class="line">Such deed is yours and ne’er shall it, by Allah satisfy ✿ A boy, a slave of Allah’s slaves who still to slave is fain.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Prince Yusuf robed Ibn Ibrahim in a robe of green; and
giving him an hundred gold pieces, entrusted him with the letter
which he carried to Al-Hayfa and handed it to her. She brake
the seal and read it and considered its contents, whereupon she
wept with sore weeping which ended in her shrieking aloud; and
after she abode perplext as to her affair and for a time she found
no sweetness in meat and drink nor was sleep pleasant to her for
the stress of her love-longing to Yusuf. Also her nature tempted
her to cast herself headlong from the terrace of the Palace; but
Ibn Ibrahim forbade her saying, “Do thou write to him replies,
time after time; haply shall his heart be turned and he will return
unto thee.” So she again called for writing materials and indited
these couplets, which came from the very core of her heart:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Thou art homed in a heart nothing else shall invade; ✿ Save thy love and thyself naught shall stay in such stead;</div>
      <div class="line">O thou, whose brilliancy lights his brow, ✿ Shaped like sandhill-tree with his locks for shade,</div>
      <div class="line">Forbid Heaven my like to aught else incline ✿ Save you whose beauties none like display’d:</div>
      <div class="line">Art thou no amongst mortals a starless moon ✿ O beauty the dazzle of day hath array’d?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c017"><span class="pageno" id="Page_174">174</span>These she committed<a id="r249"></a><a href="#f249" class="c012"><sup>[249]</sup></a> to Ibn Ibrahim who rode again on his route
and forgathered with Prince Yusuf and gave him the letter, whose
contents were grievous to him; so he took writing materials and
returned a reply in the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Cease then to carry missives others write, ✿ O Son of Ibrahim, shun silly plight:</div>
      <div class="line">I’m healed of longing for your land and I ✿ Those days forget and daysters lost to sight:</div>
      <div class="line">Let then Al-Hayfá learn from me I love ✿ Distance from her and furthest earthly site.</div>
      <div class="line">No good in loving when a rival shows ✿ E’en tho’ ’twere victual shared by other wight;</div>
      <div class="line">These modes and fashions never mind arride ✿ Save him unknowing of his requisite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then he entrusted the writ to Ibn Ibrahim, after giving him an
hundred dinars, and he fared forth and ceased not faring till he
had reached the palace of the Princess. Presently he went in and
handed to her the writ, and as soon as she had read it, the contents
seemed to her sore and she wept until her vitals were torn with
sobs. After this she raised her hand<a id="r250"></a><a href="#f250" class="c012"><sup>[250]</sup></a> heavenwards and invoked
Allah and humbled herself before him and said, “My God, O my
Lord, do Thou soften the heart of Yusuf ibn Sahl and turn him
mewards and afflict him with love of me even as thou hast
afflicted me with his love; for Thou to whatso Thou wishest canst
avail, O bestest of Rulers and O forcefullest of Aiders.” Anon
she fell to writing and indited these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Love rules my bosom and a-morn doth moan ✿ The Voice, ah Love, who shows strength weakness grown!</div>
      <div class="line">His lashes’ rapier-blade hath rent my heart; ✿ That keen curved brand my me hath overthrown:</div>
      <div class="line">That freshest cheek-rose fills me with desire; ✿ Fair fall who plucketh yonder bloom new-blown!</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_175">175</span>Since love befel me for that youth did I ✿ Begin for charms of him my pride to own:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou my hope, I swear by Him did share ✿ Love and decreed thou shouldst in longing wone,</div>
      <div class="line">In so exceeding grief why sight I thee ✿ Jacob made Joseph by the loss of me?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She then handed the letter to Ibn Ibrahim, after giving him an
hundred dinars; and he returned forthright to the city of Sind
and, repairing to Yusuf, gave him the writ which he took and read.
Hereupon the Prince waxed sore sorrowful and said to himself, “By
Allah, indeed Al-Hayfa cleaveth to love.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Prince Yusuf
said, “By Allah, had Al-Hayfa any save myself she had not sent
me these letters; but the outgoings of the heart conciliate lovers
and correspond each with other.” Then he took writing materials
and after thinking awhile he improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou of stature fair with waist full slight<a id="r251"></a><a href="#f251" class="c012"><sup>[251]</sup></a> ✿ Surpassing sandhill-branch and reedlet light;</div>
      <div class="line">I deal in words and gems of speech that melt, ✿ By none ’mid all of mortal kind indite;</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_176">176</span>From my tribe’s lord, a lion rending foes ✿ Moon of Perfections and ’The Yusuf’ hight:</div>
      <div class="line">Homed in thy home I joyed my joys with maids ✿ High-breasted,<a id="r252"></a><a href="#f252" class="c012"><sup>[252]</sup></a> virgins weakening forceful sprite;</div>
      <div class="line">Your songs and touch of lute ’mid trembling wine ✿ Consoled all sorrows, made all hearts delight,</div>
      <div class="line">Till you to other deignèd union grant ✿ And I your nature learnt and learnt aright,</div>
      <div class="line">Whereat my vitals failed, sore bane befel, ✿ Pine, disappointment, and injurious blight.</div>

      <div class="line">How many a maiden deckt with crescent brow ✿ Hath nature dealing injury and despite?</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Yusuf had ended his poetry he presented an hundred
dinars to Ibn Ibrahim, who took the letter and fell to cutting
through the wilds and the wolds, after which he went in to the
presence of Al-Hayfa and gave her the missive. She wept and
wailed and cried, “O Ibn Ibrahim, this letter is indeed softer than
all forewent it; and as thou hast brought it to me, O Ibn Ibrahim,
I will largesse thee with two honourable robes of golden brocade
and a thousand dinars.” So saying, she called for pen-case and
paper whereupon she indited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my lord, these words do my vitals destroy, ✿ O thou gem of the earth and full moon a-sky!</div>
      <div class="line">How long this recourse to denial and hate ✿ With heart whose hardness no rocks outvie?</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast left my spirit in parting-pangs ✿ And in fires of farness that flame on high:</div>
      <div class="line">How long shall I ’plain of its inner pains? ✿ Haps thy grace shall grant me reunion-joy:</div>
      <div class="line">Then pity my vitals and whatso homed ✿ Thy form within me before I die.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c017"><span class="pageno" id="Page_177">177</span>She then handed the paper to Ibn Ibrahim who again set out and
sought the Prince and kissed his hand and gave him the letter;
whereupon said he, “O Ibn Ibrahim, come not thou again bringing
me aught of missive—ever or any more after this one.” Quoth Ibn
Ibrahim, “Wherefore, O my lord, shall I not do on such wise?”
and quoth Yusuf, “Suffer her to learn the fates of menkind.”
Said the other, “I conjure thee, by Allah Almighty, ho thou
the King, inasmuch as thou art of the seed of mighty monarchs,
disappoint her not of her question; and Allah upon thee, unless
thou show pity to her heart it haply will melt away with melancholy
and love and madness for thy sake; and all of this is for
the truth of her affection.” Hereupon Yusuf smiled and taking
up his pen wrote these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Stay thy tears; for hindrance and parting hie, ✿ And the endless of Empire aye glorify:</div>
      <div class="line">From my core of heart fly all cark and care ✿ After parting that seemèd all Time defy.</div>
      <div class="line">A Lion am I for the love of him ✿ Whom the slanderer’s part ne’er can satisfy:</div>
      <div class="line">My mind and soul be this day with you ✿ But my heart and thought are at enmity:</div>
      <div class="line">Thought and mind delight in Love’s cruelty ✿ While heart and soul for reunion cry:</div>
      <div class="line">And if mind and thought e’er can overcome ✿ Soul and heart, Re-union thou ne’er shalt ’spy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Yusuf had finished his writing, he gifted Ibrahim with
an hundred dinars and sent him again to Al-Hayfa with the letter,
and she on receiving it shed tears and said, “O Ibn Ibrahim,
seeing that his soul and heart be with us, Allah Almighty availeth
to turn his thoughts and his fancy and the mind of him.” Hereupon
she took writing materials and wrote:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Calm, O my lord, thy vitals’ painful plight, ✿ O thou whose semblance lighteth sooty night:</div>

      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_178">178</span>O high in honour passing height of Kings, ✿ O thou with purest blood ’mid Kings bedight,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then she passed her missive to Ibn Ibrahim giving him an hundred
gold pieces and he pushed his pace till he reached the city of Sind,
where he went in to Yusuf and kissed his hands and feet. The
Prince taking the letter smiled and laughed and said, “O Ibn
Ibrahim, when Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) shall decree
my faring I will fare to them<a id="r256"></a><a href="#f256" class="c012"><sup>[256]</sup></a> within a short while; but do thou
return and let know that I intend forgathering with them.” Quoth
the other, “Ah! O my lord, do thou indite her a reply, otherwise
she will have no trust in me;” so the Prince fell to penning these
lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My vitals restless bide for very jealousy ✿ The while my heart must ever show unfriendly gree:</div>

      <div class="line">And I have heard my lover drives me forth from him ✿ But Allah grant my prayer of benedicite.</div>
      <div class="line">In anxious care I came and sought your side this day ✿ Naught shall the youth exalt save generosity.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Then Prince Yusuf passed the letter to Ibn Ibrahim who, after
receiving his hundred dinars, repaired to Al-Hayfa and greeted
her<a id="r257"></a><a href="#f257" class="c012"><sup>[257]</sup></a> informing her the while that her lover was about to make
act of presence.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
<span class="pageno" id="Page_179">179</span>quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on

said to Al-Hayfa, “Verily Yusuf purposeth to visit thee after a
little while.” But when the Princess heard his words she would
not believe him albeit her heart palpitated with pleasure; whereupon
Ibn Ibrahim improvised to her as follows:—</p>

    <div class="group">

      <div class="line">Love pledged me his word he would see thee and said, ✿ Hie thee home and order the house aright.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Ibn Ibrahim had ended his verse, Al-Hayfa joyed with
increased and exceeding joy, and in her delight she answered him
according to the rhyme and rhythm of his verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O who spreadest clouds,<a id="r258"></a><a href="#f258" class="c012"><sup>[258]</sup></a> Son of Ibrahim hight; ✿ By the Lord who ruleth in ’Arshhis height,</div>

      <div class="line">So hold me not like the most of mankind, ✿ Who joy the fair ones to twit and flyte.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Al-Hayfa had finished her verses, Ibn Ibrahim brought
out to her the letter of the Prince, and as soon as she read it her
heart was comforted and she waxed glad with exceeding gladness
and she bade them present him with largesse of value great and a
thousand dinars upon a china plate. After this she took him by
the hand and led him into a closet and said, “O Ibn Ibrahim, all
that be in this cabinet is a free gift to thee when thou shalt have
brought to me that lover of mine.” Such was the case with them;
but as regards Prince Yusuf, when Ibn Ibrahim left him, he felt
love-lowe aflaming in his heart, and he summoned his Mameluke
Hilal and said to him, “Go saddle for us the steed known by the
name of The Bull-aye-ready-and-for-Battle-day-steady.” Hereupon
the slave arose and enselled the courser and Yusuf mounted;
and, taking his Mameluke on the crupper, pushed his pace (and he
madly in love with Al-Hayfa), and he ceased not faring till he
reached her Palace. He then swam the stream with his Mameluke
hanging on, as before, to the tail, and knocked at the door which
was opened by a damsel hight Nuzhat al-Zaman<a id="r261"></a><a href="#f261" class="c012"><sup>[261]</sup></a> and she
on recognising him kissed his hands and hurrying to her lady
informed her of his coming. Al-Hayfa hearing of the arrival fell
<span class="pageno" id="Page_181">181</span>fainting to the ground and when she recovered she found Yusuf
standing beside her head; so she arose and embraced him for a
long while, after which she improvised and said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou Pilgrim of Love, after parting far ✿ From us driven by malice of jealous foe!</div>
      <div class="line">My life for the friend in affection comes; ✿ Naught dearer to me than such boon can show;</div>
      <div class="line">Full many a writ have I written thee ✿ Nor union nor grace of return I know.</div>
      <div class="line">In this world I see him with single heart ✿ O my wish! and Allah ne’er part us two.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when she had ended her verses she bade the slave-girls convey
Ibn Ibrahim and Hilal to the gardens, after which she led Yusuf
to the saloon of session and the twain passed the night together
he and she, in joyance and enjoyment, for that night was indeed a
night of delight. But when Allah bade the morn to morrow,
Al-Hayfa arose and cried, “How short it is for a night: Ah that
it had been longer for us! but ’tis for me to say even as said Imr
al-Kays<a id="r262"></a><a href="#f262" class="c012"><sup>[262]</sup></a> in sundry of his verses upon a similar theme:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“On me Night waxeth long nor would I shorten Night; ✿ Yet hasteth Morn when I for longer Nights would sue:</div>
      <div class="line">It brings me union till ’My lover’s mine’ I cry ✿ Yet when with him unite disunion comes to view.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when it was the second day, Al-Hayfa took seat in the
assembly of converse.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Al-Hayfa repaired to
the saloon of séance, she and Yusuf, and summoned Ibn Ibrahim
and bade the handmaids bring everything that was in the closet.
They obeyed her bidding and fetched her all the contents, amongst
which were ten robes of honour and three coffers of silk and fine
linen and a packet of musk and a parcel of rubies and pearls and
jacinths and corals and similar objects of high price. And she
conferred the whole of this upon Mohammed ibn Ibrahim, the
while improvising these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“We are noblest of lords amongst men of might; ✿ What we give and largesse bring the most delight:</div>

      <div class="line">I am none who riseth sans bounteous deed; ✿ I am none who giveth with felon sprite.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Al-Hayfa had ended her poetry, Prince Yusuf largessed<a id="r263"></a><a href="#f263" class="c012"><sup>[263]</sup></a>
Ibn Ibrahim and said to him, “Thou shalt have on my part one
thousand dinars and twenty robes of brocade and an hundred
she-camels and eighty horses (whereof the meanest is worth five
hundred gold pieces and each is saddled with a golden selle), and
lastly forty handmaids.” After which he began to improvise
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_183">183</span>“Good signeth man to sight and all men see ✿ Sahl’s son is lord of liberality:</div>

      <div class="line">Whoso hath moneys lacking liberal mind ✿ Though he snatch Fortune ’mid the vile is he.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Yusuf had finished his verse, Ibn Ibrahim arose and
bussed his hands and feet and cried, “Allah dole to thee all thou
desirest.” The other replied, “When thou shalt return to our
city, do thou go to my quarters and therefrom take thee whatso I
have promised.” Then the Prince and Princess waxed assiduous
in the eating of meat and the drinking of wine; and this continued
for many successive months<a id="r264"></a><a href="#f264" class="c012"><sup>[264]</sup></a> until Ibn Ibrahim craved leave to
visit his folk; and, when he received permission, he took with him
that was light in weight and weighty of worth. And as he set
forth, Al-Hayfa said to him, “When thou shalt return to thy
people in safety, do thou salute for me my sire and name to him a
certain stallion which same he shall largesse to thee and likewise
its saddle and bridle.” Hereupon he farewelled them and went
forth and stemmed the stream and withdrawing his she-dromedary
from the cave harnessed her and mounted her and set forth upon
his desert way, and as soon as he reached the capital of Sind he
went to his folk who greeted him kindly. Now when King Al-Mihrjan
heard of Mohammed ibn Ibrahim’s coming he sent to
summon him and as soon as he appeared between his hands he
asked concerning his absence. “O King of the Time and the
Tide,” quoth he, “I have been in Yathrib<a id="r265"></a><a href="#f265" class="c012"><sup>[265]</sup></a> city;” and indeed he
was one of the cup-companions of Al-Hayfa’s father and by the
decree of Destiny he had been ever in high favour with the King.
So the twain sat down to drink wine and as Fortune willed it Ibn
<span class="pageno" id="Page_184">184</span>Ibrahim bore about him a letter containing poetry, part of the
correspondence between the Prince and Princess, wherein were
written the names of all three. Now when he was at the height
of his joy he wagged his head and shook off his turband and the
paper fell therefrom into Al-Mihrjan’s lap.<a id="r266"></a><a href="#f266" class="c012"><sup>[266]</sup></a> The King took it and
read it and understood its contents but he kept the case secret
for a while; presently, however, he dismissed his Courtiers and
Equerries who were around him and forthright bade smite
Mohammed ibn Ibrahim with stripes until his sides were torn.
Then quoth he, “Acquaint me concerning this youth who correspondeth
with my daughter, making thee the goer between them
twain, otherwise I will cut off thy head.” Quoth Ibn Ibrahim,
“Ho thou the King; verily this be only poetry which I found in
one of the histories of old.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——“With love and
good will!” It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that Ibn Ibrahim said to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_185">185</span>Al-Mihrjan, “Verily I found this poetry in a tale of the olden
time.” So the King issued orders to smite his neck, when intercession
was made for him by a Courtier hight Tá’il al-Wasf,<a id="r267"></a><a href="#f267" class="c012"><sup>[267]</sup></a>
whereupon the King commanded him to jail, whither he was taken
forthright. But as Ibn Ibrahim was being locked up, he said to
the gaoler, “Say me, canst thou bring for me a pen-case and paper
and pen?” and the other assented, fetching for him whatso he
wanted. So he wrote to Prince Yusuf the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Yúsuf, master mine, for safety fly; ✿ In sorest danger Ibrahim’s son doth lie:</div>
      <div class="line">When from thy side for house and home he sped ✿ Forthright bade Al-Mihrjan to bring him nigh,</div>
      <div class="line">And ’mid th’ Assembly highest stead assigned ✿ A seat in public with a sleight full sly.</div>
      <div class="line">A writ thou wrotest bore he on his head ✿ Which fell and picked it up the King to ’spy:</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis thus discovered he thy state and raged ✿ With wrath and fain all guidance would defy.</div>
      <div class="line">Then bade he Ibrahim’s son on face be thrown ✿ And painful beating to the bare apply;</div>
      <div class="line">With stripes he welted and he tare his sides ✿ Till force waxed feeble, strength debility.</div>
      <div class="line">So rise and haste thee to thine own and fetch ✿ Thy power, and instant for the tribe-lands hie;</div>
      <div class="line">Meanwhile I’ll busy to seduce his men ✿ Who hear me, O thou princely born and high;</div>
      <div class="line">For of the painful stress he made me bear ✿ The fire of bane I’ve sworn him even I.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when Ibn Ibrahim had finished his verse, he said to the gaoler,
“Do thou summon for me the son of my brother hight Manná’<a id="r268"></a><a href="#f268" class="c012"><sup>[268]</sup></a>
and thou shalt have from me one hundred gold pieces.” The man
did his bidding, and when the youth came the uncle gave him
the letter and bespake him as follows: “O son of my brother,
take thou this paper and fare with it to the Castle of Al-Hayfa
<span class="pageno" id="Page_186">186</span>and swim the stream, and go up to the building and enter
therein and commit this missive unto a youth whom thou shalt
see sitting beside the Princess. Then do thou greet him with the
salam from me, and inform him of all that I am in and what I
have seen and what thou hast witnessed, and for this service I will
give thee an hundred gold pieces.” The nephew took the uncle’s
letter and set forth from the first of the night until he drew nigh
the Castle. Such was the case with Ibn Ibrahim and his sending
his nephew Manna’ on a mission to the Princess; but as regards
King Al-Mihrjan, when the morning morrowed and showed its
sheen and shone and the sun uprose with rays a-lowland strown,
he sent to summon Ibn Ibrahim; and, when they set him between
his hands, he adjured him saying, “O thou! by the rights of the
God unique in his rule for Unity; by Him who set up the skies
without prop and stay and dispread the Earths firmly upon the
watery way, unless thou inform me and apprise me rightly and
truly I will order thy head to be struck off this very moment.”
So the cup-companion related to the King the whole affair of
Princess Al-Hayfa and Prince Yusuf, and all that had passed
between the twain; whereupon Al-Mihrjan asked, “And this
Yusuf from what land may he be?” “He is son to the Sovran
of Sind, King Sahl,” quoth the other, and quoth Al-Mihrjan,
“And is he still in the Palace, or hath he gone to his own
country?” “He was therein,” replied Ibn Ibrahim, “but I
know not whether he be yet there, or he be gone thence.” Hereupon
Al-Mihrjan commanded his host at once to mount, and all
took horse and rode forth making for the Castle of Al-Hayfa.
Now, between Manna’ and King Al-Mihrjan was a march of only
a single night, when the youth went up to the Palace of the
Princess, where he knocked at the door and they opened and
admitted him to the presence of Prince Yusuf. There he handed
to him the letter, which the Prince opened and read; then he
suddenly rose up crying upon Hilal, whom when he was fetched
<span class="pageno" id="Page_187">187</span>he bade forthwith bring out his steed. Hereat cried Al-Hayfa,
“I ask thee by Allah, O my lord, what may be the news?” and he
answered her, “Verily when Ibn Ibrahim fared from us to his folk
he was summoned on his arrival by thy sire, and he went to
him and informed him of all that hath befallen us, first and last.”
So saying he put the letter into her hands, and she having read it
exclaimed, “O my lord, do thou take me with thee lest haply he
slay me.” Answered the Prince, “O end and aim of mine every
wish, we have naught with us save this one steed who availeth
not to carry three; therefore will thy father overtake us upon the
road and will put us to death one and all. Now the rede that is
right be this, that thou conceal thyself somewhere in the Palace
and charge the slave-girls when thy sire shall come hither, to tell
him that I have carried thee off to mine own country, and for the
rest be thou assured that I will tarry away from thee but a few
days.” So saying Yusuf took his horse with him and Hilal his
page a-crupper and swam the river and made for his own land
pushing his pace, and presently he drew within sight of the capital.
Such was the case of Prince Yusuf, son to King Sahl; but as
regards the matter of King Al-Mihrjan and his host, he ceased not
marching them till such time as he came within sight of the Castle
of his daughter Al-Hayfa; and this was soon after the departure
of Yusuf. And when he had led hither his host, which was like
unto a dashing sea, he dismounted upon the river-bank that all
might free themselves of their fatigue, after which he summoned
Sahlub and bade him swim the stream and walk up to the Castle
and knock at the door. The youth did as he was bidden, and the
handmaids opened to him and greeted him as he asked for Al-Hayfa——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
<span class="pageno" id="Page_188">188</span>the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Six Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Sahlub
went up to the Palace, he asked of Al-Hayfa, and the slave-girls
told him that a youth had come thither and had taken her away
and had carried her off to his own country. So he returned to
Al-Mihrjan and informed him thereof, when the King took horse
with all his host and pursued Yusuf with uttermost haste and
hurry until there was between the twain less than a day’s march.
But as the Prince drew near his capital on the tenth day he went
in to his sire and told him whatso had befallen him from incept to
conclusion, nor did he hide from him aught; whereupon King
Sahl mustered his many (all who received from him royal solde
and allowances), and bade them take horse with his son Yusuf.
The troops did accordingly and the Prince rode a-van, and after a
little while the two armies met. Now Ibn Ibrahim had made a
compact with five of the nobles who were the chiefest men of King
Al-Mihrjan’s reign and had promised them five hundred thousand
dinars. So when the two hosts were about to engage, an Emir of
the Emirs came forth (and he was one of those whom Ibn Ibrahim
had appointed to watch over Yusuf) and said to the Prince, “O Son
of the King, verily Ibn Ibrahim hath promised five of the nobles
as many hundred thousand dinars of gold the which we may take
and receive from thee.” Replied he, “The like sum shall be
thine from me with all thou canst ask of us.” Presently the Emir
<span class="pageno" id="Page_189">189</span>returned from him to Al-Mihrjan and said to him, “Verily I have
asked this youth that he make vain and void the battle between
us twain, but he assented not and sware an oath that he would
never return from affray until the enemies should meet and fight
it out, and that he had with him a mighty host and a conquering
whose van was not known from its rear.<a id="r269"></a><a href="#f269" class="c012"><sup>[269]</sup></a> Now ’tis my rede that
thou strive to take him prisoner<a id="r270"></a><a href="#f270" class="c012"><sup>[270]</sup></a> and then do whatso he may
please, especially he being son to thee, King of the mighty Kings
and with him a thousand thousand knights all mailed cap-à-pie
and clothed in steel not one of whom hath any fear of fight.”
King Al-Mihrjan waxed wroth at the Emir’s speech and cried,
“What words be these? Shall the Kings of the Age remain
saying of me that a man hath debauched the daughter of Al-Mihrjan
and hath carried her away perforce despite the nose of
her father? Never shall such thing be spoken of me; no, never!
But do thou know, ho thou the Amir, that an ye have no taste
for fray nor avail for fight and ye have no training save for bibbing
of wine and ease at home, I have sworn and swear by Him who
lighted the lucident fires of the Sun and the Moon, none shall
sally forth to do single combat with this youth save I myself.”
But when so saying he knew not that was hidden from him in the
World of Secrets. Presently he rushed into the field of fight with
reins floating upon his courser’s neck and he renowned it, showing
himself between the foremost files, and he played with the edge of
glaive and spit of spear until men’s wits were bewildered and he
improvised the while and cried out the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Ibn Sahl, ho scion of tree abhorr’d! ✿ Rise, meet me in mellay and prove thee lord:</div>
      <div class="line">My daughter hast snatched, O thou foul of deed, ✿ And approachest me fearing the Lion of the horde.</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_190">190</span>Hadst come in honour and fairly sued ✿ I had made her thine own with the best accord;</div>
      <div class="line">But this rape hath o’erwhelmed in dishonour foul ✿ Her sire, and all bounds thou hast overscor’d.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when King Al-Mihrjan finished his verse, Yusuf rushed out
to him, and cried at him with a terrible cry and a terrifying, and
garred his own steed bound upon the battle-plain, where he played
with brand and lance until he cast into oblivion every knight,
reciting in the meantime the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am son to Al-Sahl, O of forbears vile! ✿ Come forth and fight me sans guile or wile;</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast hurt my heart; O of deed misdone, ✿ So thou com’st to contend with this rank and file.”<a id="r271"></a><a href="#f271" class="c012"><sup>[271]</sup></a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">King Al-Mihrjan re-echoed his war-cry, but hardly had he ended
when Yusuf drawing near him answered it with a shout which
enquaked his heart and ravished his reason with sore terror, and
repeated in reply these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“I am not to be titled of forbears vile ✿ O whose ape-like face doth the tribe defile!</div>
      <div class="line">Nay, I’m rending lion amid mankind, ✿ A hero in wilds where the murks beguile.</div>
      <div class="line">Al-Hayfá befitteth me, only me; ✿ Ho thou whom men for an ape<a id="r272"></a><a href="#f272" class="c012"><sup>[272]</sup></a> revile.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Yusuf had ended these words, Al-Mihrjan rushed forth and
charged down upon him, and the two drawing nigh each of the
foemen set on the other with a mighty onset and a prodigious.
They fought in duello and lanced out with lance and smote with
sword, and dashed together as they were two ships or two mountains
clashing; and they approached and retired, and the dust-cloud
<span class="pageno" id="Page_191">191</span>arose over them and they disappeared from men’s sight. But
hardly had an hour passed by when Yusuf made a final attack
upon his enemy and narrowed his course and barred his way and
pressed him hard; and, hanging upon his flank, smote him with the
scymitar upon the nape of the neck<a id="r273"></a><a href="#f273" class="c012"><sup>[273]</sup></a> and caused his head to fall
between his feet, when he slipt from his steed upon the ground,
and he lay stone dead and in his gore drowned. Now as soon as
the folk looked upon Yusuf and what he had dealt to their King
and how he had made his head fly his body and had done him
dead, they turned to take flight. Thereupon Yusuf recognised
Sahlub the cousin of Al-Hayfa, he who had been the cause of
their separation and had roused her wrath against him; so he
drew near to him and smote him with the bright shining blade on
the right flank, and it came forth gleaming between his left ribs;
so he fell to the ground drenched with blood, and he was left
prostrate in the dust. And when Yusuf had slain King Al-Mihrjan
and Sahlub, his nephew, the Grandees of the realm came around
him and greeted him with the salam.——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet

    <div>The Seven Hundredth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_192">192</span>director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Grandees of King Al-Mihrjan’s reign saw their Sovran slain, they
flocked to Prince Yusuf and greeted him, marvelling at his beauty
and valour and excellence: then they all agreed to salute him
as their Sultan and they raised him to the rank of King
and sole ruler over them. Presently they led him with them,
and fared seeking the city of Al-Mihrjan until they reached it,
when they adorned the streets on the occasion of his coming.
And King Yusuf having entered his capital took seat on the throne
of his kingship and bade and forbade and deposed and appointed;
and lastly freed Mohammed ibn Ibrahim from gaol, and established
him his Wazir. Hereupon the new Minister displayed to him the
four wives and the hundred concubines of King Al-Mihrjan, also
his negro slaves, male and female, whom he found to number two
hundred and four hundred. Moreover, he showed his riches and
rarities and treasuries wherein were found an hundred boxes full
of silk and fine linen, and parcels of pearls and rubies and jacinths
and jewels and precious minerals and other wealth in abundance.
So he distributed the whole amongst his nobles, and largessed
them with excessive largesses; and his partisans of his subjects
and his guards flocked to him with presents and offerings; and all
the city-folk gave him joy and rejoiced in him. Then he commissioned
Ibn Ibrahim to Al-Hayfa, daughter of King Al-Mihrjan,
saying, “Do thou bring her hither to me, her and her handmaids
and all that be in her palace.” Accordingly he went forth to Al-Hayfa’s
Castle, and ceased not wending till he came to its entrance
where he discovered that King Yusuf had appointed a craft for
the river transport. And when he arrived there and found the
vessel afloat he went in to Al-Hayfa and he greeted her. Then
he related to her what had betided her sire from Yusuf and how
the Prince had slain him after the fashion of what befel; so she
cried, “There is no Majesty and no Might save in Allah, the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_193">193</span>Glorious, the Great; and this was writ in the Book of Life!”
Then she asked Ibn Ibrahim touching her mother, and he answered
that she was sound and safe in her own home which she had
never left nor did any one go in to her; and, (added he) “she
expecteth thy coming to her.” Then he bade carry down her
impediments and her bondmaids and all the good that was in her
Castle until nothing remained, and embarked them upon the craft;
and presently, mounting her in a litter of sandal-wood plated with
ruddy gold, he set her women in Howdahs;<a id="r274"></a><a href="#f274" class="c012"><sup>[274]</sup></a> and, taking horse
himself, he rode until they drew near the city. And when they
arrived there he went up to King Yusuf whom he informed of
their coming and was told, “Suffer them to be till night shall set
in.” Hereupon he took patience, and when came the appointed
term Al-Hayfa went up to the Palace. Now as Allah caused
the morn to morrow and to light the world with its shine and
sheen, King Yusuf sent to summon the Kazi and witnesses and
bade them write his writ of marriage with Al-Hayfa and was
wedded to her by Book and traditional Usage.<a id="r275"></a><a href="#f275" class="c012"><sup>[275]</sup></a> After this Al-Hayfa
sent to fetch her mother and bore her to her home and their
joy and enjoyment were great and lasting. Now by the decree
of the Decreer anon it befel that the Caliph Al-Maamun waxed
strait of breast one night of the nights: so he summoned a certain
of his courtiers whose name was Ibrahim the Cup-companion;<a id="r276"></a><a href="#f276" class="c012"><sup>[276]</sup></a>
but, as they found him not, he bade bring a man hight Al-Khadí’a,
and when he came between his hands quoth he to him “’Tis a
while since I have seen thee here.” Quoth the other, “O Commander
of the Faithful, I have been wayfaring about the land of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_194">194</span>Syria.” Continued the Prince of True Believers, “Do thou this
very night broaden the Caliph’s heart with a delectable tale;” and
the other rejoined, “O Viceregent of Allah upon Earth, know
thou an adventure befel me with a youth named the Veiled Yusuf
of Beauty, son to King Sahl, the friendly ruler of Al-Sind, and with
Al-Hayfa the daughter of King Al-Mihrjan, and ’tis a tale whose
like hath never been heard; no, never.” Hereupon he related to
Al-Maamun the history of the two, first and last, adding, “Furthermore,
O Commander of the Faithful, I have learnt that Al-Hayfa
owneth ten handmaidens whose peers are not to be found in thy
Palace, and they are mistresses of all manner instruments of mirth
and merriment and other matters; and amongst things said of
them by their lady when they marvelled at her good fortune,”
“Verily this day I have acquired half a score of slave-girls the like
of which Al-Maamun hath never collected.” But when the
Prince of True Believers heard this he gave ear to the tale anent
them during the livelong night till Allah caused the morn to
morrow. Then he sent for Ibrahim the Cup-companion, and to
him coming into the presence the Viceregent of Allah exclaimed,
“Mount without stay and delay taking with thee one thousand
Mamelukes and make thy way to this youth who is King of Al-Sind<a id="r277"></a><a href="#f277" class="c012"><sup>[277]</sup></a>
and named ’The Veiled Yusuf of Beauty,’ and bring me his
ten handmaidens. After which do thou ask concerning his case and
anent his subjects, whether he be just or unjust to the lieges, and
if he be righteous I will robe him in honourable robes and if
otherwise do thou bring him to my presence.” Hereupon Ibrahim
took leave of the Caliph and went forth at that very time and tide
intending for Al-Sind, and he ceased not wending till he arrived
there and found Yusuf setting out for the chase. But when the youth
saw the host approaching him——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_195">195</span>say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night, and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that, when Yusuf
beheld Ibrahim the Cup-companion, and those in his company, he
returned to the city and took them with him; yet he knew not
Ibrahim nor did Ibrahim know him. But on entering the capital
he was met by his guards and his soldiers who blessed him and
prayed for him length of days and permanence of rule wherefor
the courtier knew him to be a just King. Yusuf led them to and
lodged them in the House of Hospitality; after which returning
to his own Palace he sent for Ibrahim and assembled for him a
session and received him with the highmost honour that could be,
and rose to him and greeted him and embraced him and accompanied
him to the sitting-saloon where the twain took their places.
Then Yusuf bade summon the ten handmaidens with as many
instruments of music; and, sitting down begirt by them, he
ordered wine be brought. So they set before him flagons and
beakers of chrystal and jewelled cups; and presently pointing to
the first of the slave-girls whose name is not recorded, bade her
recite somewhat of her pleasantest poetry. So she hent the lute
in hand and set it upon her lap and swept it with a light touch
and caressed it with her finger-tips and smote it after eleven
<span class="pageno" id="Page_196">196</span>modes; then she returned to the first<a id="r278"></a><a href="#f278" class="c012"><sup>[278]</sup></a> and recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My heart for parting ever burns with lowe; ✿ My lids fiery with tear-floods ever flow:</div>
      <div class="line">Ho thou in lover’s loving ferly fair, ✿ Cut is the road for those Love gars to glow.</div>
      <div class="line">How many a youth has felt his vitals torn ✿ By slender forms and glances forceful prow?</div>
      <div class="line">Alas for lover slain by might of Love; ✿ Nor friend avails nor brother true, I trow!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the first handmaiden had finished, Yusuf rejoiced (as did
Ibrahim the Cup-companion) with excessive joy and the King
bade robe her in a sumptuous robe. Hereupon she drained her
cup and passed it to her compeer whose name was Takná, and
this second handmaiden taking beaker in hand placed it afore
her and hending the lute smote on it with many a mode; then,
returning to the first<a id="r279"></a><a href="#f279" class="c012"><sup>[279]</sup></a> while the wits of all were bewildered, she
improvised the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Look on the lute that ’minds of Mangonel; ✿ Whose strings are ropes that make each shot to tell:</div>
      <div class="line">And note the pipes that sound with shriek and cry, ✿ The pipes that cast a fearful joyful spell;</div>
      <div class="line">Espy the flagons ranged in serried rank ✿ And crops becrowned with wine that longs to well.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">But when Takná had finished her poetry Yusuf and Ibrahim were
gladdened and the King bade largesse her with a sumptuous robe
and a thousand dinars and she tossed off her cup and passed it to
her successor the third handmaiden Mubdi’<a id="r280"></a><a href="#f280" class="c012"><sup>[280]</sup></a> hight. She accepted
it and setting it before her took the lute and smote it after
manifold fashions and presently she spake these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_197">197</span>“Love with his painful pine doth rack this frame of me; ✿ Melts heart and maims my vitals cruel agony;</div>
      <div class="line">And rail my tears like cloud that rains the largest drops; ✿ And fails my hand to find what seek I fain to see:</div>
      <div class="line">Thee I conjure, O Yúsuf, by Him made thee King ✿ O Sahl-son, Oh our dearest prop, our dignity,</div>
      <div class="line">This man methinks hath come to part us lovers twain ✿ For in his eyes I see the flame of jealousy.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And when Mubdi’ had sung her song, Ibrahim the Cup-companion
and King Yusuf smiled and rejoiced and anon there befel them
what there befel and the two slipt down aswoon;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King
Yusuf and Ibrahim the Cup-companion hearing the song sung by
Mubdi’, the third handmaiden, both fell to the floor aswoon; and
when they revived after an hour or so, Ibrahim largessed to her
one thousand dinars and a robe purfled with glistening gold.
Then she drained her cup and crowning it again passed it to her
compeer whose name was Nasím<a id="r281"></a><a href="#f281" class="c012"><sup>[281]</sup></a> and who took it and set it in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_198">198</span>front of her. Then hending in hand the lute she played upon it
with manifold modes and lastly spake these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Blamer, blaming me for draining lonely wine, ✿ Stint carping, I this day to Holy War incline:</div>
      <div class="line">Oh fair reflection she within her wine-cup shows ✿ Her sight makes spirit dullest earthly flesh refine:</div>
      <div class="line">How mention her? By Allah ’tis forbid in writ ✿ To note the meaner charms in Eden-garth divine.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the fourth handmaiden had ended her verse, Ibrahim
gifted her with one thousand dinars and presented a sumptuous
robe to her owner, then she drank off her cup and passed it to
her compeer hight Al-Badr<a id="r282"></a><a href="#f282" class="c012"><sup>[282]</sup></a> and she sang the following lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“One robbed of heart amid song and wine ✿ And Love that smiteth with babe of eyne:</div>
      <div class="line">His voice to the lute shall make vitals pain ✿ And the wine shall heal all his pangs and pine:</div>
      <div class="line">Hast e’er seen the vile drawing near such draught ✿ Or miser close-fisted thereto incline?</div>
      <div class="line">The wine is set free in the two-handed jar<a id="r283"></a><a href="#f283" class="c012"><sup>[283]</sup></a> ✿ Like sun of summer in Aries’ sign.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she had finished Ibrahim bade reward her like the rest
with gold and gear and she passed her cup to her compeer whose
name was Radáh.<a id="r284"></a><a href="#f284" class="c012"><sup>[284]</sup></a> The sixth handmaiden drained it and performed
in four-and-twenty modes after which she sang these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O thou wine-comrade languor cease to show; ✿ Hand me the morning draught and ne’er foreslow;</div>
      <div class="line">And prize fair poesy and sweet musick hear ✿ And shun the ’say’ and naught of ’said’ beknow:</div>
      <div class="line">The wine of day-dawn drunk with joyous throng ✿ From house of Reason garreth Grief to go:</div>
      <div class="line"><span class="pageno" id="Page_199">199</span>The man of Kays aye loved his wine right well ✿ And from his lips made honey’d verse to flow;</div>
      <div class="line">And in like guise<a id="r285"></a><a href="#f285" class="c012"><sup>[285]</sup></a> came Isà singing sweet ✿ For such was custom of the long-ago.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Radah ended her verse and her improvising of mysterious
significance, and secret, King Yusuf and Ibrahim the Cup-companion
tore their robes from their bodies until naught remained
upon them save only the bag-breeches about their waists. Then
the twain shrieked aloud and at one moment and they fell fainting
to the floor, unheeding the world and their own selves from the
excess of that was in their heads of wine and hearing of poetry
spoken by the slave-girl. They remained in such condition for a
while of time, after which they recovered though still amazed,
a-drunken. Then they donned other dresses and sat down to
listen as before, when Radah drained her goblet and filled and
passed it to her compeer whose name was Na’ím;<a id="r286"></a><a href="#f286" class="c012"><sup>[286]</sup></a> and she taking
her lute, improvised the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“My poesy-gem showeth clear of shine, ✿ When appears that pearl with cheek coralline:</div>
      <div class="line">’Tis marvel the cloud cannot quench the blaze ✿ That fire in the heart and this water of eyne!</div>
      <div class="line">Then alas for Love who hath made me woe! ✿ Pine that rends and racks limbs and vitals o’ mine:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou Well of Poetry well forth thy gems ✿ O’er our drink when our cups overbrim with wine:</div>
      <div class="line">And sing in her presence, for Envy hath fled ✿ And flies jealous spite and all joys combine.</div>
      <div class="line">Oh the charms of wine which enthral the mind, ✿ Clear and clearing sprites by its sprite refined!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the seventh handmaiden had ended her verses, King Yusuf
and Ibrahim rejoiced with exceeding joy and each of them bade
gift her with a thousand gold pieces and quoth the courtier, “By
Allah Almighty, none of the Emirs or of the Wazirs or of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_200">200</span>Kings or of the Caliphs hath attained excellence like unto this
handmaid. Hereupon Na’im passed her goblet to her compeer
and she, whose name was Surúr,<a id="r287"></a><a href="#f287" class="c012"><sup>[287]</sup></a> tossed it off and taking in hand
her lute, sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“How is’t with heart of me all cares waylay ✿ As drowned in surging, tears of Deluge-day?</div>
      <div class="line">I weep for Time endured not to us twain ✿ As though Time’s honour did not oft betray.</div>
      <div class="line">O my lord Yúsuf, O my ending hope, ✿ By Him who made thee lone on Beauty’s way,</div>
      <div class="line">I dread lest glorious days us twain depart ✿ And youth’s bright world be dimmed to old and grey;</div>
      <div class="line">O Lord! be Parting’s palm for us undyed<a id="r288"></a><a href="#f288" class="c012"><sup>[288]</sup></a> ✿ Ere death, nor carry this my lord away.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the eighth handmaiden had ended her song, the twain
marvelled at her eloquence and were like to rend that was upon
them of raiment——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
goodwill! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_201">201</span>the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that King Yusuf and Ibrahim
the Cup-companion were like to rend that was upon them of
raiment and they joyed with extreme joy after hearing what
Surúr had sang to them. Hereupon she passed her cup to her
fellow, hight Zahrat al-Hayy,<a id="r289"></a><a href="#f289" class="c012"><sup>[289]</sup></a> who took it and recited as follows:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O cup-boy, I crave thee cup-comrade to be ✿ And hearten my heart of its malady;</div>
      <div class="line">Nor pass me the bowls for I sorely dread ✿ When drunken all dolours of Love-lowe to dree,</div>
      <div class="line">To be vilely reviled in the sittings of men, ✿ To be frowardly treated where zephyrs play free.</div>

      <div class="line">By Allah, show ruth, be compassionate, ✿ For Allah deals pardon compassionately.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Yusuf and Ibrahim, hearing her words, were gladdened with
excessive gladness and cried to the ninth handmaid, “May the
lord be copious to thee like the fruitful years!” Then the Cup-companion
bade gift her with one thousand gold pieces as likewise
did her lord. Hereupon she passed her cup to the tenth
handmaiden known as Muhjat al-Kulúb<a id="r291"></a><a href="#f291" class="c012"><sup>[291]</sup></a> who fell to improvising
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O Blamer, who canst not my case explain; ✿ Cease, for who blame friends shall of blame complain;</div>

      <div class="line">Deign the God of ’Arsh make thy days endure ✿ In wealth and honour sans pause or wane;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When Muhjat al-Kulub ended her song, Yusuf gifted her with a
splendid robe and a thousand gold pieces as eke did Ibrahim, and
presently the courtier said to the handmaiden, “Who is Ibrahim
that thou shouldst sing of him in song?” She replied, “Walláhi,
O my lord, he is son of Ishak, amongst the pleasant ones sans peer
and a cup-companion to the Caliphs dear and the pearl concealed
and the boon friend of our lord the Commander of the Faithful
Al-Maamún and his familiar who to him joy and enjoyment
maketh known. Ah! happy the man who can look upon him
and forgather with him and company with him before his death;
and verily by Allah he is the master of the Age and the one Wonder
of the World. Moreover, by the Almighty, O my lord, wert thou
to see this lute fall into his hands, thou wouldst hear it converse in
every language with the tongues of birds and beasts and of the
sons of Adam: and well nigh would the place dance ere he had
improvised a word. And he the horizons can make to joy and
lover with overlove can destroy, nor shall any after his decease
such excellence of speech employ.” All this, and Muhjat al-Kulub
knew not who was sitting beside them as she went on to praise
Ibrahim. Hereupon he took the lute from her hand and smote it
till thou hadst deemed that within the instrument lurked babes of
the Jinns<a id="r293"></a><a href="#f293" class="c012"><sup>[293]</sup></a> which were crying and wailing while spake the strings,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_203">203</span>and in fine King Yusuf imagined that the palace had upflown
with them between heaven and earth. And the handmaidens sang
to his tunes in sore astonishment; when Ibrahim designed to talk
but King Yusuf cut him short and fell to saying poetry in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“By the rights of our lord who shows ruth in extreme, ✿ And Giver and Guide and boon Prophet we deem,</div>
      <div class="line">And by Ka’abah resplendent and all its site ✿ And by Zemzem, Safá and the wall Hatím,</div>
      <div class="line">Lo! thou ’rt hight Ibrahim, and suppose I say ✿ Thee sooth, my wits thou must surely esteem:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now Ibrahim kept his secret and did not manifest himself to
any, but presently he also improvised and spake in these words
preserving the measure and rhyme:—</p>

<p class="c000">And when Ibrahim had finished his verses, Yusuf said to him,
“By the virtue of Almighty Allah, an I guess aright and my shot<a id="r297"></a><a href="#f297" class="c012"><sup>[297]</sup></a>
go not amiss, thou art Ibrahim the musician;” but the courtier
retained his incognito and replied, “O my lord, Ibrahim is my
familiar friend and I am a man of Al-Basrah who hath stolen
<span class="pageno" id="Page_204">204</span>from him sundry of his modes and airs for the lute and other
instruments and I have the practice of improvisation.” Now when
Ibrahim was speaking behold, there came one of the Caliph’s
pages and he walked up to the head of the assembly bearing with
him a letter, which he handed to his lord. But Yusuf put forth
his hand and took it, and after reading the superscription he learnt
that his companion was Ibrahim without doubt or mistake, so he
said to him, “By Allah, O my lord, verily thou hast slighted me,
for that thou hast not informed me of thyself.” Quoth the other,
“By Allah, I feared from thee lest I give thee excess of trouble;”
and quoth Yusuf, “Do thou take to thee all these handmaids
whom the Commander of the Faithful hath bid thee receive.”
Ibrahim replied, “Nay, I will not accept from thee the handmaidens
but rather will I fend from thee the Prince of True
Believers;” however, King Yusuf rejoined, “I have gifted them
to the Viceregent of Allah: an thou take them not I will send
them by other than thyself.” Presently King Yusuf set apart for
the Caliph great store of gifts, and when the handmaidens heard
of that they wept with sore weeping. Ibrahim, hearing their
wailing, found it hard to bear, and he also shed tears for the
sobbing and crying of them; and presently he exclaimed, “Allah
upon thee, O Yusuf, leave these ten handmaidens by thee and I
will be thy ward with the Prince of True Believers.” But Yusuf
answered, “Now by the might of Him who stablished the mountains
stable, unless thou bear them away with thee I will despatch
them escorted by another.” Hereupon Ibrahim took them and
farewelled King Yusuf and fared forth and hastened his faring
till the party arrived at Baghdad, the House of Peace, where he
went up into the Palace of the Commander of the Faithful——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is

night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Ibrahim
reached Baghdad and went up to the Palace of the Commander of
the Faithful and stood in the presence he was asked, “What hast
thou brought for us from thy journey, O Ibrahim?” whereto he
answered, “O our lord, I have come to thee with all thou willest
and wishest that of rede be right and of word apposite.” Quoth he,
“And what may that be?” and quoth the other, “The ten
handmaids:” and so saying he set them before the Caliph,
whereupon they kissed ground and did him suit and service and
deprecated for him and greeted him with blessings, and each and
every of them addressed him in tongue most eloquent and with
theme most prevalent. The Prince of True Believers hugely
admired them, marvelling at their deftness of address and their
sweetness of speech which he had never witnessed in any other;
and he was delighted with their beauty and loveliness and their
stature and symmetrical grace, and he wondered with extreme
wonderment how their lord had consented they should be brought
before him. Then cried he, “O Ibrahim, what hath been thy
case with the owner of these damsels, and did he commit them to
thee despite himself in anger and care or with resignation of mind
and broadening of bosom and joy and satisfaction?” “O my
lord,” said Ibrahim, “verily he made them over to me in none
<span class="pageno" id="Page_206">206</span>except the best of dispositions, and Allah give him length of life
for a youth! How benign was his countenance and how beautiful,
and how perfect and how liberal were his hands and prompt to
act, and how excellent were his wits and how goodly and gracious
was his society and how yielding was his nature and how great
was his dignity and how just were his dealings with his lieges!
By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, when I went to him
from thee I found him outside his city intending for the hunt and
chase and about to enjoy himself in pleasurable case, but seeing
our coming he met me and salam’d to me and greeted me and
rejoiced in me with extreme joy. All this, and he knew me not
nor did I on my part know him; but he took me with him and
returned to town, and as we entered he was met by the Lords of
the land and the lieges who prayed for him; so I knew that man
to be their King and Captain of commandment, also that he was
equitable to his subjects. Then he made me alight in his House
of Hospitality, and went up into his Palace, after which he sent
to call me and I obeyed his summons, when he set apart for me
an apartment under his own roof and taking me by the hand led
me thereto, where I found everything the best that could be.
Anon he despatched for us wine and wax candles and perfumes
and fruits fresh and dry and whatnot of that which becometh such
assembly; and, when this was done, he bade summon the ten
handmaidens, and they also took their seats in the session, and
they smote their instruments and they sang verse wherein each
one excelled her companion. But one of them insisted in her
song upon the name of me, saying:—None availeth to compose
such lines save Ibrahim the Cup-companion, the son of Ishak. Now
I had denied myself to their lord and acquainted him not with my
name; but when the damsel had finished her verse, I largessed to
her a thousand gold pieces and asked her, Who may be this
Ibrahim whereat thou hast hinted in thy song? Said she, He is
the boon-companion of the Caliph and he is unique among the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_207">207</span>pleasant; then she fell to praising me with praise galore than
which naught could be more, unknowing me the while, until I
took the lute from her hand and smote it with a touch unlike
their play. Hereby their lord discovered me and said in his
verse:—Thou art Ibrahim without doubt or mistake; but still I
denied myself replying, I am a man from Al-Basrah and a familiar
of Ibrahim the Master-Musician: And on this wise I answered
him, when behold, there came up to us a page bearing a rescript
from thee. So King Yusuf took it from his hand and read the
address when he made certain that I was Ibrahim, the Cup-companion,
and having learnt my name he blamed me saying:—O
Ibrahim, thou hast denied thyself to me. O my lord, I replied,
’Twas that I feared for thee excess of trouble; after which quoth
he, Verily these ten damsels are a free gift from me to the
Commander of the Faithful. Hearing these words I refused to
receive them and promised on my return to the Caliph that I
would defend their lord from all detraction, but he cried, O
Ibrahim, unless thou take them I will forward them with other
than thyself. And lastly, O Prince of True Believers, he presented
to me fifty slave-girls and as many Mamelukes and an
hundred and fifty negro-serviles and twenty steeds of purest blood,
with their housings and furniture, and four hundred she-camels
and twenty pods of musk.<a id="r298"></a><a href="#f298" class="c012"><sup>[298]</sup></a>” Then having told his tale, the
Cup-companion fell to commending Yusuf, and the Caliph
inclined ear to him admiring at this man and his generosity
and his openness of hand and the eloquence of his tongue and
the excellence of his manners, until Al-Maamun desired to forgather
with him and work him weal and gift him with liberal
gifts. Presently the Caliph bade summon the ten handmaidens
and the hour was past supper-tide, at which time Ibrahim the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_208">208</span>Cup-companion, was seated beside him without other being
present. And as soon as the girls came before him the Caliph
bade them take their seats, and when they obeyed his order the
wine cups went merrily round, and the ten were directed to let
him hear somewhat of their chaunting and playing. So they fell to
smiting their instruments of mirth and merriment and singing
their songs, one after other, and each as she ended her poetry
touched the Caliph with delight until it came to the last of
them, who was hight Muhjat al-Kulúb;——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the last
poetical piece recited by the ten damsels to the Commander of
the Faithful was by Muhjat al-Kulub; and he upon hearing it
rose at once to his feet and shrieked and fell aswoon for an hour
of time. And when he recovered he cried, “By Allah, O Muhjat
al-Kulub and Oh of eyne the coolth, do thou repeat to me what
thou hast said.” Hereupon she touched her instrument with
another touch accompanying the repetition of her poetry in a
style wholly unlike the first, and she repeated her song in the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_209">209</span>mode and form Nahawand.<a id="r299"></a><a href="#f299" class="c012"><sup>[299]</sup></a> But when the Caliph heard her, his
wits were wildered, and he rent that was upon him of raiment,
and he fell fainting to the floor until Ibrahim the Cup-companion
and the ten handmaidens deemed him dead. But as he revived
after an hour of time he said to the handmaiden, “O Muhjat al-Kulub,
ask and it shall be granted to thee.” “I pray,” quoth
she, “first of Allah and then of the Commander of the Faithful
that he restore us, all the ten, unto our lord;” and he granted
her request after he had gifted them all and largessed them.<a id="r300"></a><a href="#f300" class="c012"><sup>[300]</sup></a> He
also wrote to their owner, King Yusuf, a royal Rescript appointing
him Sultan over all the kingdoms that were in and about the
land of Al-Sind; and moreover that whenas the Caliph might
be absent from his good city of Baghdad, Yusuf should take his
place in bidding and forbidding and ordering and governing.
This ended, he despatched the ten slave-girls with a body of his
Chamberlains after giving them wealth galore and of presents and
rarities great store; and they fared forth from him and ceased not
faring till they reached the city of Al-Sind. Now when the ten
handmaidens drew nigh thereto they sent to inform King Yusuf of
their coming, and he commissioned his Wazir Mohammed bin Ibrahim
to meet and receive them, and he caused them enter the Palace,
wondering the while that his ten bondswomen had not found favour
with the Prince of True Believers. So he summoned them to
his presence and asked them thereanent, and they answered by
relating all that had befallen them; and presently Muhjat al-Kulub
presented to him the royal Rescript, and when he read it he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_210">210</span>increased in joy and delight.<a id="r301"></a><a href="#f301" class="c012"><sup>[301]</sup></a> Now<a id="r302"></a><a href="#f302" class="c012"><sup>[302]</sup></a> when supper was over the

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_213">213</span>Whilome there was a King in the land of Al-Sín and he had
three male children to whose mother befel a mysterious malady.
So they summoned for her Sages and leaches of whom none could
understand her ailment and she abode for a while of time strown
upon her couch. At last came a learned physician to whom they
described her disorder and he declared, “Indeed this sickness
cannot be healed save and except by the Water of Life, a treasure
that can be trove only in the land Al-’Irák.” When her sons
heard these words they said to their sire, “There is no help but
that we make our best endeavour and fare thither and thence
bring for our mother the water in question.” Hereupon the King
gat ready for them a sufficiency of provaunt for the way and they
farewelled him and set forth intending for Barbarian-land.<a id="r304"></a><a href="#f304" class="c012"><sup>[304]</sup></a> The
three Princes ceased not travelling together for seven days, at the
end of which time one said to other, “Let us separate and let each
make search in a different stead, so haply shall we hit upon our
need.” So speaking they parted after dividing their viaticum and,
bidding adieu to one another, each went his own way. Now the
eldest Prince ceased not wending over the wastes and none directed
him to a town save after a while when his victual was exhausted
and he had naught remaining to eat. At that time he drew near
to one of the cities where he was met at the entrance by a Jewish
man who asked him saying, “Wilt thou serve, O Moslem?”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_214">214</span>Quoth the youth to himself, “I will take service and haply Allah
shall discover to me my need.” Then said he aloud, “I will
engage myself to thee;” and said the Jew, “Every day thou shalt
serve me in yonder Synagogue, whose floor thou shalt sweep and
clean its mattings and rugs and thou shalt scour the candlesticks.”
“’Tis well,” replied the Prince, after which he fell to serving in the
Jew’s house, until one day of the days when his employer said to
him, “O Youth, I will bargain with thee a bargain.” “And what
may that be?” asked the young Prince, and the man answered, “I
will condition with thee for thy daily food a scone and a half but
the broken loaf thou shalt not devour nor shalt thou break the
whole bread; yet do thou eat thy sufficiency and whoso doth
contrary to our agreement we will flay<a id="r305"></a><a href="#f305" class="c012"><sup>[305]</sup></a> his face. So, an it be
thy desire to serve, thou art welcome.” Now of his inexperience
the Prince said to him, “We will serve thee;” whereupon his
employer rationed him with a scone and a half and went forth
leaving him in the Synagogue. When it was noon the youth
waxed anhungered so he ate the loaf and a half; and about mid-afternoon
the Jew came to him and finding that he had devoured
the bread asked him thereanent and the other answered, “I was
hungry and I ate up all.” Cried the Jew, “I made compact with
thee from the beginning that thou shouldst eat neither the whole
nor the broken,” and so saying he fared forth from him and
presently brought a party of Jews, who in that town numbered
some fifty head, and they seized the youth and slew him and
bundling up the body in a mat<a id="r306"></a><a href="#f306" class="c012"><sup>[306]</sup></a> set it in a corner of the Synagogue.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_215">215</span>Such was his case; but as regards the Cadet Prince, he
ceased not wayfaring and wending from town to town until Fate
at last threw him into the same place where his brother had been
slain and perchance as he entered it he found the same Jew
standing at the Synagogue-door. The man asked him, “Wilt
thou serve, O Moslem?” and as the youth answered “Yea verily,”
he led the new comer to his quarters. After this the Jew had
patience for the first day and the second day——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying

other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——“With love and
good will!” It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King’s son tarried
with the Jewish man the first day and the second day, after which
his employer did with him even as he had done by his brother
before him; to wit, he slew him and wrapping him in a mat placed
his corpse beside that of the eldest Prince. On this wise it happed
to these twain; but as regards the youngest of the three, he ceased
<span class="pageno" id="Page_216">216</span>not travelling from town to town and enduring excessive fatigue
and hunger and nakedness until by decree of Destiny and by
determination of the Predestinator he was thrown into the hands
of the same Jew whom he found standing at the Synagogue-door.
Here the man accosted him, saying, “Wilt thou serve, O Moslem?”
and the Youth agreeing he imposed upon him the same pact which
he had made with his two brothers, and the Prince said “’Tis well,
O Master.” Then quoth the Jew, “Do thou sweep the Synagogue
and cleanse it and shake out the mats and rugs;” and quoth the
other, “Good!” But when the Prince left him and went into the
building, his glance fell upon the two bundles of matting wherein
were wrapped the corpses of his brothers, so he drew near to them
and, raising a corner of the covering, found the bodies stinking
and rotten. Hereat he arose and fared forth the Synagogue and
opening a pit in the ground took up his brothers (and he
sorrowing over them and weeping) and buried them. Then he
returned to the building and, rolling up the mats, heaped them
together and so with the rugs, after which he built a fire under
them until the whole were burnt and after he took down the
candlesticks one and all and brake them to bits. Now when it
was mid-afternoon behold, the Jew came to the Synagogue and
found a bonfire and all the furniture thereof lying in ashes and
when he saw this he buffeted his face and cried, “Wherefore, O
Moslem, hast thou done on such wise?” Replied the youth,
“Thou hast defrauded me, O Master,” and rejoined the Jew, “I
have not cheated thee of aught. However, O Moslem, hie thee
home and bid thy mistress slaughter a meat-offering and cook it
and do thou bring it hither forthright.” “’Tis well, O my
Master,” said the Prince. Now the Jew had two boy children in
whom he delighted and the youth going to his house knocked at
the door which was opened to him by the Jewess and she asked,
“What needest thou?” Quoth the Prince to the Jew’s wife, “O
my mistress, my master hath sent me to thee saying:—Do thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_217">217</span>slaughter the two lambs that are with thee and fifty chickens and
an hundred pair<a id="r307"></a><a href="#f307" class="c012"><sup>[307]</sup></a> of pigeons, for all the masters are with him in
the Synagogue and ’tis his desire to circumcise the boys.”<a id="r308"></a><a href="#f308" class="c012"><sup>[308]</sup></a> The
Jew’s wife replied to him, “And who shall slaughter me all this?”
when he rejoined, “I will.” So she brought out to him the lambs
and the chickens and the pigeons and he cut the throats of all.
The Jewess hereupon arose and cried upon her neighbours to aid
her in the cooking until the meats were well done and all were
dished up. Then the youth hending the ten porcelain plates in
hand went with them to a house in the Ghetto<a id="r309"></a><a href="#f309" class="c012"><sup>[309]</sup></a> and rapped at the
door and said, “My Master hath sent all these to you.” Meanwhile
the Jew was in the Synagogue unknowing of such doings;
and as the Prince was setting down the last of the plates which
he carried with him, behold! the Jew came to that house because
he had noticed his servant’s absence, so he repaired thither to see
concerning the business of the meat offering wherewith he had
charged him. He found his home in a state of pother and
up-take and down-set and he asked the folk, “What is the
matter?” They related the whole to him and said, “Thou
sentest to demand such-and-such,” and when he heard this case he
beat his face with his brogue<a id="r310"></a><a href="#f310" class="c012"><sup>[310]</sup></a>——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that, when the
Jew came to his home and looked around, he found it in the
condition which the youth had contrived, so he beat his face with
his brogue and cried, “O the ruin of my house!” Suddenly
the Prince entered and his employer asked him, “Wherefore
doest thou on such wise, O Moslem?” Answered the youth,
“Verily thou hast defrauded me,” and rejoined the other, “No;
I have not cheated thee on any wise.” Then said the Jew in his
mind:—“Needs must I set a snare for this youth and slay him;”
so he went in to his wife and said, “Spread for us our beds upon
the terrace-roof; and we will take thereto the young Moslem,
our servant, and cause him lie upon the edge, and when he is
drowned in slumber we will push him between us and roll him
along the floor till he fall down from the terrace and break
to bits his neck.” Now by fiat of Fate the youth was standing
and overhearing<a id="r311"></a><a href="#f311" class="c012"><sup>[311]</sup></a> their words. As soon as it was night-time
the woman arose and spread the beds upon the roof according
as her husband had charged her do; but about mid-afternoon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_219">219</span>the Prince bought him half a pound of filberts and placed them
with all care and circumspection in his breast-pocket. Presently
the Jew said to him, “O Moslem, we design to sleep in the
open air, for the weather is now summery;” and said he, “’Tis
well, O my Master.” Hereupon the Jew and the Jewess and the
children and the Prince their servant went up to the roof and
the first who lay him down was the house-master, placing his
wife and children beside him. Then said he to the youth, “Do
thou sleep here upon the side,”<a id="r312"></a><a href="#f312" class="c012"><sup>[312]</sup></a> when the Prince brought the
filberts out of his breast-pocket and cracked them with his teeth,
and as often as they repeated to him, “Arise, O Moslem, and take
thy place on the couch,” he answered them, “Whenas I shall
have eaten these filberts.” He ceased not watching them till
all had lain down and were fast asleep, when he took his place
on the bed between the mother and the two boys. Presently the
Jew awoke, and thinking that the youth was sleeping on the
edge, he pushed his wife, and his wife pushed the servant, and
the servant pushed the children towards the terrace-marge, and
both the little ones fell over and their brain-pans<a id="r313"></a><a href="#f313" class="c012"><sup>[313]</sup></a> were broken
and they died. The Jew hearing the noise of the fall fancied
that none had tumbled save his servant the young Moslem;
so he rose in joy and awoke his wife saying, “Indeed the youth
hath rolled off the terrace-roof and hath been killed.” Hereat
the woman sat up, and not finding her boys beside her, whilst
the Prince still lay there she wailed and shrieked and buffeted her
cheeks, and cried to her husband, “Verily none hath fallen save
the children.” Hereat he jumped up and attempted to cast the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_220">220</span>youth from the roof; but he, swiftlier than the lightning, sprang
to his feet and shouted at the Jew and filled him with fear, after
which he stabbed him with a knife which was handy, and the
other fell down killed and drowned in the blood he had spilled.
Now the Jew’s wife was a model of beauty and of loveliness and
stature and perfect grace, and when the King’s son turned upon
her and designed to slay her, she fell at his feet, and kissing them,
placed herself under his protection. Hereupon the youth left her
alive, saying to himself, “This be a woman and indeed she must not
be mishandled;”<a id="r314"></a><a href="#f314" class="c012"><sup>[314]</sup></a> and the Jewess asked him, “O my lord, what is
the cause of thy doing on this wise? At first thou camest to me
and toldest me the untruth, such-and-such falsehoods, and secondly,
thou wroughtest for the slaughter of my husband and children.”
Answered he, “In truth thy man slew my two brothers wrongously
and causelessly!” Now when the Jewess heard of this deed
she enquired of him, “And art thou their very brother?” and he
replied, “In good sooth they were my brethren;” after which
he related to her the reason of their faring from their father to
seek the Water of Life for their mother’s use. Hereat she cried,
“By Allah, O my lord, the wrong was with my mate and not
with thee; but the Decreed chevisance doth need, nor is there
flight from it indeed; so do thou abide content. However, as
regards the Water in question, it is here ready beside me, and
if thou wilt carry me along with thee to thy country I will give
thee that same, which otherwise I will withhold from thee; and
haply my wending with thee may bring thee to fair end.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_221">221</span>Quoth the Prince in his mind, “Take her with thee and peradventure
she shall guide thee to somewhat of good:” and thereupon
promised to bear her away. So she arose and led him into
a closet where she showed him all the hoards of the Jew, ready
moneys and jewellery and furniture and raiment; and everything
that was with her of riches and resources she committed to the
young Prince, amongst these being the Water of Life. So they
bore away the whole of that treasure and he also carried off the
Jewess, who was beautiful exceedingly, none being her peer in
that day. Then they crossed the wilds and the wastes, intending
for the land of Al-Sín, and they persevered for a while of time.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the young
Prince ceased not wayfaring until the twain drew near to the
capital of China<a id="r315"></a><a href="#f315" class="c012"><sup>[315]</sup></a> where, by the fiat of Fate and the sealed decree
of Destiny, on entering the walls he found that his father had
fared to the mercy of Allah Almighty, and that the city, being
Kingless, had become like unto a flock of sheep lacking shepherd.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_222">222</span>Moreover he was certified that the Lords of his father’s land and
the Grandees of the realm and all the lieges were in the uttermost
confusion. He went up to the palace and forgathered with his
mother, and seeing that she had not been healed of her sickness, he
brought her out the Water of Life and gave her to drink some
little thereof whereby health returned to her and she rose from her
couch and took seat and salam’d to him and asked concerning his
brethren. However he concealed his secret thereanent fearing
lest it induce in her weakly state a fresh attack and discovered to
her naught but said, “Verily, we parted at such a place in order
to seek the Water of Life.” Then she looked upon his companion
the Jewess (and she cast in the mould of loveliness) and she
questioned him concerning the woman and he recounted to her
the whole affair, first and last, still concealing for the reason
aforesaid, the fate of his brothers. Now on the second day the
bruit went abroad throughout the city that the King’s son had
returned; so the Wazirs and Emirs and the Lords of the land and
all who had their share in governance forgathered with him and
they set him as King and Sultan in the stead of his sire. He took
seat on the throne of his Kingship and bade and forebade and
raised and deposed and so tarried for a while of time, until one day
of the days when he determined to enjoy the hunt and chase and
divert himself in pleasurable case.<a id="r316"></a><a href="#f316" class="c012"><sup>[316]</sup></a> So he and his host rode
forth the city when his glance fell upon a Badawi girl who was
standing with the Shaykh her father considering his retinue; and
the age of the maiden might have mastered thirteen years. But
as soon as the King looked upon the girl love of her upon his
heart alighted, and he was thereby engrossed, for she was perfect
in beauty and comeliness. Hereupon he returned to his palace
and sending for her father asked her of him in marriage; the
Shaykh, however, answered saying, “O our lord the Sultan, I will
<span class="pageno" id="Page_223">223</span>not give up my daughter save to one who hath a handicraft of his
own,<a id="r317"></a><a href="#f317" class="c012"><sup>[317]</sup></a> for verily trade is a defence against poverty and folk say:—Handicraft
an it enrich not still it veileth.”<a id="r318"></a><a href="#f318" class="c012"><sup>[318]</sup></a> Hereupon the King
took thought in himself and said to the Shaykh, “O Man, I am
Sovran and Sultan and with me is abundant good;” but the other
replied, “O King of the Age, in King-craft there is no trust.”
However, of his exceeding love to the girl the Sultan presently
summoned the Shaykh of the Mat-makers and learnt from him
the craft of plaiting and he wove these articles of various colours
both plain and striped.<a id="r319"></a><a href="#f319" class="c012"><sup>[319]</sup></a> After this he sent for the father of the
damsel and recounted to him what he had done and the Shaykh
said to him “O King of the Age, my daughter is in poor case and
you are King and haply from some matter may befal a serious
matter; moreover the lieges may say:—Our King hath wived
with a Badawi girl.” “O Shaykh,” replied the King, “all men
are the sons of Adam and Eve.” Hereupon the Badawi granted
to him his daughter and got ready her requisites in the shortest
possible time and when the marriage-tie was tied the King went in
unto her and found her like unto a pearl.<a id="r320"></a><a href="#f320" class="c012"><sup>[320]</sup></a> So he rejoiced in her and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_224">224</span>felt his heart at rest and after tarrying with her a full-told year,
one chance day of the days he determined to go forth in disguise
and to wander about town and solace himself with its spectacles
alone and unattended. So he went into the vestiary where the
garments were kept and doffing his dress donned a garb which converted
him into a Darwaysh. After this he fared forth in early
morning to stroll around the streets and enjoy the sights of the
highways and markets, yet he knew not what was hidden from him
in the World of the Future. Now when it was noon-tide he entered
a street which set off from the Bazar and yet was no thoroughfare,<a id="r321"></a><a href="#f321" class="c012"><sup>[321]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_225">225</span>and this he followed up until he reached the head and end, where
stood a cook<a id="r322"></a><a href="#f322" class="c012"><sup>[322]</sup></a> making Kabábs. So he said to himself, “Enter yon
shop and dine therein.” He did so and was met by sundry shopmen
who seeing him in Darwaysh’s garb welcomed him and
greeted him and led him within, when he said to them, “I want a
dinner.” “Upon the head and the eyes be it,” they replied and
conducting him into a room within the shop showed him another
till he came to the place intended when they said to him, “Enter
herein, O my lord.” So he pushed open the door and finding in
the closet a matting and a prayer-rug<a id="r323"></a><a href="#f323" class="c012"><sup>[323]</sup></a> spread thereupon he said to
himself, “By Allah, this is indeed a secret spot, well concealed
from the eyes of folk.” Then he went up to the prayer-rug and
would have sat down upon it after pulling off his papooshes, but
hardly had he settled himself in his seat when he fell through the
floor for a depth of ten fathoms. And while falling he cried out,
“Save me, O God the Saviour;” for now he knew that the people
of that place only pretended to make Kababs and they had digged
a pit within their premises. Also he was certified that each and
every who came in asking for dinner were led to that place where
they found the prayer-rug bespread and supposed that it was set
therein for the use of the diners. But when the Sultan fell from
his seat into the souterrain, he was followed by the thieves who
designed to murther him and to carry off his clothes, even as they
had done to many others.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the King
fell into the pit (and he disguised in Darwaysh-garb) the thieves
sought to slay him and carry off his clothes, when quoth he to
them, “Wherefore kill me when my garments are not worth a
thousand groats<a id="r324"></a><a href="#f324" class="c012"><sup>[324]</sup></a> and I own not a single one? However, I have
at hand a handicraft whereat I am ready to work sitting in this
pit and do you take and sell my produce for a thousand faddahs;
and every day I will labour for you, finishing one and requiring
naught save my meat and drink and perpetual privacy in your
quarters.” “At what craft art thou crafty?” asked they, and he
answered, “At mat-weaving: so do ye bring me a piastre<a id="r325"></a><a href="#f325" class="c012"><sup>[325]</sup></a> worth
of rushes<a id="r326"></a><a href="#f326" class="c012"><sup>[326]</sup></a> and the same of yarn.” Accordingly they fared forth
and fetched him his need and presently he made a mat and said to
them, “Take ye this and sell it not for less than a thousand
faddahs.” They hied out and carried the work to the Bazar where,
as soon as the folk caught sight thereof, they crowded about the
seller, each man offering more until the price had risen to a thousand
and two hundred silvern nusfs. Hereupon said the thieves to
themselves, “By Allah, this Darwaysh can profit us with much
profit and enrich us without other trade;” so every morning for
ten days they brought him rushes and yarn and he wove for them
a mat which they vended for a like sum. On this wise it happened
<span class="pageno" id="Page_227">227</span>to him; but as regards the Wazirs and Emirs and lords of the
land, they went up to the Council-chamber<a id="r327"></a><a href="#f327" class="c012"><sup>[327]</sup></a> for the first day and
the second and the third until the week was ended and they
awaited the coming of their King, but he came not, neither found
they any tidings nor hit they upon any manifest traces and none
knew whither he had wended. So they were sore exercised and
confusion befel with much tittle-tattle of folk; each one said his
own say nor were they guided by any to what they should do.
Furthermore, as often as they asked of the Harem they were
answered, “We have no tidings of him;” so they were perplext
and at last they agreed, their King being clean lost, to set up a
Sultan as his successor. However the Wazirs said, “Tarry ye until
Allah shall open unto us a door whereby we shall be rightly
directed to him.” Now the King had required from the people of
the pit rushes of various colours, red and green, and when they
fetched them he fell to weaving a mat like those of the striped
sort, whereon he figured by marks and signs the name of the quarter
wherein he was gaoled<a id="r328"></a><a href="#f328" class="c012"><sup>[328]</sup></a> and discovered to his men the way thereto
and the site itself; after which he said to the thieves, “Verily this
mat misfitteth every save those in the Royal Palace and its price
is seven thousand faddahs. Do you take it and hie with it to the
Sultan who shall buy it of you and pay you the price.” They
obeyed his bidding and wending to the palace of the Grand Wazir
found him sitting with the Lords of the land and with the Nobles
of the realm talking over the matter of the King when behold,
those who brought the mat entered into his presence. Quoth the
Minister, “What be that which is with you?” and quoth they, “A
mat!” whereupon he bade them unroll it and they did so before
him; and he, being sagacious, experienced in all affairs, looked
<span class="pageno" id="Page_228">228</span>thereat and fell to examining the bundle and turning it about, and
considering it until suddenly he espied the signs thereupon figured.
He at once understood what they meant and he was rightly
directed to the place where the King was confined; so he arose
without delay and after ordering them to seize those who had
brought the mat took with him a party and went forth, he and
they, after mastering the marks which were upon the weft. He
ceased not wending (and the people of the pit with him under
arrest) until such time as he arrived at the place. Here they went
in and opened the souterrain and brought out the King who was
still in Darwaysh garb. Presently the Wazir sent for the Linkman
and when he appeared they seized all who were in that place and
struck off their heads; but as for the women they put them into
large sacks<a id="r329"></a><a href="#f329" class="c012"><sup>[329]</sup></a> of camel’s hair and drowned them in the river: furthermore,
they spoiled all that was on that site and the Sultan gave
orders to raze the house until it became level with the ground.
When all this had been done they questioned the Sultan concerning
the cause of that event and he informed them of what had befallen
him from incept to conclusion and lastly he cried, “Walláhi! the
cause of my escape from this danger was naught save the handicraft
which I learnt; to wit, the making of mats, and the Almighty
requite with welfare him who taught me because he was the means
of my release; and, but for my learning this trade, ye had never
known the way to discover me, seeing that Allah maketh for every
effect a cause.” And having on such wise ended this tale Ibn
Ahyam<a id="r330"></a><a href="#f330" class="c012"><sup>[330]</sup></a> fell to relating to the King the history of</p>

</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_231">231</span>It is related that there was a King among the manifold Kings
of Al-Hind, and he had a Wazir which was a right good
counsellor to the realm and pitiful to the lieges and the Fakirs
and merciful to the miserable and just in all his dealings.
Despite this the Grandees of the kingdom hated him and envied
him, and at all times and seasons when he went forth the presence
or returned to his house, one of the Emirs would come forward
and say to the King, “O our lord, verily the Wazir doth of doings
thus and thus,”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating,
that the Lords of the land, whenever the Wazir was absent
<span class="pageno" id="Page_232">232</span>traduced him and maligned him in the presence of the Sultan,
saying, “The Minister doth such and such doings,” and this
continued for a while of time. Now one day of the days, as the
Sultan was sitting in his palace behold, a running messenger
came to him bearing letters from sundry of the provinces which
were in his reign imploring help against their foemen’s violence.
“What may be done in this case?” asked the Sultan, and his
Nobles answered saying, “Send to them the Wazir,” but they
spake not this speech save in their resolve to ruin him and
their determination to destroy him. Hereupon the King sent
for him and summoned him and commanded him to journey
to the places in question; but those of whom the complaints
had been made threw dangers and difficulties in his way. Said
the Wazir, “Hearing and obeying;” and after preparing himself
for wayfare he set forth on his way. Now the Lords had
despatched letters to the province whither he intended, apprising
the folk of his coming, and saying to them, “Empower him not
with anything, and if you avail to work him aught of wrong,
so do.” When the Wazir marched upon those places he was
met by the people with welcomes and deputations to receive him
and offer him presents and rarities and sumptuous gifts, and all
who were therein honoured him with highmost honour. Presently
he sent for their adversaries, and having brought them before him
made peace between the two parties, and their gladness increased
and their sadness ceased, and he tarried with them for a month
full-told; after which he set out on his homeward march. The
Lords, however, had reported all this to the King and they were
right sore and sorrowful, for that their desire had been the
destruction of the Minister. And one day of the days as the
Wazir was sitting at home, behold, a party of Chamberlains
appeared before him and summoned him to the presence, saying,
“Arise, the King requireth thee.” He rose without stay or
delay, and taking horse made for the presence, and ceased not
<span class="pageno" id="Page_233">233</span>riding until he had reached the palace and had gone into the King,
who forthright bade throw him into gaol. (Now it happened
that the prison had seven doors.)<a id="r332"></a><a href="#f332" class="c012"><sup>[332]</sup></a> Cried the Wazir, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great; and verily we be Allah’s and unto Him are we returning!
Would I wot why and wherefore the King hath confined me and
for what cause; but Omnipotence is Allah’s.” As soon as the
Minister was quartered in his new quarters the Sovran sent
to interdict his eating any food of flesh-kind, allowing only
bread and cheese and olives and oil, and so left him in durance
vile. Hereupon all the folk applied them to addressing the King
with petitions and to interceding for the captive; but this was not
possible; nay, the Sultan’s wrath waxed hotter nor did it soon cool,
for the Wazir abode in gaol during the longsome length of seven
years. As last one day of the days that Sultan went forth disguised
in Darwaysh-garb and toured about town unattended, and
ceased not walking until he reached and passed before the palace
of the Wazir, where he found a gathering of much folk, some
sweeping and others sprinkling water, and others spreading,<a id="r333"></a><a href="#f333" class="c012"><sup>[333]</sup></a>
whilst the Harem and household were in high glee and gladness.
He stood there amongst the spectators and presently asked what
was doing, and they informed him, saying, “The Wazir returneth
from abroad this night and folk have been informed by messenger
that the Sultan hath deigned restore him to favour and expressed
himself satisfied, so presently we shall see him once more at home.”
“Praise be to Allah!” quoth the King in his mind; “by the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_234">234</span>Almighty, this occurrence hath no cause, and how went the bruit
abroad that the King hath again accepted him? And now there
is no help but that I forgather with the Wazir and see what there
may be to do and how this occurred.” The Sultan increased in
disquietude therefor, so he went and bought a somewhat of bread
and repairing to the gaol (he being still in Fakir’s garb) accosted
the gaoler and said to him, “Allah upon thee, O my lord, open to
me the bridewell that I may enter and distribute this provaunt
among the prisoners, for that I have obliged myself to such course
by oath, and the cause is that when suffering from a sickness which
brought me nigh to death’s door I vowed a vow and sware a
strong swear that, an Almighty Allah deign heal me, I would buy
somewhat of bread and dole it out to the inmates of the gaol.<a id="r334"></a><a href="#f334" class="c012"><sup>[334]</sup></a>
So here am I come for such purpose.” Upon this the man opened
to him the door and he went in and all divided the bread
amongst the captives yet he saw not the Wazir; so he said to the
gaoler, “Hath any one remained that I may dole to him his
share?” “O Darwaysh,” said the other, “whereof askest thou?”
and said the Fakir, “O my lord, I have sworn an oath and Allah
upon thee, if there be among the captives any save these I have
seen, do thou tell me thereof.” Quoth the man, “There remaineth
none save the Wazir who is in another place, but indeed he is not
in want;” and quoth the Fakir, “O my lord, my desire is to free
myself from the obligation of mine oath.” Accordingly the gaoler
led him in to the Wazir and when the Darwaysh drew nigh the
visitor shrieked and fell fainting to the floor, and the warder seeing
him prostrate left him to himself and went his ways. Hereupon
the Minister came to him and sprinkling somewhat of water upon
his face said to him, “O Darwaysh, there is no harm to thee!”
So the Fakir arose and said, “O my lord, my heart hath been
<span class="pageno" id="Page_235">235</span>upon thee for a while of time;”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted

and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
Fakir to the Wazir, “By Allah, O my lord, my heart hath indeed
been with thee for this space of seven years; and often as I went
to thy mansion, they told me that the Sultan is wroth with the
Wazir; withal I still awaited for thee until this very day, when I
repaired to thy quarters according to my custom and I found in
thy house much folk, this sweeping and that sprinkling and that
spreading, and all were in joyous case. So I asked of the bystanders
and they informed me that the Sovran hath become satisfied
with thee and that on the ensuing night thou wilt hie thee home
for that this thy saying is soothfast.”<a id="r335"></a><a href="#f335" class="c012"><sup>[335]</sup></a> “O Darwaysh,” replied the
other, “’Tis true that I sent to my household and informed them
thereof, for that I have received welcome news from an event befel
me; so I bade apprise those at home that the Sultan is satisfied
with me; and to me, O Darwaysh, hath betided a matter wondrous
and an occurrence marvellous; were it written with needle-gravers
<span class="pageno" id="Page_236">236</span>upon the eye-corners it had been a warning to whoso would be
warned.” The Fakir asked, “And what may be that?” and the
other answered:—By Allah, O Darwaysh, the while I was in the
service of His Highness the King, I was a true counsellor to him
and pitiful to the lieges and I never deceived him nor did I betray
him at any time at all; and often as he sent me to a place wherein
were mutual strife and trouble and wrong and tyranny, I smoothed
matters and pacified the folk and righted wrongs amongst them by
the power of Almighty Allah. But one day of the days, my mind
was set upon riding out to the waste lands about the town and the
gardens thereof, by way of solacing myself; so I embarked in a
little caïque<a id="r336"></a><a href="#f336" class="c012"><sup>[336]</sup></a> upon the river and when we were amid stream I had
a longing for coffee;<a id="r337"></a><a href="#f337" class="c012"><sup>[337]</sup></a> so I said to the boatman, “Abide in this
place and throw out the anchor while we drink coffee.” Hereat
all my suite arose and busied themselves in preparing it until ’twas
ready and I had a finján<a id="r338"></a><a href="#f338" class="c012"><sup>[338]</sup></a> worth a treasury<a id="r339"></a><a href="#f339" class="c012"><sup>[339]</sup></a> of money which they
filled and passed to me. I took it as I was sitting upon the gunwale
of the boat whence it dropped into the stream; and I was sorely
<span class="pageno" id="Page_237">237</span>sorrowful therefor, because that cup was a souvenir. Seeing this,
all in the boat arose and sent for a diver who asked, saying, “In
what place hath the finjan fallen that I may seek it? and do ye
inform me of its whereabouts.” So we sought for a pebble in the
caïque but we found none, and as I wore upon my finger a signet-ring
which was worth two treasuries of money I drew it off and
cast it into the water crying, “The cup fell from me in this place.”
But when the ducker saw me throw my ring he said to me,
“Wherefore, O my lord, hast thou parted with thy seal?” and
said I to him, “The deed is done.” Then he went down and
plunged into the deep for a while and behold he came up grasping
the cup, in the middle of which we saw the signet-ring. Now
when this mighty great matter befel me, I said to myself, “Ho
certain person, there remaineth upon this good luck no better
luck; and haply there will befal thee somewhat contrary to this.”<a id="r340"></a><a href="#f340" class="c012"><sup>[340]</sup></a>
However those with me rejoiced at the finding of my two losses,
nor did any fear therefrom my change of state and downfall, but
they wondered and said, “By Allah, this is a rare matter!” Then
we went forward in the caïque until we had reached the place
intended, where we tarried the whole of that day and presently
returned home. But hardly was I settled and had I taken seat in
my home-quarters when behold, a party of Chamberlains of the
King’s suite came in to me and said, “The Sultan requireth thee!”
Accordingly, I arose and mounted horse and rode on till I had
come to the palace and entered the presence; and I designed to
offer suit and service to the King as was my wont, when suddenly
he cried, “Carry him away.” So they bore me off and confined
<span class="pageno" id="Page_238">238</span>me in this place, after which the Sultan sent and interdicted me from
eating a tittle of flesh food, and here I am after the space of seven
years, O Darwaysh, still in the same condition. Now on the morning
of this day my stomach craved for meat, so I said to the gaoler, “O
Such-and-such, ’tis now seven years since I tasted flesh, so take
this ashrafi and bring us an ounce of meat.” He accepted the
money saying, “’Tis well,” and went forth from me and brought
me my need.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting,
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that
the Wazir continued to the Fakir, “Then, O Darwaysh, we
divided the meat (I and the gaoler) with our fingers, and we
washed it and set it upon the hearth, building a fire beneath
it until it was cooked, when we took it off, and after waiting
awhile dished it up and were about to eat it.” But it happened
to be noon-tide, and the hour of incumbent orisons, so we
said, “Let us pray our prayers;” and we arose and made the
Wuzú ablution, and went through the mid-day devotions. After
this we set the plate before us; and I, removing its cover, put forth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_239">239</span>my hand to take up a bit of meat, but as I took it, behold, a mouse
passed over that same morsel with its tail and paws.<a id="r341"></a><a href="#f341" class="c012"><sup>[341]</sup></a> I cried,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah the
Glorious, the Great! I have divided this meat with my own hand
and have cooked it myself, so how could this matter have occurred?
However, Allah the Omniscient haply knoweth that the stumbling
stone hath been removed from my path,” and this I said, for when
I saw that mouse do on such wise I felt that glad news and good
tidings were coming from the Lord of the Heavens and the Earth.
So I sent to my home and informed them that the Sultan was
satisfied with me, for things when at their worst mend, and in
joyance end; and I opine, O Darwaysh, that all my troubles have
now ceased. Said to him the Fakir, “Alhamdolillah—Glory be to
God—O my lord, who hath sent thee forerunners of welfare.”
Then he arose from beside the Wazir, and went forth and ceased
not wending until he came to his palace where he doffed his disguise
and donned the garments of the Kings, and taking seat upon
the throne of his Kingship summoned the Wazir from his gaol in
all joy, and set him between his hands and gifted him with sumptuous
gifts. And all displeasure in the Sultan’s heart being
removed from the Wazir he committed to him once more the
management of all his affairs.<a id="r342"></a><a href="#f342" class="c012"><sup>[342]</sup></a> But when Ibn Ahyam (continued
Shahrazad) had ended his history of the Righteous Wazir he
presently began to tell the tale of</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_241">241</span>
  <h2 class="c006">THE CAIRENE YOUTH, THE BARBER, AND THE CAPTAIN.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_243">243</span>It is related that in Misr there was a Youth, a Shalabí,<a id="r343"></a><a href="#f343" class="c012"><sup>[343]</sup></a> sans peer
for semblance and excellence, and he had to friend a lovely woman
whose husband was a Yúzbáshí<a id="r344"></a><a href="#f344" class="c012"><sup>[344]</sup></a> or captain. Now whenever that
young man or his playmate would fain conjoin, each with other,
union proved almost impossible and yet his heart was always hanging
to her love and she was in similar state and even more enamoured,
for that he was passing fair of form and feature. One day of the
days the Captain returned home and said to his wife, “I am invited
to such a place this afternoon, therefore an thou require aught
ask it of me ere I go.” Cried they,<a id="r345"></a><a href="#f345" class="c012"><sup>[345]</sup></a> “We want nothing save thy
safety;” yet were they delighted therewith, and the youth’s friend
said, “Alhamdolillah—Glory to God—this day we will send to a
certain person and bring him hither and we will make merry he
and I.” As soon as the husband fared forth his home in order to
visit the gardens according to his invitation, the wife said to a
small boy which was an eunuch beside her, “Ho boy, hie thee to
Such-an-one (the Shalabi) and seek him till thou forgather with
him and say to him:—My lady salameth to thee and saith, Come
to her house at this moment.” So the little slave went from his
mistress and ceased not wending to seek the Shalabi (her friend) till
he found him in a barber’s booth where at that time it was his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_244">244</span>design to have his head shaved and he had ordered the shaver so
to do. The man said to him, “O, my lord, may this our day be
blessed!” whereupon he brought out from his budget a clean towel,
and going up to the Shalabi dispread it all about his breast.
Then he took his turband and hung it to a peg<a id="r346"></a><a href="#f346" class="c012"><sup>[346]</sup></a> and placing
a basin before him washed his pate, and was about to poll
it when behold, the boy-slave passed within softly pacing, and
inclining to him whispered in his ear confidentially between them
twain so that none might overhear them, “My lady So-and-so
sendeth thee many salams and biddeth me let thee know that to-day
the coast is clear, the Captain being invited out to a certain
place. Do thou come to her at once and if thou delay but a little
thou mayst not avail to possess her nor may she possess thee,
and if thou be really reminded to forgather with her come with
all speed.” Hearing these words of the boy the lover’s wits were
wildered and he could not keep patience; no, not for a minute;
and he cried to the Barber, “Dry my head this instant and I will
return to thee, for I am in haste to finish a requirement.” With
these words he put his hand into his breast pouch and pulling out
an ashrafi gave it to the Barber, who said in himself, “An he have
given me a gold-piece for wetting his poll, how will it be when I
shall have polled him? Doubtless he will then gift me with half a
score of dinars!” Hereupon the youth went forth from the Barber
who followed him saying, “Allah upon thee, O my lord, when
thou shalt have ended thy business, return to me that I may shave
thy scalp and ’twere better that thou come to the shop.” “Right
well,” said the youth, “we will presently return to thee,” and he
continued walking until he drew near the place of his playmate
when suddenly the Barber caught him up a second time——And
<span class="pageno" id="Page_245">245</span>Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the youth
approached the house of his friends, suddenly the Barber caught
him up hard by thereto and placing himself in front said, “Allah
upon thee, O my lord, do not forget me, but be sure of return to
the shop that I may poll thee.” Quoth the youth to him in his
folly, “’Tis well, O Man, I will certainly come back to thee and
will not forget thy shop.” So the lover left him and ganged his
gait and presently went up to the home of his friend, whilst the
Barber stayed expecting him and remained standing at the door;
and of the denseness of the tonsorial wits would not budge from
that place and would await the youth that he might shave him. Such
was the case with them; but as regards the Yuzbashi, when he went
forth from his house bent upon seeking his friend who had invited
him, he found that a serious matter of business<a id="r347"></a><a href="#f347" class="c012"><sup>[347]</sup></a> would hinder his
giving the entertainment, so the host said to the Captain, “Allah
upon thee, O my lord, pardon me for I have this day a matter
<span class="pageno" id="Page_246">246</span>which will prevent my going forth to the garden and Inshallah—God
willing—on the morrow we will there meet and enjoy ourselves,
we and thou, free and with hearts at rest; for a man who
hath work in hand may not take his pleasure and his thoughts
will remain ever preoccupied.” Hereupon quoth the Captain
“Sooth thou hast said, O Such-and-such, and herein there is naught
to excuse of harm or hindrance, and the day’s engagement between
us if it be not to-morrow will come after to-morrow.” So he farewelled
his host and left him and returned homewards. Now that
Yuzbashi was a man of honour and sagacity and pluck and spunk
and by nature a brave. He ceased not wending until he had
reached his home where he found the Barber standing at the
house-door and the fellow came up to him and said, “Allah, upon
thee, O my lord, when thou goest within do thou send me down
a handsome youth who went upstairs into this dwelling.” The
Yuzbashi turned upon him with a face fiery as ruddy sparks and
cried to him, “What, O Man, dost thou say that one hath gone up
to my house, O pimp, O pander?<a id="r348"></a><a href="#f348" class="c012"><sup>[348]</sup></a> What manner of man can
enter therein and I absent?” Quoth the Barber, “By Allah, O
my lord, one <em>did</em> go up whilst I stood awaiting him the while he
passed out of my sight; so when thou art abovestairs do thou send
him down to me, saying:—Thine own Barber awaiteth thee at the
entrance below.” Now when the Yuzbashi heard these words, he
waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and going up into his house
with haste and hurry knocked at the inner door which defended
the Harem. The inmates heard him and knew that it was he,
and the Youth fell to piddling in his bag-trowsers; but the woman
took him and hid him in the shaft of the cistern<a id="r349"></a><a href="#f349" class="c012"><sup>[349]</sup></a> and going forth
opened the door to her husband. Cried the Yuzbashi, “Of a truth,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_247">247</span>hath any right or reason to say that here in this house is a man?”<a id="r350"></a><a href="#f350" class="c012"><sup>[350]</sup></a>
and she replied, “Oh, the shame of me! How ever, O my lord, can
there be here a man?”<a id="r351"></a><a href="#f351" class="c012"><sup>[351]</sup></a> So the Yuzbashi went about seeking and
searching but he came not upon any; then he went down to the
Barber wight and cried, “O Man, I have found none upstairs save
the womenkind;” but the Barber replied, “By Allah, O my lord,
he went up before my eyes and I am still awaiting him.” Then
the Captain hurried away a second time and rummaged about,
high and low, and left no place whereinto he did not pry and spy,
yet he came upon no one. He was perplext at his affair and again
going down to the Barber said to him, “O Man, we have found
none.” Still the fellow said to him doggedly, “Withal a man <em>did</em>
go within, whilst I who am his familiar here stand expecting him,
and thou sayest forsooth he is not there, albeit he be abovestairs and
after he went in he never came out until this tide.” Hereupon the
Captain returned to his Harem a third time and a fourth time unto
the seventh time; but he found no one; so he was dazed and amazed
and the going in and faring out were longsome to him. All this
and the youth concealed in the cistern shaft lay listening to their
dialogue and he said, “Allah ruin this rascal Barber!” but he
was sore afraid and he quaked with fright lest the Yuzbashi slay
<span class="pageno" id="Page_248">248</span>him and also slay his wife. Now after the eighth time the Captain
came down to the Barber and said to him, “An thou saw him
enter, up along with me and seek for him.” The man did
accordingly, but when the two had examined every site, they came
upon no one; so the Barber was stupefied and said to himself,
“Whoso went up before me and I looking upon him, whither can
he have wended?” Then he fell to pondering and presently said,
“By Allah, verily this is a wondrous matter that we have not
discovered him;” but the Yuzbashi cried fiercely, “By the life of
my head and by Him who created all creatures and numbered the
numberings thereof, an I find not this fellow needs must I do thee
die.” The Barber of his exceeding terror fell to rummaging all
the places but it fortuned that he did not look into the shaft of the
cistern; however at last he said, “There remaineth for us only the
cistern-shaft;”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day, and fell silent, and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Barber
wight, after he and the Captain had finished their search without
finding anyone, said, “There remaineth to us only the cistern-shaft;”
so he went and peered therein, but he could not use his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_249">249</span>sight overwell. Hereat the Yuzbashi came up behind him and
cuffed him with a mighty cuff upon the neck and laid him
prostrate and insensible at the mouth of the shaft. Now when
the woman heard the Barber saying, “Let us explore the door
which openeth upon the cistern-shaft,” she feared from the Yuzbashi,
so coming up to him she said, “O my lord, how is it that
thou art a Captain and that thy worth and thy length and thy
breadth are on such wise; withal thou obeyest the word of a fellow
Jinn-mad<a id="r352"></a><a href="#f352" class="c012"><sup>[352]</sup></a> and sayest that there is a man in thine own house.
This is indeed a reproach to thee.” So the Yuzbashi of his
stupidity believed her, and approaching the Barber on the edge of
the cistern-shaft cuffed him with a cuff whose excess of violence
dazed him and he fell upon the floor retaining naught of his
senses. When the woman saw this she cried to her husband,
“Pinion his elbows at this moment and suffer me take my due
of him by a sound drubbing, and then let him go.” “This is
the right rede,” quoth he and after all was done she cried to her
husband, “Come with us above that we enjoy our pleasure, and
Alhamdolillah that thou didst not go to the place of invitation for
I should have been desolate by thine absence this day.” So they
ascended and sat together, each beside other, and they sported and
were gladdened and rejoiced; and after that the Captain lay down
and was presently drowned in slumber. Seeing this the wife arose
and repaired to the cistern-shaft wherefrom she released her
beloved and finding all his clothes in a filthy state from the excess
of what had befallen him of affright penetrating into his heart by
reason of the Yuzbashi, she doffed his dress and bringing a bundle
of clean clothing garbed him therein; after which his fear was
calmed and his heart comforted and he was set on the right way.
Then she led him to a private stead, wherein they twain, he and
she, took their joyance and had their pleasure and made merry for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_250">250</span>the space of three hours, till such time as each had had fullest will
of other. After this he went forth from her and the Veiler veiled
him. On such wise were the wife’s doings; but as regards what
befel the Barber-man, he ceased not to remain strown on the
ground and dazed by the stress of the blow and he abode there
pinioned for a while. About mid-afternoon the Yuzbashi’s wife
went to her husband and awaking him from sleep made for him
coffee which he drank and felt cheered; and he knew nothing
anent that his spouse had done with her beloved during the while
he slumbered like unto a he-goat. So she said to him, “Rise up and
go we to the man and do thou drub him with the soundest drubbing
and turn him out.” Quoth he, “Yes indeed, by Allah verily
he deserveth this, the pimp! the pander! the procuror!” Accordingly
he went to him and finding him lying upon the ground
raised him and said to him, “Up with thee and let us seek the
man whereof thou spakest.” Hereupon the Barber arose and
went down into the cistern-shaft where he found none and therewith
the Captain laid the fellow upon his back; and, baring his arms
to his elbows, seized a Nabbút<a id="r353"></a><a href="#f353" class="c012"><sup>[353]</sup></a> and beat him till he made water in
his bag-trousers; after which he let him go. So the Barber arose
and he in doleful dumps, and went off from the house and ceased
not wending until he reached his shop about sunset, hardly
believing in his own safety. But (resumed Shahrazad) as regards
the history of the woman who was a fornicatress and an adultress,
I have to relate to thee the following story of</p>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_253">253</span>It is said that in Misr lived a woman, a model of beauty and
loveliness and stature and perfect grace, who had a difficulty with a
man which was a Kazi and after this fashion it befel. She was the
wife of an Emir<a id="r355"></a><a href="#f355" class="c012"><sup>[355]</sup></a> and she was wont to visit the Baths once a
month; and when the appointed term for her going forth had come,
she adorned herself and perfumed herself and beautified herself
and hastened, tripping and stumbling,<a id="r356"></a><a href="#f356" class="c012"><sup>[356]</sup></a> to the Hammám. Now
her path passed by the Kazi’s court-house where she saw many
a man<a id="r357"></a><a href="#f357" class="c012"><sup>[357]</sup></a> and she stopped to enjoy the spectacle, upon which the
Judge himself glanced at her with a glance of eyes that bequeathed
to him a thousand sighs and he asked her saying, “O woman,
hast thou any want?” “No indeed,” answered she, “I have none.”
Then he inclined to her and drawing near her said, “O lady
mine and O light of these eyne, is union possible between us
twain?” She replied, “’Tis possible” and he enquired of her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_254">254</span>when it could be, and she made an appointment with him saying,
“Do thou come to me after supper-time,”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Goodwife
said to the Kazi, “Do thou come to me after supper-time,” and
went her ways and entered the Hammam, where she washed herself
and cleaned herself; then, coming out thence, she determined
to go home. But she was met on her road by a Gentleman<a id="r358"></a><a href="#f358" class="c012"><sup>[358]</sup></a> who
was Sháhbandar of the Trader-guild, and he seeing her set his
affections upon her; so he accosted her, saying, “Is’t possible that
we ever be merry together?” Hereat she appointed him to come
when supper was done, after which she left him and ganged her
gait. As she neared her home she was met by a Butcher whose
heart inclined to her, so he addressed her saying, “Is union possible?”
and she appointed him to visit her an hour after supper
had been eaten. Then she went home and mounting the stairs
<span class="pageno" id="Page_255">255</span>took seat in the upper saloon open to the air, where she doffed
her head-veil<a id="r359"></a><a href="#f359" class="c012"><sup>[359]</sup></a> and all that was upon her head. Now in the neighbourhood
of her house was a Trader and he had mounted to
the terrace-roof for a reason; so when the woman bared her
hair and taking up a comb began to dry and prepare it for
dressing, his eyes fell upon her whilst so engaged, and his heart
was engrossed with her love. Presently he sent to her an old
woman; and she returned him a reply and appointed him to visit
her house during the night after supper-tide. On this wise she had
promised herself to four men.<a id="r360"></a><a href="#f360" class="c012"><sup>[360]</sup></a> Now the Kazi had got ready for
her a Kohl-style and the Gentleman had prepared for her a fine
suit of clothes and the Butcher had led for her a full-sized ram
and the Trader had set apart for her two pieces of silk. As soon
as it was supper-time, behold, the Kazi repaired to her in privacy
bringing his gift and knocked at the door which he found unbolted
and she cried to him, “Come in.” Accordingly he entered
to her and presented to her that which was with him, but hardly
had he settled himself comfortably in his seat when the Gentleman
arrived and also rapped. Quoth the Kazi to the Goodwife,
“Who may this be?” and quoth she, “Fear thou nothing, but
arise and doff thy dress;” so he stripped himself altogether and
she garbed him in a gaberdine and bonnet<a id="r361"></a><a href="#f361" class="c012"><sup>[361]</sup></a> and hid him in a closet
and went to open the door. Hereupon appeared the Consul and
she let him in and accepted what he had brought and seated
<span class="pageno" id="Page_256">256</span>him beside her. But hardly had he settled down when, behold,
there came a knock at the door and he cried, “Who may that be?”
Said she, “Fear nothing but up and doff thy dress;” so he arose
and stripped himself and she disguised him in a gaberdine and
bonnet and hid him in another closet all alone. Then she
hastened to the door and suddenly the Flesher-man appeared and
she let him in and led him within and having accepted his present
seated him; but hardly was he at his ease when the door was again
knocked, whereat he was overcome and affrighted: however, she
said to him, “Fear nothing, but arise and doff thy dress in order
that I may hide thee.” So he threw off his clothes and she invested
him in a gaberdine and a bonnet and thrust him into a
third cabinet. After this she went and opened the door when
there came to her the Trader who was her neighbour, so she let
him in and took what was with him, and seated him; and he was
proceeding to sit down in comfort when behold, some one knocked
at the door and he said, “Who may that be?” Hereupon she
cried, “Oh my honour! Oh my calamity! This is my husband
who but yesterday<a id="r362"></a><a href="#f362" class="c012"><sup>[362]</sup></a> killed off four men; however do thou rise up
and doff thy dress.” He did as she bade him, upon which she
garbed him in a gaberdine and a bonnet and laid him in a fourth
closet. So these four one and all found themselves in as many
cabinets<a id="r363"></a><a href="#f363" class="c012"><sup>[363]</sup></a> sorely sorrowful and fearful; but she went forth and
suddenly her mate the Emir came in and took seat upon a chair
that was in the house. Hereat all four sensed that she had opened
to her husband and had admitted him; and they said in their
minds, “Yesterday he killed four men and now he will kill me.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_257">257</span>And each and every considered his own affair and determined in
his mind what should happen to him from the husband. Such
was the case with these four; but as regards the house-master,
when he took seat upon the chair, he fell to chatting with his wife
and asking her saying, “What hast thou seen this day during thy
walk to the Hammam?” Said she, “O my lord, I have witnessed
four adventures and on every one hangeth a wondrous tale!” Now
when the four heard the Goodwife speaking these words each of
them said to himself, “Indeed I am a dead man and ’tis the
intention of this woman to peach upon me.” Presently her
husband asked her, “What be these four histories?” and answered
she, “I saw four men each and every of whom was an antic fellow,
a droll, a buffoon; furthermore, O my lord, one and all of them
were garbed in gaberdine and bonnet.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the woman
said to her husband, “Moreover each of the four was habited in
gaberdine and bonnet.” But when the amourists heard these
words every one of them said to himself, “Here be a judgment
this strumpet of a woman hath wrought upon us, the whore! the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_258">258</span>witch!” and her husband understanding what she told him asked,
“Wherefore didst thou not bring them hither that the sight might
solace us?” “O my lord,” answered she, “had I brought them
what hadst thou said to them? indeed I fear me thou wouldst
have slain them!” And he, “No indeed; I would not have
killed them, for they are but buffoon-folk, and we should have
enjoyed their harlequinades and would have made them dance to
us a wee and all and some tell us tales to gladden our minds;
after which we would have suffered them depart and go about
their own business.” The wife enquired, “And given that they
knew neither dancing nor story-telling what hadst thou done with
them?” and replied he, “Had the case been as thou sayest and
they ignorant of all this, verily we would have killed them and
cast them into the chapel of ease.” The four men hearing such
threatening words muttered to themselves, “There is no Majesty
and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great;”
but the Kazi said in his mind, “How remain Judge of this city
when I shall have been found garbed in gaberdine and bonnet and
dancing and tale-telling? and indeed this is the greater death.
Allah bring to ruin this adulteress of a woman!” Then the
Flesher took thought as follows, “How shall I continue to be
Chief of the Butchers when I prance about with a bonnet on my
pate? this is indeed a painful penalty!” Then quoth the Gentleman,
the Consul, “How shall it be with me when I am seen
dancing and donning a bonnet? indeed death by the sword were
lighter than this!” Then muttered the Trader which was the
woman’s neighbour, “’Tis easier to kill myself with my own hand
than to endure all such ill.” Anon the woman said to her husband,
“Inshallah—God willing—on the morrow we will bring them
hither to thy house that we may solace ourselves therewith;” but
said he, “Walláhi, hadst thou brought them this night ’twere
better, for that to-morrow evening I have business in the house of
the Chief Emir.” Quoth she to him, “Now grant me immunity
<span class="pageno" id="Page_259">259</span>and give me permission and I will arise and bring them to thee at
this moment, but each must come to thee alone and by himself.”
Quoth he, “O Woman, leave I do give thee and immunity I do
grant thee;” whereupon she rose without stay or delay and went
to the closet wherein was the Judge. Then she opened it and
entered, and taking him by the hand dragged him forward and
came out with him and set him before her spouse garbed as he was
in gaberdine and bonnet. The house-master scrutinised him and
was certified of his being the Kazi and said to him, “Blessed be
to thee, O our lord, this bonnet and this gaberdine which become
thee passing well.” But the Judge, as he stood before the presence
of the woman’s husband, bowed his front downwards and was
clothed as with a garment in the sweat of shame and was sore
abashed, when the Emir said to him, “O our lord the Kazi, do thou
dance for us a wee the baboon dance and rejoice us; after which
performance do thou tell us a tale that our breasts may thereby be
broadened.” But when the man said this to him, the Judge feared
for his life because he had heard and well remembered the words
of the householder and he fell to clapping his palms and prancing
to right and left. Hereupon the Emir laughed consumedly, he and
his wife, and they signed and signalled each to other deriding the
judicial dance, and the Kazi ceased not skipping, until he fell to
the floor for his fatigue. Hereupon the man said to him, “Basta!
Now tell us thy tale that we may rejoice thereat; then do thou
rise up and go about thy business.” “Hearkening and obedience,”
said the Judge and forthright he began to relate the adventure of</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE TAILOR AND THE LADY AND THE CAPTAIN.<a id="r364"></a><a href="#f364" class="c012"><sup>[364]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_263">263</span>It is related that a Tailor was sitting in his shop facing a tall
house tenanted by a Yúzbáshi, and this man had a wife who was
unique for beauty and loveliness. Now one day of the days as
she looked out at the latticed window the Snip espied her and
was distraught by her comeliness and seemlihead. So he became
engrossed by love of her and remained all day a-gazing at the
casement disturbed and perturbed, and as often as she approached
the window and peered out therefrom, he would stare at her and
say to her, “O my lady and O core of my heart, good morning to
thee; and do thou have mercy upon one sore affected by his
affection to thee; one whose eyes sleep not by night for thy fair
sake.” “This pimp be Jinn-mad!” quoth the Captain’s wife,
“and as often as I look out at the window he dareth bespeak me:
haply the folk shall say:—Indeed she must needs be his mistress.”
But the Tailor persevered in this proceeding for a while of days
until the lady was offended thereby and said in her mind,
“Walláhi, there is no help but that I devise for him a device
which shall make unlawful to him this his staring and casting
sheep’s eyes at my casement; nay more, I will work for ousting
him from his shop.” So one day of the days when the Yuzbashi
went from home, his wife arose and adorned and beautified herself,
and donning the bestest of what dresses and decorations she had,
despatched one of her slave-girls to the Tailor instructing her to
say to him:—“My lady salameth to thee and biddeth thee come
and drink coffee with her.” The handmaiden went to his shop and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_264">264</span>delivered the message; and he, when hearing these words,<a id="r365"></a><a href="#f365" class="c012"><sup>[365]</sup></a> waxed
bewildered of wits and rose up quivering in his clothes;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Forty-third Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the Tailor
heard the girl’s words, he quivered in his clothes; but indeed he
recked not aught of the wiles of womankind. So after padlocking
his shop he went with her to the house and walked upstairs,
where he was met by the lady with a face like the rondure of the
moon and she greeted him right merrily, and taking him by the
hand led him to a well-mattressed Divan and bade her slave-girl
serve him with coffee, and as he drank it she sat facing him.
Presently the twain fell to conversing, she and he; and she soothed
him with sweet speech, whilst he went clean out of his mind for
the excess of her beauty and loveliness. This lasted until near
midday, when she bade serve the dinner-trays, and took seat in
front of him, and he began picking up morsels<a id="r366"></a><a href="#f366" class="c012"><sup>[366]</sup></a> designed for his
lips and teeth, but in lieu thereof thrust them into his eye. She
<span class="pageno" id="Page_265">265</span>laughed at him, but hardly had he swallowed the second mouthful
and the third when behold, the door was knocked, whereupon she
looked out from the casement and cried, “Oh my honour! this is
my husband.” Hereat the man’s hands and knees began to quake,
and he said to her, “Whither shall I wend?” Said she, “Go
into this closet,” and forthright she thrust him into a cabinet and
shot the bolt upon him and taking the key she tare out one of
its teeth<a id="r367"></a><a href="#f367" class="c012"><sup>[367]</sup></a> and put it in her pocket. After this she went down
and opened the door to her husband who walked upstairs; and
finding the dinner trays bespread, asked her, “What is this?”
She answered, “I and my lover have been dining together.”
“And what may be thy lover?” “Here he is.”<a id="r368"></a><a href="#f368" class="c012"><sup>[368]</sup></a> “Where may
he be?” to which she replied, “He is inside this closet.” Now
as soon as the Tailor heard her say this say, he piddled in his
bag-breeches and befouled himself and he was in a filthy state
with skite and piss.<a id="r369"></a><a href="#f369" class="c012"><sup>[369]</sup></a> Hereupon the Captain asked, “And where’s
the key?” and she answered, “Here it is with me.”<a id="r370"></a><a href="#f370" class="c012"><sup>[370]</sup></a> “Bring it
out,” said he, so she pulled it from her pocket and handed it to
him. The Captain took the key from his spouse and applying it
to the wooden bolt of the cabinet rattled it to and fro<a id="r371"></a><a href="#f371" class="c012"><sup>[371]</sup></a> but it
would not open; so the wife came up to him and cried, “Allah
upon thee, O my lord, what wilt thou do with my playmate?” Said
<span class="pageno" id="Page_266">266</span>he, “I will slay him!” and said she, “No, ’tis my opinion that thou
hadst better pinion him and bind him as if crucified to the pillar
in the court floor and then smite him with thy sword upon the neck
and cut off his head; for I, during my born days, never saw a
criminal put to death and now ’tis my desire to sight one done
to die.” “Sooth is thy speech,” quoth he: so he took the key and
fitting it into the wooden bolt would have drawn it back, but it
could not move because a tooth had been drawn therefrom and
the while he was rattling at the bolt his wife said to him, “O my
lord, ’tis my desire that thou lop off his hands and his feet until
he shall become marked by his maims;<a id="r372"></a><a href="#f372" class="c012"><sup>[372]</sup></a> and after do thou smite
his neck.” “A sensible speech,” cried the husband and during
the whole time her mate was striving to pull the bolt she kept
saying to him, “Do this and do that with the fellow,” and he
ceased not saying to her, “’Tis well.” All this and the Tailor sat
hearkening to their words and melting in his skin; but at last the
wife burst out laughing until she fell upon her back and her
husband asked her, “Whereat this merriment?” Answered she,
“I make mock of thee for that thou art wanting in wits and wisdom.”
Quoth he, “Wherefore?” and quoth she, “O my lord, had I a
lover and had he been with me should I have told aught of him to
thee? Nay; I said in my mind:—Do such and such with the
Captain and let’s see whether he will believe or disbelieve. Now
when I spake thou didst credit me and it became apparent to me
that thou art wanting in wits.” Cried he to her, “Allah disappoint
thee! Dost thou make jibe and jape of me? I also said
in my thoughts:—How can a man be with her and she speak of
him in the face of me?” So he arose and took seat with her, the
twain close together, at the dinner-tray and she fell to morselling
him and he to morselling her, and they laughed and ate until
they had their sufficiency and were filled; then they washed their
<span class="pageno" id="Page_267">267</span>hands and drank coffee. After this they were cheered and they
toyed together and played the two-backed beast until their
pleasure was fulfilled and this was about mid-afternoon——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Yuzbashi fell
to toying with his wife, and thrusting and foining at her cleft<a id="r373"></a><a href="#f373" class="c012"><sup>[373]</sup></a>, her
solution of continuity, and she wriggled to and fro to him, and
bucked up and down, after which he tumbled her and both were

<span class="pageno" id="Page_268">268</span>and went forth to the Hammam. But as soon as he left the house
she opened the cabinet and brought out the Tailor, saying, “Hast
thou seen what awaiteth thee, O pander, O impure? Now, by
Allah, an thou continue staring at the windows or durst bespeak
me with one single word it shall be the death of thee. This time
I have set thee free, but a second time I will work to the wasting of
thy heart’s blood.” Cried he, “I will do so no more; no, never!”
Thereupon said she to her slave-girl, “O handmaid, open to him the
door;” and she did so, and he fared forth (and he foully bewrayed
as to his nether garments) until he had returned to his shop. Now
when the Emir heard the tale of the Kazi, he rejoiced thereat and
said to him, “Up and gang thy gait!” so the Judge went off garbed
in his gaberdine and bonnet. Then said the house-master to his
wife, “This be one of the four, where’s Number Two?” Hereat
<span class="pageno" id="Page_269">269</span>she arose and opened the closet in which was the Gentleman and
led him out by the hand till he stood before her husband, who
looked hard at him and was certified of him and recognised him
as the Shâhbandar; so he said to him, “O Khawájah, when didst
thou make thee a droll?”<a id="r375"></a><a href="#f375" class="c012"><sup>[375]</sup></a> but the other returned to him neither
answer nor address and only bowed his brow groundwards. Quoth
the house-master to him, “Dance for us a wee and when thou
shalt have danced do thou tell us a tale.” So he fell perforce to
clapping his hands and skipping about until he fell down of fatigue
when he said, “O my lord, there is with me a rare story, and an
exceeding strange if thou of thy grace accord attention to my
words.” “Tell on and I will listen to thee,” quoth the other,
whereupon said the Gentleman, “’Tis concerning the wiles of
womankind,” and fell to relating the adventures of</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE SYRIAN AND THE THREE WOMEN OF CAIRO.<a id="r377"></a><a href="#f377" class="c012"><sup>[377]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_273">273</span>There was a man, a Shámí, who came to the God-guarded city of
Misr al-Káhirah—Misr of Mars—and with him was a store of
money and merchandize and sumptuous clothing. He hired for
himself a room in a caravanserai, and having no slave, he was
wont to go forth every day and roam about the city-thoroughfares
and cater for himself. Now this continued for a while of time
till one day of the days, as he was wandering and diverting his
mind by looking to the right and to the left, he was met on the
way by three women who were leaning and swaying one towards
other as they walked on laughing aloud; and each and every of
the three surpassed her fellow in beauty and loveliness. When he
looked at them his mustachios curled<a id="r378"></a><a href="#f378" class="c012"><sup>[378]</sup></a> at the sight and he
accosted them and addressed the trio, saying, “May it be that ye
will drink coffee in my lodging?” “Indeed we will,” said they,
“and we will make mirth with thee and exceeding merriment,
passing even the will of thee.” Quoth he, “When shall it be?”
and quoth they, “To-night we will come to thy place.” He continued,
“I am living in a room of Such-and-such a Wakálah.”<a id="r379"></a><a href="#f379" class="c012"><sup>[379]</sup></a>
<span class="pageno" id="Page_274">274</span>and they rejoined, “Do thou make ready for us supper and we
will visit thee after the hour of night-prayers.” He cried, “These
words are well;” so they left him and went their ways; and he,
on the return way home, bought flesh and greens and wine and
perfumes; then, having reached his room, he cooked five kinds of
meats without including rice and conserves, and made ready
whatso for the table was suitable. Now when it was supper-time
behold, the women came in to him, all three wearing capotes<a id="r380"></a><a href="#f380" class="c012"><sup>[380]</sup></a>
over their dresses, and when they had entered they threw these
cloaks off their shoulders and took their seats as they were moons.
Hereupon the Syrian arose and set before them the food-trays
and they ate their sufficiency, after which he served to them the
table of wine, whereat they filled and passed to him and he
accepted and swilled until his head whirled round, and as often
<span class="pageno" id="Page_275">275</span>as he looked at any one of them and considered her in her mould
of beauty and loveliness he was perplext and his wits were wildered.
They ceased not to be after such fashion until the noon o’ night,——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Syrian and the three ladies ceased not to persevere in the drinking
of wine until the noon o’ night, at which time he would not
distinguish between masculine and feminine from the excess of
his wine-bibbing, so he said to one of the three, “Allah, upon
thee, O my lady, what may be the name of thee?” She replied,
“I am hight ’Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me?’” Whereat he exclaimed,
“No, Walláhi!” Then he up-propped himself on his
elbow and rising from the ground said to the second, “Thou, O
my lady, and life-blood of my heart, what is thy name?”
She answered, “I am hight, ’Never-sawest-thou-my-like,’” and
he replied, “Inshallah—what Allah willeth—O my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like.”
Then said he to the third, “And thou, O
dearling of my heart, what may be the name of thee?” And
said she, “I am hight ’Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.’”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_276">276</span>When he heard these words he cried out with a loud outcry and
fell to the ground saying, “No, by Allah, O my lady, Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.”<a id="r381"></a><a href="#f381" class="c012"><sup>[381]</sup></a>
But when the three women regarded
him his reason was upset and they forced upon him more wine-bibbing
whilst he cried to them, “Fill for me, ho my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like,
and thou too, my lady Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me,
and eke thou, O my lady Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.”
And they drove him to drink still more until he fell
to the ground without a vein swelling<a id="r382"></a><a href="#f382" class="c012"><sup>[382]</sup></a> for he had become drunken
and dead drunk. When they saw him in this condition they doffed
his turband and crowned him with a cap, and fringes projecting
from the peak,<a id="r383"></a><a href="#f383" class="c012"><sup>[383]</sup></a> which they had brought with them; then they
arose and finding in his room a box full of raiment and ready
money, they rifled all that was therein. Presently they donned
their dresses and, waiting until the door of the Wakalah was
opened after the call to the morning-prayer, they went their ways
and the Veiler vouchsafed them protection<a id="r384"></a><a href="#f384" class="c012"><sup>[384]</sup></a> and they left the
Syrian man in his room strown as a tried toper and unknowing
what the women had done with him of their wile and guile. Now
when it was the undurn-hour he awoke from his crapula and
opening his eyes, cried, “Ho my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like!
and ho my lady Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me! and ho my lady
Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know me!” But none returned to
him any reply. Then he pulled himself together and glanced
carefully around but his sight fell not upon anyone beside him, so
he arose and went to the box wherein he found never a single thing.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_277">277</span>This restored him to his right senses and he recovered from his
drink and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great: this be a judgment they have
wrought for me.” Then he went forth still wearing the tall fringed
cap and knowing nothing of himself and, when he had issued from
his caravanserai, he cried to everyone he met in the streets, “I
am seeking Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me?” and the men would
reply, “No, I never sighted the like of thee;” and to a second he
would say, “I am looking for one Never-sawest-thou-aught-like-me;”
and the other would answer, “Indeed, I never beheld thy
fellow;” then he would ask a third “Hast thou seen one Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me?”
and the questioned would answer,
“Indeed, I have looked at thee but I know thee not at all.” And
he ceased not wandering about, bonnet on head, and everyone
who met him by the way returned him the like replies until he
came upon a party of folk who were in front of a barber’s booth.<a id="r385"></a><a href="#f385" class="c012"><sup>[385]</sup></a>
There he cried upon them also, “Ah! Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me!
and Ah! Never-sawest-thou-my-like! and Ah! Look upon-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me!”
Hereat, understanding that he was
touched in brain and this was a judgment that had been wrought
upon him, they seized him and forced him into the barber’s shop
and bringing a mirror set it in his hands. When he looked therein
he found a fool’s cap upon his head, so forthwith he tore it off and
took thought and said to those present, “Who of you can guide
me to those three women?” They said to him, “O Syrian,
march off with thyself to thy own land for that the folk of Egypt
can play with the egg and the stone.”<a id="r386"></a><a href="#f386" class="c012"><sup>[386]</sup></a> So he arose without stay
and delay; then, taking what provaunt was sufficient for the way
and what little of fine raiment had been left to him, he quitted
Cairo intending for his own country. Now the Emir hearing this
tale of the Shahbandar wondered thereof with extreme wonderment
<span class="pageno" id="Page_278">278</span>and said to the Gentleman, “An thou have finished do thou
fare forth and go about thy business.” Accordingly he went from
him still garbed in gaberdine and bonnet on head when the house-master
asked his wife, “Who of them here remaineth with thee?”
And she answered, “Have patience and I will bring thee the
third.” So she arose and opening another closet summoned the
Flesher and taking him by the hand, whilst he was ashamed and
abashed, led him till he stood before her spouse and the poor
fellow availed not to raise his eyes from the ground. Presently
the husband considered him and knew him and was certified that
he was Such-and-such the Chief Butcher and head of the craft, so
he said to him, “Ho thou the clever one, do thou dance for us a
wee and after that tell us a tale.” Accordingly he stood up and
clapped hands and fell to dancing and prancing till such time as
he dropped down for fatigue; after which he said, “O my lord, I
have by me a tale anent the craft and cunning of women.” Asked
the other, “And what may it be?” and the Butcher began to relate
the tale of</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_279">279</span>
  <h2 class="c006">THE LADY WITH TWO COYNTES.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_281">281</span>It is told of a woman which was a fornicatress and adulteress and
a companion of catastrophes and calamities that she was married
to a Káim-makám<a id="r387"></a><a href="#f387" class="c012"><sup>[387]</sup></a> who had none of the will of mankind to
womankind, at all, at all. Now the wife was possessed of beauty
and loveliness and she misliked him for that he had no desire to
carnal copulation, and there was in the house a Syce-man who was
dying for his love of her. But her husband would never quit his
quarters, and albeit her longing was that the horse-keeper might
possess her person and that she and he might lie together, this
was impossible to her. She abode perplext for some sleight
wherewith she might serve her mate, and presently she devised a
device and said to him, “O my lord, verily my mother is dead
and ’tis my wish to hie me and be present at her burial and
receive visits of condolence for her; and, if she have left aught
by way of heritage, to take it and then fare back to thee.” “Thou
mayest go,” said he, and said she, “I dread to fare abroad alone and
unattended; nor am I able to walk, my parent’s house being afar.
Do thou cry out to the Syce that he fetch me hither an ass and
accompany me to the house of my mother, wherein I shall lie some
three nights after the fashion of folk.” Hereupon he called to the
horse-keeper and when he came before him, ordered the man to
bring an ass<a id="r388"></a><a href="#f388" class="c012"><sup>[388]</sup></a> and mount his mistress and hie with her; and the
fellow, hearing these words, was hugely delighted. So he did as
<span class="pageno" id="Page_282">282</span>he was bidden, but instead of going to the house they twain, he
and she, repaired to a garden carrying with them a flask of wine
and disappeared for the whole day and made merry and took their
pleasure<a id="r389"></a><a href="#f389" class="c012"><sup>[389]</sup></a> until set of sun. Then the man brought up the ass
and mounting her thereon went to his own home, where the twain
passed the entire night sleeping in mutual embrace on each other’s
bosoms, and took their joyance and enjoyment until it was
morning tide. Hereupon he arose and did with her as before,
leading her to the garden, and the two, Syce and dame, ceased
not to be after this fashion for three days solacing themselves and
making merry and tasting of love-liesse. On the fourth day
he said to her, “Do thou return with us to the house of the
Kaim-makam,” and said she, “No; not till we shall have spent
together three days more enjoying ourselves, I and thou, and
making merry till such time as I have had my full will of thee
and thou thy full will of me; and leave we yon preposterous pimp
to lie stretched out, as do the dogs,<a id="r390"></a><a href="#f390" class="c012"><sup>[390]</sup></a> enfolding his head between his
two legs.” So the twain ceased not amusing themselves and taking
their joyance and enjoyment until they had ended the six days,
and on the seventh they wended their way home. They found the
Kaim-makam sitting beside a slave which was an old negress;
and quoth he, “You have disappeared for a long while!” and
quoth she, “Yes, until we had ended with the visits of condolence
for that my mother was known to foyson of the folk. But, O my
lord, my parent (Allah have ruth upon her!) hath left and
bequeathed to me a somewhat exceeding nice.” “What may
that be?” asked he, and answered she, “I will not tell thee aught
thereof at this time, nor indeed until we remain, I and thou, in
privacy of night, when I will describe it unto thee.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_283">283</span>ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
woman said to her husband, “My mother hath left and bequeathed
to me somewhat, but I will not tell thee thereof till the
coming night when we twain shall be alone.” “’Tis well,” said he;
after which he continued to address himself, “Would Heaven I
knew what hath been left by the mother of our Harím!”<a id="r391"></a><a href="#f391" class="c012"><sup>[391]</sup></a> Now
when darkness came on and he and she had taken seats together,
he asked her, “What may be the legacy thy mother left?” and she
answered, “O my lord, my mother hath bequeathed to me her
Coynte being loath that it be given to other save myself and therefore
I have brought it along with me.” Quoth he of his stupidity
(for he was like unto a cosset),<a id="r392"></a><a href="#f392" class="c012"><sup>[392]</sup></a> “Ho thou, solace me with the sight
of thy mother’s Coynte.” Hereupon she arose; and, doffing all she
had on her of dress until she was mother-naked, said to him, “O my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_284">284</span>lord, I have stuck on my mother’s Coynte hard by and in continuation
of mine own cleft and so the twain of them have
remained each adjoining other between my hips.” He continued,
“Let me see it;” so she stood up before him and pointing to her
parts, said, “This which faceth thee is my coynte whereof thou
art owner;” after which she raised her backside and bowing her
head groundwards showed the nether end of her slit between the
two swelling cheeks of her sit-upon, her seat of honour, crying,
“Look thou! this be the Coynte of my mother; but, O my lord,
’tis my wish that we wed it unto some good man and pleasant
who is faithful and true and not likely treason to do, for that the
coynte of my mother must abide by me and whoso shall intermarry
therewith I also must bow down to him whilst he shall
have his will thereof.” Quoth the Kaim-makam, “O sensible say!
but we must seek and find for ourselves a man who shall be agreeable
and trustworthy,” presently adding, “O woman, we will not
give the Coynte of thy mother in marriage to some stranger lest
he trouble thee and trouble me also; so let us bestow this boon
upon our own Syce.” Replied the wife of her craft and cursedness,
“Haply, O my lord, the horsekeeper will befit us not;” yet
the while she had set her heart upon him. Rejoined the Kaim-makam
her husband, “If so it be that he have shown thee want
of respect we will surely relieve him of his lot.” But after so
speaking he said a second time, “’Tis better that we give the Coynte
of thy mother to the Syce;” and she retorted, “Well and good!
but do thou oblige him that he keep strait watch upon himself.”
Hereat the man summoned his servant before him and
said to him, “Hear me, O Syce; verily the mother of my wife
to her hath bequeathed her Coynte, and ’tis our intent to bestow it
upon thee in lawful wedlock; yet beware lest thou draw near that
which is our own property.” The horsekeeper answered, “No, O
my lord, I never will.” Now after they arrived at that agreement
concerning the matter in question, whenever the wife waxed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_285">285</span>hot with heat of lust she would send for the Syce and take him
and repair with him, he and she, to a place of privacy within the
Harem, whilst her mate remained sitting thoroughly satisfied,
and they would enjoy themselves to the uttermost, after which the
twain would come forth together. And the Kaim-makam never
ceased saying on such occasions, “Beware, O Syce, lest thou
poach upon that which is my property;” and at such times the
wife would exclaim, “By Allah, O my lord, he is a true man and
a trusty.” So they continued for a while<a id="r393"></a><a href="#f393" class="c012"><sup>[393]</sup></a> in the enjoyment of
their luxury and this was equally pleasurable to the husband and
wife and the lover. Now when the Emir heard this tale from the
Butcher, he began laughing until he fell upon his back and anon
he said to him, “Wend thy ways about thine own work;” so the
Flesher went forth from him not knowing what he should do in
his garb of gaberdine and bonnet. Hereupon the woman arose
and going to the fourth closet threw it open and summoned and
led the Trader man by the hand and set him before her husband
who looked hard at him in his droll’s dress and recognised him
and was certified of him that he was his neighbour. So he said,
“Ho Such-an-one! Thou art our neighbour and never did we
suspect that thou wouldst strive to seduce our Harím;<a id="r394"></a><a href="#f394" class="c012"><sup>[394]</sup></a> nay rather
did we expect thee to keep watch and ward over us and fend off
from us all evil.<a id="r395"></a><a href="#f395" class="c012"><sup>[395]</sup></a> Now by Allah, those whom we have dismissed
wrought us no foul wrong even as thou wroughtest us in this
affair; for thou at all events art our neighbour. Thou deservest
<span class="pageno" id="Page_286">286</span>in this matter that I slay thee out of hand, but Default cometh not
save from the Defaulter; therefore I will do thee no harm at all
as did I with thy fellows even save that needs must thou tell us a
tale whereby to rejoice us.”<a id="r396"></a><a href="#f396" class="c012"><sup>[396]</sup></a> Quoth he, “Hearing and obeying,”

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_289">289</span>It is related that once upon a time there was a man which was an
astronomer<a id="r397"></a><a href="#f397" class="c012"><sup>[397]</sup></a> and he had a wife who was singular in beauty and
loveliness. Now she was ever and aye boasting and saying to
him, “O man, there is not amongst womankind my peer in
nobility<a id="r398"></a><a href="#f398" class="c012"><sup>[398]</sup></a> and chastity;” and as often as she repeated this saying
to him he would give credit to her words and cry, “Walláhi, no
man hath a wife like unto the lady my wife for high caste and
continence!” Now he was ever singing her praises in every
assembly; but one day of the days as he was sitting in a séance of
the great, who all were saying their says anent womankind and
feminine deeds and misdeeds, the man rose up and exclaimed,
“Amongst women there is none like my wife, for that she is pure
of blood and behaviour;” hereat one of those present said to
him, “Thou liest, O certain person!”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying

and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that while the man
was singing the praises of his spouse one of those present rose
and said to him, “Walláhi, thou liest, O certain person!”
“Wherein do I lie?” quoth he, and quoth the other, “I will teach
thee and show thee manifestly whether thy wife be a lady or a
whore. Do thou rise up from amongst us and hie thee home and
go thou in to her and say:—O Woman, I am intent upon travelling
to a certain place and being absent for a matter of four days and
after will return; so do thou arise, O Woman, and bring me some
bread and a mould of cheese by way of viaticum. Then go thou
forth from beside her and disappear for a while; and presently
returning home hide thee in a private place without uttering a
word.” Cried those present, “By Allah, indeed these words may
not be blamed.” Accordingly, the man went forth from them
and fared till he entered his house where he said, “O Woman,
bring me something of provision for a journey: my design is to
travel and to be absent for a space of four days or haply six.”
Cried the wife, “O my lord, Thou art about to desolate me nor
can I on any wise bear parting from thee; and if thou needs must
journey do thou take me with thee.” Now when the man heard
these the words of his wife he said to himself, “By Allah, there cannot
be the fellow of my spouse amongst the sum of womankind,”
presently adding to her, “I shall be away from four to six days
but do thou keep watch and ward upon thyself and open not my
door to anyone at all.” Quoth she, “O Man, how canst thou quit
me?<a id="r399"></a><a href="#f399" class="c012"><sup>[399]</sup></a> and indeed I cannot suffer such separation.” Quoth he, “I
shall not long be separated from thee;” and so saying he fared
<span class="pageno" id="Page_291">291</span>forth from her and disappeared for the space of an hour, after
which he returned home softly walking and hid himself in a place
where none could see him. Now after the space of two hours
behold, a Costermonger<a id="r400"></a><a href="#f400" class="c012"><sup>[400]</sup></a> came into the house and she met him
and salam’d to him and said, “What hast thou brought for me?”
“Two lengths of sugar-cane,” said he, and said she, “Set them
down in a corner of the room.” Then he asked her, “Whither
is thy husband gone?” and she answered, “On a journey: may
Allah never bring him back nor write his name among the
saved and our Lord deliver me from him as soon as possible!”
After this she embraced him and he embraced her and she kissed
him and he kissed her and enjoyed her favours till such time as he
had his will of her; after which he went his ways. When an hour
had passed a Poulterer<a id="r401"></a><a href="#f401" class="c012"><sup>[401]</sup></a> came to the house, whereupon she arose
and salam’d to him and said, “What hast thou brought me?”
He answered, “A pair of pigeon-poults;” so she cried, “Place
them under yon vessel.<a id="r402"></a><a href="#f402" class="c012"><sup>[402]</sup></a>” Then the man went up to the woman
and he embraced her and she embraced him and he tumbled<a id="r403"></a><a href="#f403" class="c012"><sup>[403]</sup></a> her
and she tumbled him; after which he had his will of her and
presently he went off about his own business. When two hours or
so had gone by there came to her another man which was a
Gardener;<a id="r404"></a><a href="#f404" class="c012"><sup>[404]</sup></a> so she arose and met him with a meeting still fairer
<span class="pageno" id="Page_292">292</span>than the first two and asked him, “What hast thou brought with
thee?” “A somewhat of pomegranates,” answered he; so she
took them from him and led him to a secret place where she left
him and changed her dress and adorned herself and perfumed
herself and Kohl’d<a id="r405"></a><a href="#f405" class="c012"><sup>[405]</sup></a> her eyes. After that she returned to the
pomegranate-man and fell a-toying with him and he toyed with
her and she hugged him and he hugged her and at last he rogered
and had his wicked will of her and went his ways. Hereupon the
woman doffed her sumptuous dress and garbed herself in her everyday
garment. All this and the husband was looking on through
the chinks of the door behind which he was lurking and listening
to whatso befel, and when all was ended he went forth softly and
waited awhile and anon returned home. Hereupon the wife arose
and her glance falling upon her husband she noted him and accosted
him and salam’d to him and said, “Hast thou not been absent at all?”
Said he, “O Woman, there befel me a tale on the way which may
not be written on any wise, save with foul water upon disks of dung,<a id="r406"></a><a href="#f406" class="c012"><sup>[406]</sup></a>
and indeed I have endured sore toil and travel, and had not Allah
(be He praised and exalted!) saved me therefrom, I had never
returned.” Quoth his wife, “What hath befallen thee?”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent,
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night?” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the wife asked
the husband saying, “What hath befallen thee on thy way?”
And he answered, “O Woman, when I went forth the town and
took the road, behold, a basilisk issued from his den and coming
to the highway stretched himself therealong, so I was unable to
step a single footstep; and indeed, O Woman, his length was that
of yon sugar cane, brought by the Costermonger and which thou
placedst in the corner. Also he had hair upon his head like
the feathers of the pigeon-poults presented to thee by the
Poulterer-man, and which thou hast set under the vessel; and
lastly, O Woman, his head was like the pomegranates which thou
tookest from the Market Gardener<a id="r407"></a><a href="#f407" class="c012"><sup>[407]</sup></a> and carriedst within the house.”
Whenas the wife heard these words, she lost command of herself
and her right senses went wrong and she became purblind and
deaf, neither seeing nor hearing, because she was certified that her
spouse had sighted and eye-witnessed what she had wrought of
waywardness and frowardness. Then the man continued to her,
“O Whore! O Fornicatress, O Adulteress. How durst thou say to
me, ’There is not amongst womankind my better in nobility
and purity?’ and this day I have beheld with my own eyes
what thy chastity may be. So do thou take thy belongings
<span class="pageno" id="Page_294">294</span>and go forth from me and be off with thyself to thine own
folk.” And so saying he divorced her with the triple divorce and
thrust her forth the house. Now when the Emir heard the afore-told
tale from his neighbour, he rejoiced therein; this being was a
notable wile of the guiles of womankind which they are wont to
work with man for “Verily great is their craft.”<a id="r408"></a><a href="#f408" class="c012"><sup>[408]</sup></a> And presently
he dismissed the fourth lover, his neighbour, even as he had freed
the other three, and never again did such trouble befal him and

  <h2 class="c006">CŒLEBS THE DROLL AND HIS WIFE AND HER FOUR LOVERS.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_297">297</span>There lived at the Court of a certain King a man wherewith he
was wont to jest and this droll was unmated. So one day of the
days the Sultan said to him, “O Man, thou art a bachelor, so
suffer us to marry thee,” and said the buffoon, “No, O King of
the Age; allow me to remain in single blessedness, for in womankind
there is no rest and they work many a wile, and indeed I fear
lest haply we fall upon one who shall be of the fornicatresses, the
adulteresses.” Quoth the King, “There is no help but that thou
wed;” and quoth the Droll, “’Tis well, O King of the Age.”
Hereupon the Sultan sent to summon the Wazir and bade him
betroth the man to a woman of righteous conduct and come of
decent folk. Now the Minister had with him an old nurse, and he
commanded her to find a match for the Sultan’s Jester; whereupon
she rose and went out from him and engaged for the man a
beautiful woman. And presently the marriage-tie was tied between
these twain and he went in unto the bride and she tarried with him
a while of time even half a year or may be seven months. Now
one day of the days the King’s Jester went forth his house ere the
dawn-prayer had been called on some business for the Sultan,
intending to return before rise of sun. Such was the case with
him; but as regards his wife, she had known when yet unmarried
four men who to her were the liefest of her companions and who,
during the earlier days of her wedding, had not been able to
possess her. However, on the morning when her husband fared
forth from her before the call to dawn-prayers, each and every of
these four favoured lovers made up their minds to visit their playmate.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_298">298</span>Now one of them was a Pieman<a id="r410"></a><a href="#f410" class="c012"><sup>[410]</sup></a> and the second was an
Herbalist,<a id="r411"></a><a href="#f411" class="c012"><sup>[411]</sup></a> the third was a Flesher and the fourth was the Shaykh
of the Pipers.<a id="r412"></a><a href="#f412" class="c012"><sup>[412]</sup></a> When the Droll went forth from his wife behold,
the Pieman came and rapped at the door, whereat she opened to
him and said, “Thou hast come betimes,” and said he, “I have
minced the meat and I desired to work it up when I found that
the hour was too early and that no one was in the market. So I
said to myself:—Up with thee and go to Such-and-such a woman.”
“’Tis well,” quoth she; but when they desired to make merry
together, of a sudden the door was knocked; so quoth he to her,
“Who is this?” and quoth she to him, “I know not, but do thou
hie and hide thee in yonder closet.” He did her bidding, whereupon
she went forth and threw open the door when behold, it was
the Herbalist and she said to him, “This is a time betimes.” Said
he, “By Allah, I was nighting in the garden and I have brought
these sweet-scented herbs, and as the hour was over-early I said to
myself:—Go thou to Such-and-such a woman and make merry,
thou and she, for a wee.” So she let him in; but hardly had he
settled himself in his seat when suddenly the door was again
rapped and he asked her, “Who is this?” and she answered, “I
know not, but do thou hie and hide thee in yonder closet.” So he
went in and found the Pieman there seated and said to him,
“What thing mayest thou be?”<a id="r413"></a><a href="#f413" class="c012"><sup>[413]</sup></a> and said the other, “I and thou
are each like other.” Meanwhile the woman had gone forth and
opened the door when behold, she was met by the Flesher whom
<span class="pageno" id="Page_299">299</span>she led within and then said to him, “This is a time betimes.”
Quoth he, “By Allah, I arose from sleep and slaughtered a ram<a id="r414"></a><a href="#f414" class="c012"><sup>[414]</sup></a>
and prepared the flesh for selling when I found that the hour was
over-early and said I to myself:—Take thee a piece of mutton-flesh
and go thou in to a certain person and enjoy yourselves, thou
and she, until the Bazar shall have opened.” But hardly had he
taken seat when came a fourth knock at the door, and as he heard
this he was wonderstruck; so she said to him, “Fear not, but hie
thee and hide thee within yonder closet.” Accordingly he went
in and found the Pieman and the Herbalist there sitting and he
salam’d to the twain who returned his salute; then he asked them,
“What hath brought you hither?” and they answered, “That
which brought us brought also thee.” He took seat with them
while the woman went and threw open the door and behold, she
was met by her friend the Shaykh of the Pipers belonging to the
Sultan, so she brought him in and said to him, “Indeed thy time
is betimes.” Said he, “Walláhi, I went forth my home intending
to fare and prepare the band<a id="r415"></a><a href="#f415" class="c012"><sup>[415]</sup></a> in the Royal Palace when I found
the hour was over-early, so said I to myself:—Hie thee to a certain
person and make ye merry, thou and she, until the sun shall rise
and thou art bound to wend palacewards.” “’Tis well,” quoth
she and seated him and designed to take seat beside him when
behold, came a rap at the door and he cried, “Who is that?” and
she replied, “Allah only is Omniscient, but haply ’tis my husband.”
So he was startled and afeard, and when she whispered to him,
“Up and enter yon closet,” he did her bidding and found
a-facing him therein the Pieman and the Herbalist and the Flesher
to whom he said, “Peace be upon you,” and when they returned
his greeting he asked them, “Ye, who brought you?” They
<span class="pageno" id="Page_300">300</span>answered him saying, “That which brought us also brought thee.”
After this he sat beside them and the four remained seated in the
closet and huddled together, whilst each addressed himself saying,
“What now wilt thou do?” Meanwhile the woman suddenly
went forth and opened the door when behold, it was her mate the
Droll who walked in and took seat; whereupon she asked him
“And thou, why hast thou come at such hour? ’tis not often thy
wont to return early from the King’s presence. Haply thou art
unwell, for thy custom is not to appear until near supper-tide and
now thou hast forestalled our meeting-time and hast returned
a-morn. I suspect that he hath bespoken thee concerning some
matter of urgent matters that thou comest home at this hour; but
haply thou wilt finish off such business and hie thee back to the
Sultan.” Quoth he, “By Allah, O Woman, when I fared forth
hence and went to the King I found that he had many and
important affairs to settle, so he said:—Hie thee to thy home and
abide therein, nor return to me till after the third day.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent, and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director, the
right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming
and worthy celebrating, that when the King’s Jester went in
<span class="pageno" id="Page_301">301</span>to his wife she said, “Thou, wherefore hast thou come so early?”
and said he, “By Allah, the Sultan hath much and important
business and said to me:—Hie thee home, and tarry there and
return not to me save after the third day.” Now when the four
men who were closeted together heard these words they were perplext
as to their affair, and said one to other, “What shall we
do? Indeed we are unable to sit out three days in this stead.”
Hereupon the Pieman said to them, “Nay, rather let us play a
prank whereby we may escape,” and said they, “What may be
the device thou wouldest devise?” Quoth he, “Whatso I do that do
ye look upon and then act in like guise,” and so speaking he arose
and taking his minced meat fell to sticking it upon his skin until
he was like a leper covered with sores.<a id="r416"></a><a href="#f416" class="c012"><sup>[416]</sup></a> Then he went forth the
closet to the husband of his mistress, and cried, “The Peace be
upon you!” The man returned his salute and asked him, “What
art thou?” to which he made answer, “I am the Prophet Job the
Ulcered, where is the way out of this?” “Here,” cried the Jester,
upon which Job passed out of the door and went about his business
and on such wise made his escape. Next the Herbalist stood up and
opening his basket brought out fragrant herbs and fell to scattering
them over his sconce and about it and over his ears,<a id="r417"></a><a href="#f417" class="c012"><sup>[417]</sup></a> till such
time as all his face was hidden in greens, after which he also went
out and accosting the house-master said, “The Peace be upon you!”
And when the man returned the salam he asked him, “Hath Job
the Ulcered passed by thee on this path?” “Indeed he hath,” said
the other; “but what mayst thou be?” “I am Al-Khizr, the
Green Prophet” (upon whom be The Peace),<a id="r418"></a><a href="#f418" class="c012"><sup>[418]</sup></a> and so saying he
brushed by the Droll and passed through the door. Now when the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_302">302</span>second lover had gone forth and escaped, the Flesher arose and
donning the ram’s skin set its horns upon his head and began
crawling out of the closet upon all fours, hands and knees, until he
stood before the husband of his beloved, and said to him, “The
Peace be upon you!” “And upon you be The Peace,” returned
the other, “What mayst thou be?” “I am Iskandar, Lord of the
Two Horns,” cried the other; “say me, have there passed by thee
Job the Ulcered and Al-Khizr the Green Prophet (upon whom be
The Peace)?” Quoth the house-master, “They went by this place
and forewent thee.” So the third lover passed through the doorway
and escaped, and presently the Shaykh of the Pipers rose to
his feet and applying the mouthpiece of his pipe to his lips went
up to his mistress’s mate and said, “The Peace be upon you!” and
on the man returning his salam, asked him, “Hath it so happened
that Job the Ulcered and Al-Khizr the Green Prophet and Iskandar
Lord of the Two Horns passed this way?” “They have,” answered
the other, “What art thou?” Cried he, “I am Isráfíl,<a id="r419"></a><a href="#f419" class="c012"><sup>[419]</sup></a> and ’tis
my design forthright to blow the Last Trump.” Hereupon the Droll
straightway arose and laid hands upon him crying, “Yállah,
Yállah,<a id="r420"></a><a href="#f420" class="c012"><sup>[420]</sup></a> O my brother, blow not at all until we shall have gone, I and
thou, to the Sultan.” So saying he took him by the hand and
fared forth with him and ceased not faring until he had carried him
into the presence, when the King asked, “Wherefore hast thou
arrested this man?” Answered he, “O King of the Age, this is
our Lord Israfil and ’twas his intent to blow the Last Trump, so I
forbade him therefrom until such time as I had brought him for
thee to look upon, lest haply he might so have done without thy
knowledge, and said I to myself:—By Allah, better set him before
the Sultan ere he sound his Trumpet. Furthermore I do pray for
<span class="pageno" id="Page_303">303</span>thy welfare, O King of the Age, inasmuch as thou hast married me
to this dame because I had fear of her lest she company with strange
men. But I found her a saintly woman who admitted none of mankind
save that to-day when I went forth from thee at morning-tide
I turned me homewards and going into my house caught with
her three Prophets and one Archangel and this is he who intended
to blow the Last Trump.” Hereupon quoth the Sultan to him, “O
Man, art thou Jinn-mad? How canst thou have found with thy
spouse any of the Prophets as thou sayest?” And quoth he, “By
Allah, O King of the Age, whatso hath befallen me that I have
reported to thee nor have I hidden from thee aught.” The King
asked, “Which was he of the Prophets thou foundest beside thy
wife?” and he answered, “The Prophet Job (on whom be The
Peace) and after him came forth to me from a closet the Prophet
Al-Khizr (on whom be The Peace!), and after him Iskandar Lord of
the Two Horns (on whom be The Peace!) and lastly this the fourth
is the Archangel Israfil.” The Sultan marvelled at his words, and
exclaimed “Laud to the Lord! Verily this man whom thou
entitlest Israfil is naught but the Shaykh of my Pipers.” “I wist
naught, O King of the Age,” said the other, “but I have related to
thee what hath occurred and what I beheld and eyewitnessed.”
Hereupon the Sultan understood that the wife had friends who
forgathered with her, and who had served her husband with such
sleight, so he said to the musician, “O man, unless thou tell me
truly what happened I will cut off thy head.” Thereupon the
Shaykh of the Pipers arose, and kissing ground before the
Sultan, said to him, “O King of the Age, give me promise of
immunity and I will relate to thee all that befel.” Quoth the
King, “’Tis upon condition that thou tell no lies;” and quoth the
other, “O King of the Age, verily, I will shun leasing.”<a id="r421"></a><a href="#f421" class="c012"><sup>[421]</sup></a> So
the King gave him a pledge of safety, and the Shaykh described
<span class="pageno" id="Page_304">304</span>everything that had been done and kept nothing back, and when
the King heard the story and the trick which had been wrought
by the woman’s friends he marvelled thereat and cried, “Allah
kill all womankind,<a id="r422"></a><a href="#f422" class="c012"><sup>[422]</sup></a> the fornicatresses, the adulteresses, the
traitresses!” After which he despatched a posse of the Chamberlains
to bring into his presence the four persons.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
despatched a posse of his Chamberlains to bring into his presence
the four persons who were lovers to the Droll’s wife, and he found
the first to be a Pieman who had claimed the rank of our lord Job
(on whom be The Peace!) and the second to be a Market-Gardener
<span class="pageno" id="Page_305">305</span>who sold savoury herbs and all manner fragrant growths, and he
had made himself out to be Al-Khizr (on whom be The Peace!),

Iskandar, Lord of the Two Horns (on whom be The Peace!);
whilst the fourth, whom the Jester had brought, and who declared
that he was the Archangel Israfil, and was about to blow the Last
Trump, proved to be the Shaykh of the Pipers. Now when the
four were before the King he gave orders to castrate them all save

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_309">309</span>It is related that in Misr of Káhir there was a man who had
reached the age of fourscore and ten years, and he was a chief-Watchman
of the ward in the service of the Wáli; a brave man
withal, and one not wont to be startled or afeard. Now one night
as he was going around about the city with the Chief of Police,
and he was returning to the guard-house<a id="r425"></a><a href="#f425" class="c012"><sup>[425]</sup></a> before break o’ day that
he might perform the Wuzú-ablution, and at the call to dawn-prayers
he might rise and repeat them, it so fortuned that when he
was about to stand up to his orisons, according to the custom of
him, suddenly a purse fell before him upon the ground. As soon
as he had done with his devotions he arose and gazed around to
see who had thrown him that bag of money, but he could find
nobody; so he took it up and opened it, when an hundred dinars
met his sight. Hereat he wondered; but on the following day
when he had washed and was praying, behold, a second purse was
cast at his feet; so he waited until he had finished his orisons and
then stood up and looked around to see who had thrown it.
Thereupon, as he failed to find any, he took it up and opened it
and again beheld an hundred dinars, a matter which filled him
with wonder. This continued till the third day at morning-tide,
when he had washed as was his wont and stood up to his prayers,
and lo and behold! another purse was dropped at his feet. Herewith
<span class="pageno" id="Page_310">310</span>he cut short his devotions, and turning him round saw beside
him a girl whose years had reached fifteen; so he seized her and
said, “Who art thou, and what is the reason of thy throwing at
my feet every day a purse of an hundred gold pieces, and this is
the third time; argal the sum amounteth to three hundred. What
may be this case?” Said she, “O my lord, my name is Fátimah,
and my wish and will is a matter which thou canst bring to an end
for me by means of thy tongue!” Quoth he, “What is’t thou
wantest of me?” and quoth she, “’Tis my intent that on the
morrow I sham drunkenness with wine and cast myself before the
mansion of the Kazi of the Army.<a id="r426"></a><a href="#f426" class="c012"><sup>[426]</sup></a> Thou shalt find me there
strown upon the ground and dressed in all the best of my clothes

and espy me lying there in drink do thou bid the Linkman move
the links to and fro; then come forward, O Mukaddam,<a id="r427"></a><a href="#f427" class="c012"><sup>[427]</sup></a> and
investigate the case and examine me, and say the Wali:—This
girl is in liquor. The Chief of Police shall reply to thee:—Take
her and carry her to the watch-house and keep her there till daybreak.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day,
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
<span class="pageno" id="Page_311">311</span>love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth
the girl to the Mukaddam, “And when thou shalt have found me
drunken with wine, the Wali shall bid thee:—Take her to the
watch-house and there keep her till daybreak. Hereto do thou
object:—No! this were not suitable: I will cry upon someone
of the quarter and will awake the Kazi of the Army, for that she
belongeth to his ward. Then assemble all thy folk and say to
them:—Verily this girl is in liquor and not mistress of herself at
such time; needs must she be of a great family and daughter to
grandees; therefore ’twere not proper that we take her with us to
the watch-house; nor let any hold her in his charge save the Kazi
of the Army till morning and until such time as she shall have
recovered her senses and can fare to her own folk.” Hereupon
quoth the Mukaddam to her, “Easy enough!” and quoth she,
“An thou act on this wise and my success be from thy hand, I
will give thee five hundred dinars besides the three hundred.”
“This matter is not far to us,”<a id="r428"></a><a href="#f428" class="c012"><sup>[428]</sup></a> said he; so she left him and went
away. Now when it was the season after night-prayers, the Chief
of Police came forth his quarters and, repairing to the watch-house
and taking the Mukaddam and his men, would have
threaded the highways of Cairo as was his wont, but the head
Gate-Keeper forewent him and took the direction of the quarter
wherein dwelt the Kazi of the Army; the Wali unknowing the
while what was in the man’s thought. They ceased not faring
until they entered that part of the town wherein stood the Judge’s
house, and when they approached it, lo and behold! the Mukaddam
found a something strown upon the ground. So said he to the
Linkman who carried the light, “O my son, do thou shake the
torch,” and when he moved the link to and fro it illumined the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_312">312</span>whole quarter. Then the Gate-Keeper came forward; and, looking
at what was lying there, found it to be a damsel in liquor dressed
out with sumptuous dress and adorned with all her ornaments: so
he said to the Wali, “O my Chief,<a id="r429"></a><a href="#f429" class="c012"><sup>[429]</sup></a> this girl is drunken with wine
and hath fallen on the ground;” and said the Chief of Police,
“Take her up and carry her to the watch-house until morning.”
Hereupon quoth the Mukaddam, “No! this were not fitting; nor
is it possible for the like of this girl. She is in the ward of the
Kazi al-’Askar, to whose household haply she belongeth or to
some great man in the quarter, and we fear lest befal her of evil
matters some matter and we shall come to be transgressors.”
Hereupon, after applying some remedy to the damsel, they made
her sit up and presently they called aloud upon the people of the
quarter and awoke the Judge and when all the folk came out
in a body the Wali said to them, “Look ye upon this girl; peradventure
you may know whose daughter she is.” They came
forward and examined her and found her garbed in sumptuous
garments and trickt out with the whole of her ornaments, whereupon
the Chief of Police and the Mukaddam of the Watchmen
said to them, “Indeed ’tis not possible for us to remove yon
maiden from this place; so do you take her to your homes until
morning-tide when she shall recover and be able to care for herself
and then fare to her own folk.” Hereat they made agreement that
none should lodge her in his house save the Kazi of the Army;
so a party of the servants raised her and led her to his mansion
and set her in a chamber hard by the open saloon; after which
each and every of them fared forth to sleep in his own place. On
this wise it befel the Wali and the Mukaddam and the Kazi and
the folk of the ward; but as regards the affair of the damsel whom
they found stretched on the ground as one drunken, she on
entering the Kazi’s abode pulled herself together and recovered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_313">313</span>herself, for that she had wrought all this wily work for the special
purpose of being led into the house there to carry out her wish
and will. Presently the Judge lay down and was drowned in
slumber and knew not what Allah had destined to him from the
plans and projects of the girl who, rising up at midnight, opened
the door of her chamber leading into the saloon where the Kazi
al-’Askar kept all his hoards and coin<a id="r430"></a><a href="#f430" class="c012"><sup>[430]</sup></a> and dresses and belongings.
Now she had appointed her people to meet her at that house, so
they came and carried off the whole of what was in the saloon
nor did they leave aught therein, at all, at all, save only the
matting. And when dawned the morn, the Kazi of the Army
arose and repaired to the saloon, as was his wont, for the purpose of
dressing but he found therein nothing except the matting. So he
buffeted his face with his palms and wailed aloud whereat a party
of his servants came to him and asked, “What is the matter with
thee, O our lord the Kazi?” then, on going into the saloon they
remarked that it had been gutted of everything. So they went
from him and threw open the door of the chamber wherein they
had placed the damsel but they found her nowhere.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and
that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
<span class="pageno" id="Page_314">314</span>the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Kazi’s
folk went and threw open the door of the chamber wherein the
damsel had slept; and, when they found nothing therein, they
were certified it was she who had carried away the good. After
such fashion it happened to these; but as regards the action of the
Judge, he took horse and wended his way to the Sultan, and he
ceased not wending till he had entered the presence and salam’d
and blessed the Sovran who returned his salute. Then cried he,
“O King of the Age, there hath befallen me that which is so-and-so,
and I have a claim on the Chief of Police and the Mukaddam
of the watch, for that indeed they were the men who bade me
admit the girl into my home, and this guest of mine hath left me
nor muchel nor little.” Hereupon the King bade summon the
men with their many, and when they came before him, he bade
strike off the heads of the two head men; but they said to him,
“O King of the Age, grant us three days’ respite and, if aught
discover itself to us and we rid ourselves of the responsibility, we
shall be saved; but an we avail not thereto, the sword of the
Sultan is long.” “Go forth,” cried the King; “I have granted
you a three days’ delay; if you bring the offender ’tis well, and if
not, your heads shall be in lieu thereof and eke so your families
and your properties.” Hearing this they sued for dismissal, and
the Wali went forth to search in this way and wander in one
direction and the Mukaddam in another. They roamed about
Cairo for two full-told days, but naught happened to them until
the third about the call to noontide-prayers, when the Mukaddam
entered a narrow street on the side of the city to the west, and
behold, a door opened and a speaker spake saying, “O Mukaddam,
who is behind the door?” So he turned towards the sound and
said, “’Tis well,” and the other cried, “Come thou and draw near
<span class="pageno" id="Page_315">315</span>to me.” He did so and approached the entrance when suddenly he
saw the damsel who had shammed drunkenness<a id="r431"></a><a href="#f431" class="c012"><sup>[431]</sup></a> and whom they
had introduced into the Kazi al-’Askar’s house. Now when he
accosted her and recognised her, he seized her and she asked him,
“Wherefore dost thou arrest me and what is thine intent to do
with me?” “We will carry thee to the Sultan,” answered he, “and I
and the Wali shall be set free. During the last three days I have
done nothing but wander about in search of thee who hast wrought
for us such work and after hast fled from us.” Quoth the girl, “O
clever one, had I designed the ruin of you I had never made
myself manifest to thee, nor couldst thou have met me or
forgathered with me: however, I will now work at freeing you
from the hands of the Sultan, that both thou and the Wali may
escape and that you twain may take from the Judge of the Army
whatever of good you want and will.” Quoth he, “How shall we
do?” and quoth she, “I have by me a white slave-girl the very
likeness of myself and at this time I have dressed her in my dresses
and decorations and have cut her throat, and by my cleverness and
force of heart I have caused her be carried to a ruin hard by the
Kazi’s house and have had her buried therein and have set over
her a slab.” So do thou fare hence and taking the Wali seek the
Sultan and say him:—“We have wandered about Misr, the whole
thereof, but we have found naught of our want, and now nothing
remaineth to us save the house of the Kazi al-’Askar; so we desire
to search therein and, if we find that damsel murthered, we will
gather together the folk of the quarter who saw us before that they
may look upon her; and be the Judge also standing by that we
may ask the people:—What say ye concerning this maiden? when
haply they may reply, This is the girl which was drunken with
wine. And as soon as they shall bear witness that it is the same,
you twain shall stay behind to converse with the Judge as ye desire
<span class="pageno" id="Page_316">316</span>and take from him whatever you wish and will; and he shall sue
you for grace and for aidance. Then will he go up to the King and
report to him saying:—I have found my debtor and I have recovered
from him all my good; whereupon you shall be set free and eke
I shall be freed. And finally do ye come hither to me and we
will divide all the plunder I have taken from the Kazi’s house.”
Now when the damsel had made the old Watchman understand
these words, he left her, and going to the Wali, informed him of
the whole affair and reported all that the girl had communicated
to him of treachery and plottings, whereupon the Chief of Police
took horse, and accompanied by the Mukaddam, rode to the
Palace,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Wali
rode to the Palace, he and the chief Watchman, seeking the
Sultan, and they ceased not riding until they entered the presence
and saluted the Sovran, praying for the endurance of his glory
and the continuance of his life-tide. He returned their salute and
asked concerning the affair of his Judge and they answered him,
“O King of the Age, verily we have wandered about Misr and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_317">317</span>the entirety thereof, without finding any and now there remaineth
for our search naught save the quarters occupied by the Kazi al-’Askar.
So we design to examine it that if aught be found therein
we may be set free, and if not that thou work upon us thine own
intent.” Hereupon the Sultan sent to summon the Judge; and,
when he made act of presence, commanded him suffer the Wali
and the Mukaddam to search his quarters and he replied,
“Hearing and obeying.” The whole forty then fared from the
Palace and reaching the Judge’s mansion rummaged it until they
came upon the ruined stead described by the damsel; so thither
they went and seeing a slab newly laid, pulled it up and found
beneath it a white girl full-dressed and ornamented.<a id="r432"></a><a href="#f432" class="c012"><sup>[432]</sup></a> The Watchman
fared forth and summoned all the ward-folk who considered
narrowly the corpse of the murthered damsel, and they all cried
with a single voice, “Indeed this be the girl which was drunken
with wine and which was carried into the Kazi’s quarters.” And
they bore official testimony to such effect what while the Judge,
who was standing in that stead looking and listening, said to
himself, “How can such case have occurred to us without cause?”
And when this business was finished, the Wali turned to the Kazi
and said “O Shaykh of Islam,<a id="r433"></a><a href="#f433" class="c012"><sup>[433]</sup></a> we left this damsel in thy charge
and to thine honour until morning-tide, deeming that haply she
might be the daughter of a grandee house and yet hast thou cut
her throat and hidden her within thy premises.” But the Judge
could return to him no reply nor attempt any address, for he
feared lest the King should hear thereof; so he inclined to the
Master of Police and got ready for him an hundred purses and
twenty for the Mukaddam that they might keep silence and not
report such matter of scandal to the Sultan. Accordingly they
accepted that amount of money from him and the Kazi went forth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_318">318</span>from him and took horse and informed the Sultan that he had
found his debtor and had recovered his due; but he spoke not
these words save for fear of the Chief of Police and the Head of
the Watchmen lest they inform the King that they had found the
murthered damsel within his demesne. Then the Mukaddam
repaired to the house where the She-thief had bespoken him and
standing at the door knocked thereat when those inside asked,
“Who mayest thou be?” and he answered, “I am seeking
Fatimah!” “Who is Fatimah?” cried they, “we have here nor
Fatimah nor Halímah.”<a id="r434"></a><a href="#f434" class="c012"><sup>[434]</sup></a> Thereupon quoth the Mukaddam,
“Indeed this Fornicatress, this Adulteress hath wrought upon us
and hath escaped us; but, seeing that we also have won free by
virtue of the wile she pointed out to us, we will leave her to time
and doubtless during the length of days we twain shall forgather
again.” On this wise endeth the story (quoth Shahrazad); but I
will now relate a very different adventure and ’tis the</p>

</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_321">321</span>It fortuned once upon a time that two men went forth from the
same place, one foregoing the other, and they forgathered by the
way. Now each had a bag full of flour and a flask<a id="r436"></a><a href="#f436" class="c012"><sup>[436]</sup></a> containing somewhat
of water; and when they made acquaintance on the road the
first of them said to his companion, “O my brother, what may be thy
name?” and said the Second, “I am hight Mohsin, the Beneficent,<a id="r437"></a><a href="#f437" class="c012"><sup>[437]</sup></a>
and thou what art thou called?” Quoth the other, “Músà the
Malignant.”<a id="r438"></a><a href="#f438" class="c012"><sup>[438]</sup></a> So the two fared on in converse and whenever mealtime
came round, each would bring out a portion of meal and knead
it and make of it a scone,<a id="r439"></a><a href="#f439" class="c012"><sup>[439]</sup></a> and light a fire and bake it thereon:
after which they would satisfy their hunger. But Mohsin knew not
that had been doomed for him by his companion Musa the Misdoer,
so the twain would fare together and feed together. On
the following day quoth Musa to Mohsin, “O my brother, I have
with me a bag of flour and a flask of water and thou hast the same,
and whenever eating-time cometh round each one bringeth out
somewhat of his vivers. Now this is not right; ’twere the better
<span class="pageno" id="Page_322">322</span>way that we first eat that is with thee and when ’tis ended we use
my provaunt.” “’Tis well, O my brother,” quoth Mohsin. They
agreed upon this condition and whenever moved by appetite they
ate of Mohsin’s viaticum until his bag of flour and his flask of
water were clean emptied. But when the meal-hour came, Musa
arose and made for him a single scone and no more, and baked
it and ate it by himself, while Mohsin sat-by looking on. This
befel time after time for the first day and the second day until
Mohsin waxed anhungered and famine wrung his vitals, so quoth
he to Musa, “O my brother, give me somewhat of thy food that
I may nourish myself therewith, for indeed I am empty exceedingly.”
But Musa made reply, “By Allah, I will not give it to
thee; no, not a single mouthful.” Rejoined Mohsin, “O my
brother, we two made covenant that we should become brethren,
and first eat of my provaunt and then of thine; now, however,
thou art not pleased to grant me or bite or sup. This is not
the act of an honest man.” He answered, “Be brief! an thou be
hungry I will give thee half of my scone on condition that I
pluck out thine eye.” “How so, O my brother?” rejoined
Mohsin, “Wilt thou blind me of one eye for the sake of half
a scone? better leave me to die with my sight as it is.” Said
Musa, “At thy pleasure!”<a id="r440"></a><a href="#f440" class="c012"><sup>[440]</sup></a> But on the third day Mohsin was
like to sink for extreme hunger, and he cried, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great. Do thou, O Musa, give the half-scone and pluck out one
of mine eyes.” Musa did as he was bidden, and thrusting forth
his finger gouged<a id="r441"></a><a href="#f441" class="c012"><sup>[441]</sup></a> out the right eye, whereby Mohsin remained
<span class="pageno" id="Page_323">323</span>purblind, withal was he not filled by the half-scone. Now on the
fourth day Mohsin waxed yet more ravenous and famine was
right sore upon him, and he cried, “There is no Majesty! by
Allah, O Musa, my brother, I am a-famished, so pity me and the
Lord shall pity thee.” Replied the other, “I will give thee
nothing until I shall have gouged out thine other eye.” Quoth
Mohsin, “Verily we are Allah’s and unto him we shall return!
but, by the Almighty, famishing is bitter; so do thou with me,
O Musa, what the Omniscient hath predestined as to the plucking
out of my two eyes.” Accordingly the man gave him the half
scone and plucked out his other eye; and on such wise made
him stone blind. Hereupon Musa left his companion darkly
tramping<a id="r442"></a><a href="#f442" class="c012"><sup>[442]</sup></a> about the roads. Now in the neighbourhood of that
place was a well full of water;<a id="r443"></a><a href="#f443" class="c012"><sup>[443]</sup></a> so when Mohsin drew near
knowing nothing thereof, Musa came up and pushed him thereinto;
and while falling into the pit Mohsin said to himself, “O
Lord, thou hast doomed me to blinding and at last Thou hast
condemned me to drowning.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when Musa
had thrust Mohsin into the well with intent to drown him, the
blinded man cried, “O Lord thou hast doomed me to blinding, and
at last Thou hast condemned me to drowning.” Then he struck
out with hands and feet till he felt the walls of the well wherein
he found two niches; so he set toes into one of them and there
stood awaiting the salvation of Allah which was nearhand; and
his heart was satisfied and he drank of the water. When the first
night fell behold, two of the Jinns came to the pit and sat down in
converse each with other, when quoth the first to the second,
“Walláhi! O certain person, there is now to be found nor sage
nor leach, and all of them are preposterous pretenders and balkers
of man’s intent.” Quoth the other, “What may be these words?”
and the former resumed, “By Allah, I have possessed the daughter
of the Sultan and she is the dearling of my heart whom I love
with dearest love; yet can none avail to unsorcel her of me.”
Quoth his companion, “And what would expel thee?” And quoth
he, “Naught will oust me save a black cock or a sable chicken;
and whenas one shall bring such and cut his throat under her feet
of a Saturday,<a id="r444"></a><a href="#f444" class="c012"><sup>[444]</sup></a> I shall not have power to approach the city wherein
she dwelleth.” “By Allah, O my brother,” said the other, “thou
hast spoken sooth: there is in this land nor wizard nor mediciner
who knoweth aught, and all of them are liars and contradictors
who lay claim to science without aught of intelligence; indeed
<span class="pageno" id="Page_325">325</span>there is not one of them who knoweth of this tree (which adjoineth
our well) that whoso shall take the leaves thereof and plaster them
upon his eyes, even though he be born blind he will be gifted with
sight and wax sound after two or three days by the kind permission
of Allah Almighty. Yet are the folk all heedless of such virtue in
the tree.” Now Mohsin remained listening to these words and
pondering them as he stood supported by the side-wall of the well,
and when it was the last third of the night, the Jinns which were
conversing at the mouth took leave each of other. And as soon as
the day brake and the time waxed bright behold there came a Kafilah
which passed by the pit seeking drink for themselves and water for
their cattle. Presently they let down a bucket by a cord and when
Mohsin felt the rope he caught hold thereof, whereat the caravan
people cried, “We take refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned,”
and said one to other, “Verily in this well is a Satan!” Mohsin
heard their words and answered them and said, “Yá’llah<a id="r445"></a><a href="#f445" class="c012"><sup>[445]</sup></a> Ho
you, draw me out hence, for verily I am of mankind and not of
Jinn-kind and being blind I fell yesterday into this hole.” Cried
they, “Catch tight hold of the cord,” and when he did so they
drew him out and finding him weak from famine they gave him
a somewhat of food and he ate and drank. The caravan-folk on
like guise drank from the well and watered their beasts; after
which they would have led Mohsin away with them but he said,
“O my brethren (whose weal Allah increase<a id="r446"></a><a href="#f446" class="c012"><sup>[446]</sup></a> and whose grace
may He reward!), I have a single want wherewith I fain ye would
favour me!” Asked they, “And what may that be?” and he
answered, “That ye direct me to the tree which adjoineth this well
and lead me close thereto and God shall gar your good to grow!”
Hereupon one hent him by the hand and after doing as he desired
and setting him beside the tree returned to his own folk and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_326">326</span>caravan loaded and left the place. Presently Mohsin swarmed up
the trunk; and, taking seat upon a branch of its branches, fell to
cropping the leaves and patching them upon either eye as he had
heard the Jinni prescribe; and hardly had two days gone by when
he felt healed of his hurt and opened his eyelids and saw what
was around him. Then, after taking somewhat of its foliage, he
came down from the tree and went on his wayfare until he entered
a city and found him a lodging. When this was done he fell to
threading the streets and ways crying aloud the while, “I am
the Leach, the Healer!<a id="r447"></a><a href="#f447" class="c012"><sup>[447]</sup></a> I am the Mediciner who can cure the
blind!” whereat all the one-eyed and the sightless would summon
him with outcries and he would apply to them somewhat of his
leaves; and after two or three days (he superintending the while)
they would open their eyes and see. On this wise went by a term
of time until at last the King of that city heard rumour of a new
leach; so he sent to him and summoned him and said to him,
“Art thou a clever Medicine-man even as they have informed me
concerning thee? I have a daughter ridden<a id="r448"></a><a href="#f448" class="c012"><sup>[448]</sup></a> by a Jinni of the
Jánn and we desire of thee that thou unsorcel her.” “And if I
avail not to free her?” asked Mohsin, and the King answered,
“Then will I kill thee even as I have slain a many before thee
who have looked upon the face of the Princess.” “And if I prove
able to deliver her and fend her from further offence?” “I will
give thee what thou askest of coin and hoards.” “No, O King of
the Age; this condition I will not accept: if I free her I must
take her to wife, for an I fail therein thou wilt slay me; and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_327">327</span>unless thou agree with me after I shall have saved her that thou
e’en wed her to me.”——<a id="r449"></a><a href="#f449" class="c012"><sup>[449]</sup></a> “’Tis well, O Shaykh; and for releasing
her I give thee a delay of three months for visiting and
healing her.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
covenanted with the Mediciner that the unsorcelling of the Princess
should be within three months; after which he set apart an apartment
for him with all the furniture and appurtenances thereof and
appointed to him rations of meat and drink. So Mohsin abode
with him the appointed time and he in the extreme of comfort
and enjoyment; but when the three months were ended the Sultan
sent for him and summoned him between his hands and said, “O
Shaykh, the term is gone-by.” Hereupon Shaykh Mohsin went
<span class="pageno" id="Page_328">328</span>forth and bought him a black cock and when Sabbath<a id="r450"></a><a href="#f450" class="c012"><sup>[450]</sup></a> came round
the Sultan presented him to his daughter whom he found in sore
and sorrowful state, unknowing aught concerning herself or how
the mishap had occurred to her. Now when he went in and
looked upon her in such case, he drew near to her and fell to
reciting Koranic versets which avert evil (the Sultan sitting beside
them the while); and at the last he slaughtered the cock between
her feet. Hereat the Princess recovered her senses and rose up
and sat down<a id="r451"></a><a href="#f451" class="c012"><sup>[451]</sup></a> forthright and called for meat and drink which were
brought to her; then she ate and drank and besought for herself
the guidance of God and said, “Alhamdolillah”—laud to the
Lord—and presently she kissed the hand of her sire and of
Shaykh Mohsin. Quoth the King, “O my daughter, art thou
indeed well?” and quoth she, “At this present I feel naught of
pain in my person nor do I sense anything of what hath been
with me; and all this is by blessing of yonder Shaykh thou hast
brought to me. But say me, O my father, what hast thou made
over to him of money as a reward for unsorcelling me?” “O my
daughter,” replied he, “I have offered him all he shall ask.” But
when the Princess recovered from her malady and returned to self,
she changed from mode to mode and she became as one cast in
the mould of beauty and loveliness and Shaykh Mohsin looking
upon her was dazed and amazed in his wits by cause of her
exceeding comeliness and seemlihead. Presently the Princess
addressed him, “O Shaykh Mohsin, what thing dost thou ask of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_329">329</span>the King’s Majesty?” for indeed her heart was fulfilled of the love
to him which had mastered her. Now the Wazir had a son and it
was his aim that his heir should marry the King’s daughter, but
this his wish was in vain; for when she was certified that her salvation
was at the hand of Shaykh Mohsin, she said to her sire, “Do
thou, O my father, largesse what is dearest to thee upon my
healer.”<a id="r452"></a><a href="#f452" class="c012"><sup>[452]</sup></a> Her design in these words was that the Sultan might
bestow her to wife upon her deliverer, and she added, “Indeed our
joyance hath been at his hands and he is deserving of munificence
full and abundant.” But again the object of her speech was that
her parent might espouse her to the Shaykh for the love to Mohsin
which had mastered her heart. Quoth her father, “O my daughter
we will give him a sumptuous robe of honour and ten purses;”
but quoth she, “No, O my sire, this be not gift sufficient for the
like of such service.” Now she was the sole prop of her parents
who had no child save herself, so the King replied, “O my
daughter, I will give him whatso thou shalt say.” Thereupon she
asked him, “How many of the folk came in to me and uncovered
my shame<a id="r453"></a><a href="#f453" class="c012"><sup>[453]</sup></a> and were slain therefor?” and he answered, “Some
fifty.” Then cried she, “Had not Shaykh Mohsin been able to
exorcise me what hadst thou done with him?” “Indeed I had
slain him.” “Then Alhamdolillah—Glory be to God—for that my
deliverance was at his hand: so do thou bestow upon him thy
best,” and so she spake for that she was ashamed to say her sire,
“Wed me to him.” The King not understanding the hint she
had hinted said to her, “All thou wishest I will largesse to him;”
and she, “I have spoken to thee but thou hast not comprehended
my words! All who have looked upon my shame and proved
unable to deliver me thou wast wont to slay and this man hath
been my salvation after seeing me unveiled: how then wilt thou
gift him with money and means or condition with him when thou
<span class="pageno" id="Page_330">330</span>art unable to carry out thy compact?” Hereupon the King
became ware of what was in his daughter’s mind and forthwith
sending to summon the Kazi and witnesses he bade bind the
marriage-bond between her and Shaykh Mohsin and in due time
let them lead him to her in procession and suffer him go in unto
her. So he cohabited with the Princess a while of time, after
which the life-term of the Sultan drew near, and he fell sick of a
sickness whereof he died. And when they had committed his
remains to earth the Lords of the land and the Grandees of command
forgathered and agreed in council that none should overrule
them save the Shaykh Mohsin. So they invested him with the
signet-ring of Sovranty and seated him upon the throne of
Kingship and he became Sovereign and Sultan. Moreover Allah
Almighty enlightened his heart in governance with justice and
equity; and all the subjects with the Notables of the realm and
the Rulers of high rank blessed him and prayed for him. Now
one day of the days Sultan Mohsin felt desirous of solacing
himself in the gardens; so he rode forth, he and his suite, when
he suddenly sighted his whilome comrade, the same who had
plucked out one eye for half a scone and had gouged out the other
eye for the other half. He bade them bring the man to the
presence and when they set him between his hands he asked him
saying, “O Shaykh, what may be thy name?” and he answered,
“I am hight Shaykh Mohammed.” So he carried him with his
suite to the gardens where they abode until day ended, after which
the Sultan rode back and entering his palace, bade bring Shaykh
Mohammed whom he despatched to the House of Hospitality.<a id="r454"></a><a href="#f454" class="c012"><sup>[454]</sup></a>
On the third day he bade summon his guest after supper-tide
and taking him by the hand led him into a cabinet and said, “O
Shaykh Mohammed, do thou tell us a tale.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
<span class="pageno" id="Page_331">331</span>to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with
that I would relate to you on the coming night an the King
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
King entered the closet leading Mohammed by the hand he said
to him, “Do thou, O Shaykh, tell us a tale.” “By Allah, O our
lord,” quoth the other, “I know naught of stories.” Whereupon
the Sultan rejoined, “If so it be, I will relate to thee, O Shaykh
Mohammed, an adventure of my own and ’tis as follows:—Once
upon a time a man went forth his town and he made companionship
with another upon the way, and each one of them bore with
him a bag of meal and a flask of water.” On this wise the Sultan
continued recounting to him the real history of Mohsin and Musa
the Malignant, till at the end of the tale he said, “And Musa, after
gouging out both eyes of Mohsin for the sake of a single scone
thrust him into a well designing to drown him therein, but Allah
Almighty preserved his life and brought him forth the pit and our
Lord favoured him and restored to him his two eyes and empowered
him over the kingdom and thus did he become Sovran
and Sultan. Now the prosperity of that Shaykh Mohsin was from
the well whereinto Musa had thrust him.” Presently he added, “An
this tale be soothfast, then am I Mohsin and thou art Musa the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_332">332</span>Malignant. I am able at this moment to slay thee but I will spare
thee and moreover counsel thee as follows:—Do thou go to the
well and haply Almighty Allah shall thereby grant to thee some
good, for that the root of my fair fortune was from that same
pit.” Now when the first third of the night had sped, Musa arose
and repaired to the pit and descended therein when behold, the
same two Jinnis had forgathered beside the well-mouth at that
same hour and were seated together conversing each with other.
Quoth the first, “What is thy case this day?” and quoth the
second, “By Allah, O my brother, my condition is ill-conditioned
ever since a certain night when we met in this place and talked
together. And so it hath continued until the present time, for that
I have been unable to approach the city wherein dwelleth the
Sultan’s daughter: and someone that was in the well must have
overheard us whilst we knew naught of him and he must have
acted according to our words and slaughtered the black cock;
after which I have been unable to near her abode.” Quoth the
other, “By Allah, O my brother, thou has spoken sooth; but our
ill-constraint is from this well.” Hereupon the Jinni put forth his
hand about the pit<a id="r455"></a><a href="#f455" class="c012"><sup>[455]</sup></a> and finding Musa the Misdoer snatched him
up and seizing him between his palms tore his body into four
pieces and cast away the quarters in some desert stead. And
this (said Shahrazad) is the award of whoso betrayeth his fellow
man. And they also relate the adventure of</p>

  <h2 class="c006">MOHAMMED THE SHALABI AND HIS MISTRESS AND HIS WIFE.<a id="r456"></a><a href="#f456" class="c012"><sup>[456]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_335">335</span>It is told among the many things which happened in Cairo the
God-guarded that therein dwelt a man who was an Emir and who
had a son Mohammed Shalabi<a id="r457"></a><a href="#f457" class="c012"><sup>[457]</sup></a> hight, a youth in his day unique
for beauty and loveliness, nor in his time was there his peer for
comeliness and seemlihead amongst women or amongst men.
Now when he had attained the age of ten and was approaching
puberty, his sire betrothed him and wedded him to a fair wife who
loved him with fondest love even after marriage. There was also
in Misr a Kazi al-’Askar, a Judge of the Army, who had a
daughter singular for form and favour and bloom and brilliancy,
and stature and symmetric grace and she was known as Sitt
al-Husn—the Lady of Loveliness. Now one chance day of the
days she went forth together with her mother and the handmaidens
to the Baths and when they reached the half way behold,
they were confronted by the young Shalabi whose glance fell upon
the girl and her glance lit upon the youth, wherefrom love and
affection for him settled in her heart and it was with him after the
same fashion. Presently she began to send him messages and
letters and he to do on like guise, yet could neither win possession
of other nor indeed could the twain meet privately in one place.
This endured for the space of three years therefore were their
hearts melted in fire of mutual love-longing, until on a certain day
when desire in the girl surged high for her lover and likewise did
his yearning for his beloved; withal neither availed to win union.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_336">336</span>Hereupon befel them sore travail and trouble and the young lady
sent an old woman to her dearling praying him to meet her in such
a site; and when the go-between had informed him thereof, he
arose to obey her without stay or delay, unknowing what was
hidden from him in the Secret Purpose. He fared till he came to
the place in question when it was the hour of sunset and here the
Shalabi forgathered with the Kazi’s daughter who had kept tryst
with him accompanied by her handmaidens; and anon the twain,
he and she, repaired to a retired spot. Now by the decree of the
Decreer which is written upon the foreheads and the brows of mankind,
one of the folk belonging to the Chief of Police was loitering
about the place when the couple entered that secret stead; and as
soon as they had settled themselves comfortably, each began complaining
to other of the pangs of separation. After this the
handmaidens brought to them food, meat and wine, and they ate
and drank and toyed and were cheered and made merry from set
of sun till the noon o’ night and they conversed together as boon
companions until either was fulfilled of other and the pains of
parting had vanished from their hearts. Such was the case with
the lover and the beloved; but as regards the Wali’s man who was
looking upon them and listening, he well knew the place wherein
the couple had retired and having noted it and certified himself
thereof, he went to the Chief of Police and made his report saying,
“In such a site of such a ward are a man and a maid whereupon
show the signs of affluence, and doubtless an thou seize them thou
shalt easily get from each and either some fifteen purses.” The
Wali hearing these words forthwith led out his party and marched
with them to the spot appointed; and he ceased not wending for
half the night until they all came to the trysting place. Then he
pushed forward axe<a id="r458"></a><a href="#f458" class="c012"><sup>[458]</sup></a> in hand and smote the door and broke it
<span class="pageno" id="Page_337">337</span>down; and forthright he rushed into the room without being
expected by the youth or the young lady whom he found sitting
together in the very height of enjoyment. But when they saw him
suddenly appear they were consterned and confounded and confused
as to their affair, so he arrested them and led them off and carried
them to his house, where he placed them in prison.<a id="r459"></a><a href="#f459" class="c012"><sup>[459]</sup></a> Forthwith
the bruit concerning the youth went abroad and reached his family;
to wit, how Mohammed Shalabi had been seized by the Chief of
Police, together with the girl his beloved. Now after imprisoning
them the Wali said, “This pair shall remain with me for a day
or two days and until I catch them in their robbery;”<a id="r460"></a><a href="#f460" class="c012"><sup>[460]</sup></a> but
quoth one of the party, “Indeed thou knowest not and thou hast
not learnt that this damsel is the daughter of the Kazi of the Army
who throughout the past year wrought for the slaying of thee by
the Sultan.” And hardly had the Wali heard these words than
his heart was filled with joy and he exclaimed, “By Allah, needs
must I have his wench disgraced and proclaimed by bell<a id="r461"></a><a href="#f461" class="c012"><sup>[461]</sup></a> about
the thoroughfares of Cairo and him dishonoured in the presence
of the Sultan and degraded from his degree.” Now when it was
morning-tide a rumour flew about town that the Judge’s daughter
had been seized by the Wali and the watch together with the
young Shalabi in a certain place and presently the report reached
her father who cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! O Saving God, save me!
Oh vile disgrace and foul dishonour before Sultan and subjects
who shall say the Kazi’s daughter hath been seduced and abused.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_338">338</span>However may the Veiler enveil me!” On his part the Wali went
up to the Palace and sought the Sovran to acquaint him therewith;
but, finding that he had business, he sat him down to await its
ending when he purposed informing him concerning the daughter
of his enemy the Chief Kazi. On such wise it befel him; but as
regards the wife of the youth who was lover to the girl, as soon as
the rumour reached her that the Shalabi had been arrested by the
Wali and the watch, she arose to her feet without stay and delay
and doffing whatso of woman’s dress was upon her——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as soon as the
Shalabi’s wife was informed touching her husband how the Wali
had seized him in company with the Kazi’s daughter, she arose
forthright and doffing whatso of woman’s dress was upon her and
donning man’s disguise provided herself with somewhat of provaunt<a id="r462"></a><a href="#f462" class="c012"><sup>[462]</sup></a>
and went forth intending for the gaol in the Wali’s house.
<span class="pageno" id="Page_339">339</span>She asked for the road as she went and a man of the people
directed her to the office until she reached the place carrying her
victuals; then she enquired for the gaoler. So they made him
meet her and quoth she, “Open to me the prison wherein they have
gaoled the Shalabi and the maiden,” and she promised him by signs
a gold piece; hereupon he admitted her and she passed into the
room where lay her spouse and the girl and set meat before him.
But he knew her not and cried, “Indeed I will nor eat nor drink,
and do thou fare from me and leave me in this my plight.” Quoth
she, “Nay, thou must eat and gladness shall befal thee.” Accordingly
he came forward and ate a small matter and she after sitting
with him for an hour or so, arose and doffed her man’s dress. Then
she stripped the Kazi’s daughter of all the clothes she was wearing
and garbed her in the masculine garb wherewith she had entered
to the twain. The young lady did as she was bidden and showed
likest to the Shalabi’s wife who lastly served her with what
remained of the meat and said to her, “Up with thee and hie thee
home.” So the Kazi’s daughter fared forth under the disguise of
a dainty youth such an one as he who anon had entered the gaol;
and as soon as she had wended her way the wife took seat beside
her husband. When he saw her habited in the habit of the Kazi’s
daughter he recognised her and knew her for his spouse; so he
asked of her, “What hath brought thee hither?” and she answered,
“I have come with this contrivance for the purpose of saving thee
and of saving the honour of the girl thou lovest.” But as soon as
the Kazi’s daughter had departed in her disguise the gaoler was
deaf to entreaty and closed the prison doors upon the pair and
the Shalabi and his spouse sat down together and his heart was
satisfied and his secret was safe-directed,<a id="r463"></a><a href="#f463" class="c012"><sup>[463]</sup></a> and fell from him all
the sorrow which had settled upon his heart. Such was the case
<span class="pageno" id="Page_340">340</span>with these two; but as regards the Chief of Police, when he went
up to the Sultan and saw that he was busied he took patience
until the work was ended, after which he came forward and kissed
ground before him and salam’d to him and blessed him. The
King returned his salute and then said, “What is to do?” and
said he, “O King of the Age, I found during the past night the
Lady Sitt al-Husn, daughter to the Kazi al-’Askar, companying
with her lover a certain Mohammed Shalabi son of the Emir
Such-and-such; so I seized the couple and confined them by me
and now I myself come to report the case in thy presence.” When
the Sultan heard these words, he was wroth with exceeding wrath
and his eyes flashed red and his outer jugulars<a id="r464"></a><a href="#f464" class="c012"><sup>[464]</sup></a> swelled and he
foamed at the mouth and roaring cried, “How can it be that the
daughter of the Kazi al-Islam companieth with a lover and
alloweth herself to be debauched? By Allah, needs must I slay
her and slay her father and slay the youth her lover.” Thus befel
it with the Sultan and the Wali; but as regards the matter of the
girl Sitt al-Husn, when she went forth the prison in the dress of a
Shalabi, a dainty youth, she ceased not wending till she reached
her paternal home. Here she repaired to a place which was
private and having doffed her man’s dress garbed her in maidenly
garments, then retiring secretly to her own room lay her down
and her heart was heartened and trouble and turmoil and travail
of mind fell from her. Now at that time her mother was lamenting
<span class="pageno" id="Page_341">341</span>like a funeral mourner and buffeting her face and her breast
and kept crying out, “Oh the shame of us! Oh the dishonour of
us! When they shall have informed the Sultan of this, he
shall surely slay her sire.” And the Kazi waxed distraught
and full of thought and he also said in his mind, “How shall I
remain Kazi al-Islam when the folk of Cairo say:—Verily the
daughter of our Lord High Chancellor hath been debauched?”
With these words he kept visiting his wife’s apartment and sitting
with her for awhile, then faring forth and coming in from place to
place<a id="r465"></a><a href="#f465" class="c012"><sup>[465]</sup></a> and he wandered about like one bewildered of wits. When
behold, a handmaid of the handmaidens entered the room wherein
lay the Kazi’s daughter and finding her strown upon her bed
looked upon her and recognised her. So she left her and running
in her haste hied her to the mistress and cried, “O my lady, indeed
Sitt al-Husn of whom you are talking is lying down in such a
room of the Harem.” Thereupon the mother arose and went
and came upon her daughter, so she rejoiced in her and returning
to the Kazi in his apartment acquainted him therewith. He also
repaired to his daughter’s bower and finding her therein quoth he,
“Where hast thou been?” Quoth she, “O my father, my head
began to ache after sunset-time, so I lay me down in this place.”
Hereupon without stay or delay the Kazi took horse, he and his
Officials, and repaired to the Sultan——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister, Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and goodwill! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Kazi of
the Army repaired to the Sultan, he and the whole of his officials,
and he ceased not wending until he entered the presence, where
he salam’d and said, “O King of the Age, is it lawful and allowed
of Allah Almighty that thy Wali charge us with calumnious charge
and false?” As the Chief of Police was standing hard by, the
Sultan asked him, “How can the Wali have misspoken thee and
thy daughter when she is still imprisoned by him and in his
house?” whereto the Chief of Police added, “’Tis true! his daughter
is surely with us in durance vile, she along with her lover, for
indeed I found the pair in such a place.” Said the Kazi, “O
King of the Age, I will abide here beside thee and do thou let
the Wali go down and bring before thee that which is with him in
gaol, and the case shall be made manifest, because hearing with
the ear is not like eyeing with the eye.” The Sultan replied,
“This rede is right,” whereupon the Chief of Police returned to
his house and ordered the gaoler to open the gaol and bring
thereout the maiden Sitt al-Husn and her lover the youth
Mohammed Shalabi. The man did his bidding and leading
forth of prison the couple committed them to the Chief of Police
who took them and fared with them to the Sovran, rejoicing the
while with all joy. The citizens of Cairo heard of all this, so they
flocked in crowds to solace them with the spectacle; and when
the Wali reached the presence, the maiden and the young man
being with him, he set them before the Sultan. Presently the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_343">343</span>King asked the youth saying, “Who mayest thou be, O young
man, and who is thy father?” and answered he, “I am son of
such an Emir;” when the King who believed that she was the
daughter of the Chief Kazi continued, “And this maiden that is
with thee, who may she be and whose daughter?” The youth
replied, “This is my wife, O King of the Age,” and the King
rejoined, “How can she be thy wife?” So the youth retorted,
“Indeed she is; and Such-an-one and So-and-so and Such-another
together with a host of thy favoured courtiers wot right well that
she is my spouse and that she is the daughter of So-and-so.”
Hereupon they accosted her and bespoke her and she bespake
them, so they recognized her and were certified that she was
lawful wife to the Shalabi. Then asked the King, “How is it
that the Wali arrested thee and her?” and the youth answered,
“O King of the Age, I went out with this my wife intending to
enjoy ourselves and, finding a place that was cheerful and pleasant
we tarried there until midnight when the Wali broke in upon us
and seized us, scandalously declaring that I was companying with
the Kazi’s daughter. Then he carried us off and gaoled us in his
house and now (Alhamdolillah!) here we are between thy hands.
So do thou whatso thou will and command according to Holy
Law and whoever shall deserve chastisement deal it to him, for
thou art the lord of our necks and the master of our good.” Now
when the youth spake these words the King bade put to death the
Chief of Police and harry his house and enslave his women and
he commanded the Crier before the execution to cry about the
thoroughfares of Cairo in front of the Wali that he was being led
to die and declare, “This is the award of him who dishonoureth
the noble and chargeth the folk with lying charges and false!”
After that they slew the Chief of Police and thus carried out the
King’s commandment.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.

  <h2 class="c006">THE FELLAH AND HIS WICKED WIFE.<a id="r467"></a><a href="#f467" class="c012"><sup>[467]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_347">347</span>There was of olden time in the land of Egypt a Fellah, or tiller
of the ground, who had a fair woman to wife and she had another
man to friend. The husband used to sow every year some fifty
faddán<a id="r468"></a><a href="#f468" class="c012"><sup>[468]</sup></a> of seeding-wheat wherein there was not one barley-grain,
and grind it in the mill and pass this meal to his spouse who
would sift it and bolt it. Then would she take the softest and best
of the flour to make thereof either scones or cakes<a id="r469"></a><a href="#f469" class="c012"><sup>[469]</sup></a> or something
more toothsome which she would give to her friend and feed him
therewith, whereas the refuse of the flour<a id="r470"></a><a href="#f470" class="c012"><sup>[470]</sup></a> she would make into
loaves for her husband so this bread would be ruddy-brown of
hue.<a id="r471"></a><a href="#f471" class="c012"><sup>[471]</sup></a> Now every day about dawn-time the Fellah was wont fare
to his field either to ear or to delve and tarry there working till
noon at which time the wife would send him the bread of bran
and refuse flour, whilst to those beside him who wrought as he did,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_348">348</span>would be brought from their homes white bread and clean. So
they said, “Ho certain person! thy wheat is from fine sowing-seed,
nor is there in it a barley-corn, how then be your bread like
unto barley?” Quoth he, “I know not.” He remained in such
case for a while of time whilst his wife fed her playmate with all
the good food and served to her husband the vilest of diet, until
one chance day of the days the Fellah took his plough and went
off at early dawn to work and wrought till midday when his wife
sent him his dinner of dirty bread. Hereupon he and his neighbours,
who were earing in the same field, took seat and each one
set before him white bread and seeing the Fellah’s scones brown as
barley-meal they marvelled thereat. They had with them a scald-head
boy who was sitting with them at the noon-meal, so they said
to the peasant, “Take thee to servant this youngster and he shall
manifest thee the case wherein thou art from the doings of thy
dame.” He obeyed their bidding——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Fellah
obeyed their bidding and took with him the scald-head youngster
for house-service and on the second day the lad fell to grinding
<span class="pageno" id="Page_349">349</span>at the mill and carried the meal to his mistress and sat beside
her and anon she rose and sifted and bolted the flour; still he stayed
by her stealthily watching her while she kneaded it and balled it and
breaded it. After this he carried off the early meal for his master
and faring to the field set it before him and when the Fellah
looked upon it he cried, “O Boy, by Allah this bread is white and
’tis clean unlike the foregone.” Quoth he, “O my master, I have
ground it with my own hands and I sat beside my mistress the
while she got it ready, kneading it and baking it, wherefor she
availed not to do aught else with it.” Now when the servant-lad
had left the hut her lover came in asking, “Hast thou made bread
for me?” and she answered, “Indeed the boy with the scald-head
ceased not sitting beside me, nor was I able to bake aught for
thee.” But when the lad had gone forth to the field with his
master’s dinner he set it before him and returned in hot haste and
hurry to the house, where he found the friend of his mistress conversing
with her; so he hid himself behind the door and fell to
overhearing them and to noting whatso they said. Amongst other
things quoth she, “Take this quartern of good wheat and clean
grain and grind it in this mill and I will make thee a platter of
bread from handrubbed flour<a id="r472"></a><a href="#f472" class="c012"><sup>[472]</sup></a> which I will send to thee on the
morrow.” Asked he, “How shalt thou know the field?” and she
answered, “Carry with thee a basket of bran and drop the contents
as thou walkest along the highway; then leave it hard by the
land belonging to thee and I will follow the traces and find thee
a-field; and so do thou remain at rest.” All this and the scald-head
boy was standing behind the door hearkening to their words
until he had understood them all. On the next day the lad took
a basket of bran which he scattered on the way to his master’s
<span class="pageno" id="Page_350">350</span>land and then sat with him whilst the wife, after baking the platter
full of scones, carried it upon her head and fared forth intending
for her lover in the field. She marked the traces of the bran
which the scald-head had dropped and she ceased not following
them until she came to her husband’s field. Hereupon the lad
arose and taking the platter from her said, “By Allah, O my
master, verily my mistress loveth thee and favoureth thee, for that
she hath brought a bannock made from handrubbed grain; and
so saying he set it before him.” Presently she looked out of the
corner of her eye and saw her lover ploughing at a little distance
from them; so she said to her husband, “Allah upon thee, O
certain person, call aloud to so-and-so our neighbour that he may
come and eat the noon-meal with thee.” The man said, “’Tis
well;” and presently added, “O Boy, go forth and shout to such-an-one.”
Now the lad had brought with him a parcel of green
dates, so he arose and scattered them at intervals upon the highway;
and when he came to his mistress’s lover he cried aloud, “Do
thou come dine with my master.” But the man refused so to do
wherefore the scald-head returned and said, “He will not;” and
hereupon the wife bade her husband go himself and fetch him.
The Fellah trudged along the highway and finding thereon the
scattered dates bowed himself downwards to gather them when the
lover said to himself, “This one is picking up stones wherewith to
beat me;”<a id="r473"></a><a href="#f473" class="c012"><sup>[473]</sup></a> and as he saw the man often stoop he fled and left the
place, and the more the other cried to him, “Come hither, O
certain person,” the faster sped he in his running.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting, and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the more that
man cried to the lover “Come,” the faster did he run away; so
the Fellah returned and said, “He misliketh to come and he hath
fled.” Hereupon he took seat together with the scald-head and
the neighbours to dine off the scones of handrubbed grain, and
the wife served to them whatso she had made for her lover’s eating
and she would not touch aught thereof but left it for her spouse
and for his servant and for the neighbours. On the following day
the Fellah went forth betimes to plough whilst the boy, delaying
purposely at home, hid himself behind the door when behold, the
lover entered to her, and she said, “’Tis my desire that we forge a
story whereby to slay my husband and Master Scald-head the
servant.” Quoth he, “How wilt thou slay them?” and quoth
she, “I will buy for them poison and make it up in cooked food, so
they may devour it together and perish together; after which we
will abide, I and thou, making merry, nor shall the dead disturb
us any more.” He rejoined, “Do what thou willest,” and all this
whilst the boy stood listening to them behind the door. But as
soon as the lover went forth the house, the lad arose and retired;
then, donning Jews’ garb he shouldered a pair of saddle-bags and
went about crying, “Ho! Aloes good for use. Ho! Pepper<a id="r474"></a><a href="#f474" class="c012"><sup>[474]</sup></a> good
<span class="pageno" id="Page_352">352</span>for use. Ho! Kohl good for use. Ho! Tutty good for use!”
Now when the woman saw him she came forth the house and
hailed him, “Ho thou the Jew!” and said he to her, “Yes, O my
lady.” Then said she, “Hast thou with thee aught of poison?”
and said he, “How, O my lady? Have I not with me poison of
the hour?<a id="r475"></a><a href="#f475" class="c012"><sup>[475]</sup></a> and whoever shall eat thereof in a mess of sweet milk<a id="r476"></a><a href="#f476" class="c012"><sup>[476]</sup></a>
and rice and clarified butter shall die within that time.” “Do
thou take this dinar,” continued she, “and give me somewhat of
it;” but he rejoined, “I do not trade for moneys, and I will sell it
only for ornaments of precious metal.” Hereupon she pulled off
one of her anklets and handed it to him and he, who had provided
himself with half a loaf of Egyptian sugar,<a id="r477"></a><a href="#f477" class="c012"><sup>[477]</sup></a> gave her the moiety
thereof, saying, “Use it with sweet milk and rice and clarified
butter.” She took it in high glee, and arising milked the she-buffalo,
after which she boiled the loaf-sugar in the milk and then
threw it into a sufficiency of the rice and the clarified butter,
fancying the while that she was cooking a mortal meal,<a id="r478"></a><a href="#f478" class="c012"><sup>[478]</sup></a> and lastly
she ladled out the mess into a large platter. Now when it was
sunset-time her husband returned from the field and was met about
half-way by the boy who told him all that he had overheard and
how he had sold her the sugar for one of her anklets, saying,
“This be poison.” Then he charged him that, as soon as both of
them should have swallowed the mess of milk and rice and clarified
butter, they fall down and feign dead. So master and servant
<span class="pageno" id="Page_353">353</span>agreed upon this plan. And when the Fellah entered the hut she
served to them the platter which contained their supper, and they
ate the whole thereof, she sitting by intent upon their action and
expecting their death. But they served her with a sleight; for
suddenly the Fellah changed countenance and made as though he
waxed ill and faint, and fell upon the ground like one in the last
agony, and shortly after the boy rolled upon the floor on similar
wise. Whenas she considered them she exclaimed, “May Allah
have no mercy upon you; the wretches are dead!” Hereupon
she went out and called aloud to her lover, and as he was coming
cried, “Hie thee hither and enjoy the sight of these dead ones;”
so he hastened up to them, and seeing them stretched upon the
floor said, “They’re dead.” Presently quoth she, “We two, I and
thou, will now make merry;” and so saying she withdrew with
him into another hut, intending at once to sleep together. Hereupon
the husband arose and went in to them and smote the lover
with a quarter-staff upon the neck and broke in his back bone,<a id="r479"></a><a href="#f479" class="c012"><sup>[479]</sup></a>
after which he turned to the wicked woman his wife and struck
her and split open her head, and left the twain stone dead. And
as soon as it was midnight he wrapped them in a single sheet and
carried them forth outside the village, and after choosing a place,<a id="r480"></a><a href="#f480" class="c012"><sup>[480]</sup></a>
dug a hole and thrust them therein. And ever after that same
Fellah had rest from his wife, and he bound himself by a strong
<span class="pageno" id="Page_354">354</span>oath not to interwed with womankind—never no more.<a id="r481"></a><a href="#f481" class="c012"><sup>[481]</sup></a> And

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_357">357</span>There was a man in Cairo and he had a wife who ever boasted of
her gentle blood and her obedience and her docility and her fear of
the Lord. Now she happened to have in the house a pair of fatted
ganders<a id="r483"></a><a href="#f483" class="c012"><sup>[483]</sup></a> and she also had a lover whom she kept in the background.
Presently the man came to visit her and seeing beside
her the plump birds felt his appetite sharpened by them, so he said
to her, “O Such-an-one, needs must thou let cook these two geese
with the best of stuffing so that we may make merry over them,
for that my mind is bent upon eating goose-flesh.” Quoth she,
“’Tis right easy; and by thy life, O So-and-so, I will slaughter
them and stuff them and thou shalt take them and carry them
home with thee and eat them, nor shall this pimp my husband
taste of them or even smell them.” “How wilt thou do?” asked
he, and she answered, “I will serve him a sleight shall enter into
his brains and then give them to thee, for none is dear to me as
thyself, O thou light of mine eyes; whereas this pander my mate
shall not touch a bittock thereof.” Upon this agreement the lover
went from her and when her husband returned at sunset-tide she
said to him, “Ho Man, how canst thou ever call thyself a man
when thou never invitest anybody to thy house and no day of the
days thou sayest me:—I have a guest coming to us; even as
another would do; and folk surely will talk of thee and declare
<span class="pageno" id="Page_358">358</span>thou art a miser and unknowing the ways of generosity.” “O
Woman,” said he, “this were for me an easy business and
to-morrow morning (Inshallah!) I will buy for thee flesh and rice
and thou shalt let cook for us or dinner or supper, whereto I will
invite one of my intimates.” Quoth she to him, “Nay, O Man;
rather do thou buy for me a pound of mince-meat; then slaughter
the two geese and I will stuff them and fry them, for that nothing
is more savoury to set before guests.” Said he, “Upon my head
and mine eye be it!” and as soon as it was dawn he slaughtered
the geese and went forth and bought a Rotolo of meat which he
minced and took all was required of rice and hot spices and what not
else. These he carried home to his wife and said to her, “Do thou
finish off thy cooking before midday when I will bring my guests,”
and presently he fared forth from her. Then she arose and cleaned
out the geese and stuffed them with minced meat and a portion of
rice and almonds and raisins;<a id="r484"></a><a href="#f484" class="c012"><sup>[484]</sup></a> and fried them until they were well
cooked; after which she sent for her lover and as soon as he came
she and he made merry together, and she gave him the geese which
he took up and left her.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.

Then she asked, “And hast thou brought only one man?<a id="r485"></a><a href="#f485" class="c012"><sup>[485]</sup></a> hie thee
forth and fetch at least two or better still three.” “’Tis well,” said
he and went off to do her bidding. Then the woman accosted
the guest who came first and cried, “Oh the pity of it! By Allah
thou art lost and the Lá Haul of Allah<a id="r486"></a><a href="#f486" class="c012"><sup>[486]</sup></a> is upon thee and doubtless
thou hast no children.” Now when the man heard these words he
exclaimed, “Why, O Woman?” for indeed fear and affright had
sunk deep into his heart. She rejoined, “Verily my husband hath
not brought thee hither save with the intention of cutting off thy
precious stones the honours of thy yard<a id="r487"></a><a href="#f487" class="c012"><sup>[487]</sup></a> and of gelding thee to a
Castrato; and heigho and alas for thee whether thou die or
whether thou live, and Oh the pity of it for thee!” Now when
the man heard this speech, he arose in haste and hurry and rushed
out by the door when behold, the husband came bringing with him
two of his familiars. So the wife met him at the entrance and
said to him, “O Man, O miserablest of men, O thou disappointed,
O thou dissatisfied,<a id="r488"></a><a href="#f488" class="c012"><sup>[488]</sup></a> thou hast brought to me a fellow which
<span class="pageno" id="Page_360">360</span>was a thief, a ne’er-do-well like unto thyself.” “How so?” asked
he, and she answered, “The man stole the two geese and stole
away.” Thereupon the husband went out and catching sight of the
guest running off shouted to him, “Come back! Come back! even
although thou bring only one with thee and take the other.” Cried
the man in reply, “An thou catch me do thou take thee the two.”
But the house-master meant the two geese whilst the man who was
running away thought only of himself, saying in his mind, “This
one speaketh of my ballocks, meaning that he will take only one
of my stones<a id="r489"></a><a href="#f489" class="c012"><sup>[489]</sup></a> and leave me the other.” So he ceased not running
and the other followed after him, but being unable to catch him
he returned to his guests and served them with somewhat of bread
and so forth, whilst the woman kept blaming him and knagging
about the matter of the geese which she said had been carried off,
but which had been given by her to her lover. The husband enjoined
her to silence; however she would not hold her peace<a id="r490"></a><a href="#f490" class="c012"><sup>[490]</sup></a> and
on this wise he was balked of the meal to feed his wife’s friend.
And now (quoth Shahrazad) I will relate to you somewhat of the
wiles of an honest woman, and thereupon she fell to recounting
the adventure of</p>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_361">361</span>
  <h2 class="c006">THE KAZI SCHOOLED BY HIS WIFE.</h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_363">363</span>It is related of a man which was a Kazi that he had a wife of the
virtuous and the righteous and of the charitable and the pitiful to
the orphan and the pauper; and the same was beautiful exceedingly.
Her husband held and was certified anent womankind that all and
every were like unto his spouse; so that when any male masculant
came into his court<a id="r491"></a><a href="#f491" class="c012"><sup>[491]</sup></a> complaining about his rib he would deliver
his decision that the man was a wrongdoer and that the woman
was wronged. On such wise he did because he saw that his wife
was the pink of perfection and he opined that the whole of her sex
resembled her, and he knew naught of the wickedness and debauchery
of the genus and their sorcery and their contrariety and the
cunning contrivance wherewith they work upon men’s wits. He
abode all careless of such matters, in consequence of the virtues of
his spouse, until one chance day of the days when suddenly a man
came to him with a grievance about his better half and showed
how he had been evil entreated by her and how her misconduct
was manifest and public. But when the man laid his case before
the Kazi and enlarged upon his charge, the Judge determined that
he was in tort and that his wife was in the right; so the complainant
went forth the court as one deaf and blind who could
neither hear nor see. Moreover he was perplexed as to his affair,
unknowing what he should do in the matter of his helpmate and
wherefore the Kazi had determined contrary to justice that he had
<span class="pageno" id="Page_364">364</span>ill-used his spouse. Now as to the Kazi’s wife none could forgather
with her;<a id="r492"></a><a href="#f492" class="c012"><sup>[492]</sup></a> so the plaintiff was distraught and confounded
when he was met unexpectedly on the way by one who asked him,
“What may be thy case, O certain person, and how hath it befallen
thee with the Kazi in the matter of thy rib?” “He hath given
sentence,” quoth the man, “that I am the wrong-doer and that
she is the wronged, and I know not how I shall act.” Whereupon
quoth the other, “Return and take thy station hard by the entrance
to the Judge’s Harem and place thyself under the protection of its
inmates.” The man did as his friend advised him and knocked,
when a handmaiden came out and he said to her, “O Damsel, ’tis
my desire that thou send me hither thy lady, so I may bespeak her
with a single word.” She went in and informed her mistress<a id="r493"></a><a href="#f493" class="c012"><sup>[493]</sup></a> who
rose and humoured him, and standing veiled behind the door
asked, “What is to do with thee, O man?” “O my lady,” said
he, “I place myself under thy ward and thine honour, so thou
enable me to get justice of my wife and overcome her and prevail
over her, for in very deed she hath wronged me and disgraced me.
I came to complain of her ill-conduct before His Honour our lord
the Kazi, yet he hath determined that I am the wrong-doer and
have injured her while she is the wronged. I know not what I
shall do with him, and sundry of the folk have informed me that
thou art of the beneficent; so I require that thou charge for me
the Judge to deliver according to Holy Law his decree between
me and my mate.” Quoth she, “Go thou and take thy rest, nor
do thou return to him until he shall have sent after thee, and fear
not aught from him at all.” “Allah increase thy weal, O my
lady,” quoth he, and he left her and went about his business pondering
his case and saying to himself in mind, “Oh would Heaven
<span class="pageno" id="Page_365">365</span>I wot whether the Kazi’s wife will protect me and deliver me from
this fornicatress, this adulteress, who hath outraged me and carried
away my good and driven me forth from her.” Now when it was
night-tide and the Judge was at leisure from his commandments,
he went into his Harem, and it was his wife’s custom whenever he
returned home to meet him at the middle doorway. But as on
that occasion she failed so to do, he walked into the apartment
wherein she woned and found her at prayers; then he recalled to
mind the contention of the man who had come to him with a
grievance against his spouse——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
tale, O sister mine and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Kazi went in to his wife whom he found praying, he recalled to
mind the matter of the man who had come to him with a contention
against his spouse and he said in his thought, “Verily nor
hurting nor harming ever cometh from womankind and indeed
this liar complaineth of his wife falsely;” for it was still in his
mind that all of the contrary sex are as virtuous as his lady. But
when she had done with her devotions, she rose up to him and
served him and set before him, she and her handmaidens, the tray
<span class="pageno" id="Page_366">366</span>of food and she sat down at meat with him as was her wont. Now
amongst the dishes was a charger containing two chickens, so said
she to her husband, “By Allah, O my lord, do thou buy for us
to-morrow a couple of geese that I may let stuff them, for my
heart is set upon eating of their meat.” Said he, “O my lady,
to-morrow (Inshallah! an it be the will of the Almighty) I will
send to the Bazar and let buy for thee two geese of the biggest
and the fattest and the Eunuchs shall slaughter them and thou
shalt use them as thou will.” Accordingly, at dawn-tide the
Judge sent to buy two plump birds and bade the Eunuchs cut
their throats and the handmaidens gutted them and stuffed them
and cooked them with rice over and above the usual food. Thereupon
the Kazi’s wife arose and proceeded to work her contrivance.
She had bought two sparrows which the hunter had trapped; and
she bade kill and dress them and place them upon the rice instead
of the geese and awaited the even-tide when her husband would
return to supper. Then they spread the tables whereupon was
placed a covered platter under which he supposed stood the geese;
so he took it off and behold, he found the two sparrows. Hereat
he was perplext and said to his wife, “Allaho Akbar—God is
most Great—where be the geese?” and said she to him, “Whatso
thou broughtest here it be<a id="r494"></a><a href="#f494" class="c012"><sup>[494]</sup></a> before thee upon the dish.” “These
be two sparrows,” quoth he, and quoth she, “I wot not.” So the
Judge arose displeased<a id="r495"></a><a href="#f495" class="c012"><sup>[495]</sup></a> with his wife and going to her home
fetched her father and as she saw him coming, she stood up and
whipping off the two small birds placed the big ones in their
stead; and he uncovered the plate and found the geese. So he
said to his son-in-law, “Thou declarest that these be sparrows
but indeed they are geese;” for he also was deceived and went
forth in displeasure with the Judge, after which the Kazi followed
in his footstep and soothed him and invited him to meat but he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_367">367</span>would not return with him. Hereupon the husband padlocked
the door but, before he had entered, the wife had substituted the
birdies for the big birds and when her mate sat down to meat and
would fain have eaten he uncovered the platter and beheld the
two sparrows. Seeing this he was like to go out of his mind and he
cried aloud, “Walláhi! indeed this be a portentous calamity,” and
he went forth, trotting in his haste, until he met his father-in-law
upon the way. Then he cried upon him and said, “Come and
look at the two geese which were in the platter.” “Wherefore?”
asked the other and answered he, “Because I found them changed
to two sparrows.” Hereupon the father returned with him to the
house and walked up to the table whence the lady, during her
husband’s absence, had removed the birdies and replaced the birds
in lieu of them. So the father took off the cover and finding
before him the pair of geese said to his son-in-law, “Be these
two geese? consider them well whether they be sparrows or not.”
“Two geese,” said the other and said the sire, “Then why dost
thou come to me a second and a several time and bring me hither
and complain of my daughter?” Hereupon he left him and went
forth an-angered and the Judge came up with him at the doorway
and soothed him and conjured him to return. Meanwhile the
lady arose and whipping off the geese set the two birdies in lieu
thereof and covered them up; and as soon as the Kazi returned
and sat down to meat he removed the cover from the platter and
found the two sparrows. Hereat he shrieked aloud and arose and
went forth the door and cried, “Ho Moslems, come ye to my
help!”<a id="r496"></a><a href="#f496" class="c012"><sup>[496]</sup></a> Now when the people of the quarter heard the outcry,
they gathered together about the house, when the lady seized the
occasion to carry off the two birdies and to set in lieu of them the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_368">368</span>two geese. Asked they, “What is to do with thee, O our lord the
Kazi, and what hath befallen thee?” and he answered, “I bought
two geese for our supper and now I find them turned into two
sparrows;” and so saying he led the Notables of the quarter into
his house and showed them the dish. They uncovered it and
found therein two geese, so they exclaimed, “These be two geese
which thou callest sparrows;” and so saying they left him and
went their ways. He followed them making excuses and was
absent for a while, when his wife took the birds and set the
birdies in place of them and when the Kazi returned and proceeded
to sit down at meat he uncovered the platter and behold,
thereon stood the two sparrows. So he smote hand upon hand
crying, “These be two sparrows without doubt or hesitation;”
whereat his wife arose and called out with a loud voice, “O ye
Moslems, help ye a Moslemah.”<a id="r497"></a><a href="#f497" class="c012"><sup>[497]</sup></a> So the folk ran to her aidance
and asked her saying, “What is to do, O our lady?” and she
answered, “Verily my calamity is grievous and there is no Majesty
and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great. My
husband the Kazi hath gone Jinn-mad and do you of your grace
and benevolence lay hold of him and carry him to the Máristán.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
<span class="pageno" id="Page_369">369</span>the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Judge’s
wife cried upon the folk of the quarter, “Do ye of your grace and
benevolence to us seize the Kazi and carry him to the Maristan
that they may confine him therein until he return to his reason
and regain his right mind.” Hereupon they laid hands upon him
and bore him to the Bedlam and imprisoned him therein amongst
the maniacs, and it was certified to all the folk that their Kazi had
been suddenly struck by insanity and that they had confined him
in the madhouse. Now all this was of the cunning contrivance of
his wife, that she might make manifest to him concerning womankind
how none of mankind can prevail over them. But after the
lapse of three days which the Judge passed in the Bedlam, his
wife went in to him bringing a somewhat of food and set meat
before him and asked him saying, “What was it thou foundest on
the platter?” Answered he, “Two sparrows,” and continued she,
“Recover thy senses and thy right mind and see here am I who
have made thee out mad for thy confusion between two geese and
two sparrows. Now whenever any man cometh to thee complaining
of his wife (and thou unknowing aught of the couple and of their
circumstances), thou determinest that the male is the evil-doer
and withal thou wottest not that women are often the worst of
wrongers and that men are sorely wronged by them. And in the
matter now in hand, the whole of the folk declare that the Kazi is
a wrong-doer to his wife, and no one knoweth that thou art really
the wronged and I the wronger.” Indeed sooth did he say who
said, “Alas for those who be gaoled wrongfully!” So do thou
never decide aught thou knowest not. However, thou hast approved
to thyself that I am true and loyal to thee and thou makest all
the folk like one to other, but this is a sore injury to some. In the
present case do thou send for the man who is wronged and let
<span class="pageno" id="Page_370">370</span>bring him to thy presence and bid his wife be also present and do
him justice of her.” After this she removed her husband from the
Maristan and went her ways, and the Kazi did with the man as
his lady had charged him do and whenever a plaintiff came before
him with a grievance against his wife he would decide that the
man was the wronged and the woman was the wronger, and he
ceased not doing after this fashion for a while of time. And now
(quoth Shahrazad) I will relate to you another history of
womankind and this is the tale of</p>

  <h2 class="c006">THE MERCHANT’S DAUGHTER AND THE PRINCE OF AL-IRAK<a id="r498"></a><a href="#f498" class="c012"><sup>[498]</sup></a></h2>
</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_373">373</span>Whilome there was, men say, a Khwajah, a merchant man who
was lord of money and means and estates and endowments and
appanages, withal he had no seed, or son or daughter, and therefore
he sued Almighty Allah that he might be blessed with even
a girl-child to inherit his good and keep it together. Suddenly
he heard a Voice bespeak him in dreamery saying, “Ho Such-an-one,
Predestination overcometh Prudence and resignation to
the trials sent by Allah is foremost and fairest.” Hearing this
he arose without stay or delay and casually<a id="r499"></a><a href="#f499" class="c012"><sup>[499]</sup></a> slept with his wife
who, by decree of the Decreer and by allowance of Allah
Almighty, conceived that very night. When she became pregnant
and the signs of gestation showed in her, the merchant
rejoiced and distributed and doled and did alms-deeds; and, as
soon as her tale of days was fulfilled, there befel her what befalleth
womankind of labour-pangs, and parturition came with its madding
pains and the dolours of delivery, after which she brought forth
a girl-babe moulded in mould of beauty and loveliness and showing
promise of brilliance and stature and symmetric grace. Now
on the night after the birth and when it was the middle thereof,
the Merchant was sitting at converse beside his wife and suddenly
he again heard the Voice announcing to him that his daughter was
<span class="pageno" id="Page_374">374</span>fated to become a mother in illicit guise by the son of a King who
reigned in the region Al-Irak. He turned him towards the sound
but could see no man at such time, and presently he reflected that
between his city and the capital of the King’s son in Al-Irak was
a distance of six months and a moiety. Now the night wherein the
Merchant’s wife became a mother was the same when the King’s wife
of Al-Irak bare a boy-heir, and the Merchant, albe he wist naught
thereof, was seized with trembling and terror at the words of the
Voice and said in himself, “How shall my daughter forgather with
the King’s son in question when between us and him is a travel of
six months and a half? What can be such case? But haply this
Voice is of a Satan!” As soon as it was morning-tide the father
summoned astrologers and men who compute horoscopes and scribes
who cast lots,<a id="r500"></a><a href="#f500" class="c012"><sup>[500]</sup></a> and when they presented themselves he informed
them that a daughter had been added to his household and his aim
was to see what the prognostic<a id="r501"></a><a href="#f501" class="c012"><sup>[501]</sup></a> might be. Hereupon all and
every wrought at his art and mystery, and it was shown that the
Merchant’s daughter would become a mother by the son of a King
and this would be in the way of unright: but so far from informing
him of this or suffering him to learn concerning of her circumstance
they said, “The future none wotteth it save Allah Almighty and
our craft at times proveth soothfast and at times falsifieth us.”
However the Khwajah’s heart was on no wise satisfied and he
ceased not to suffer patiently nor did rest repose him nor were meat
and sleep to him sweet for the space of two years, during which his
daughter was suckled and in due time was weaned. The father
never ceased pondering how he should act towards his child and
at sundry times he would say, “Let us slay her and rest from
her,” and at other times he would exclaim, “Let us remove her to a
stead where none shall approach her or of man-kind or of Jinn-kind.”
<span class="pageno" id="Page_375">375</span>Withal did none point out a path to pursue nor did any
guide him to any course of the courses he might adopt. Now one
day of the days he fared forth his house unknowing whither he
should wend and he stinted not wending until he found himself
without the town,——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Khwajah
stinted not wending until he found himself without the town,
where he was expectedly met by a wight in Darwaysh-garb to
whom he salam’d and by whom he was saluted. Presently the
holy man turned to the merchant and seeing him changed of
colour and conduct asked him, “What is with thee to do, and what
ill hast thou to rue that thy case and complexion are so changed
to view?” “O Fakir,” answered the other, “verily a matter of
marvel hath betided me and I know not how to act therein.”
Quoth the ghostly man, “And what may that be?” whereupon
the Merchant related to him all his affair first and last, and how
he had heard a Voice saying to him, “In very deed thy daughter
shall conceive after unlawful fashion by the King’s son of Al-Irak.”
The Darwaysh was surprised on hearing these words
<span class="pageno" id="Page_376">376</span>from him and said in his thought, “There is no averting of
adversity foredoomed and Allah will do whatso he will;” presently
adding, “O Khwajah, in yonder direction riseth a mountain
Jabal al-Saháb<a id="r502"></a><a href="#f502" class="c012"><sup>[502]</sup></a> hight, which is impenetrable or to mankind or to
Jinn-kind; but given thou avail to reach it thou wilt find therein
and about the middle combe thereof a vast cavern two miles in
breadth by an hundred long. Here, an thou have in thee force
and thou attain thereto and lodge thy daughter, haply shall Allah
Almighty conserve and preserve the maid from what evils thou
heardest the Voice declare to thee for her destiny: however, thou
shalt on no wise reach those highlands until thou shalt have
expended thereon a matter of much money. Moreover at the
head and front of that cave<a id="r503"></a><a href="#f503" class="c012"><sup>[503]</sup></a> is an inner crevice which, extending
to the mountain-top, admitteth daylight into its depths and displayeth
a small pavilion by whose side be five-fold pleasaunce-gardens
with flowers and fruits and rills and trees besprent and
birds hymning Allah, the One, the Omnipotent. Now an thou
avail to convey thy daughter to that place, she shall dwell there
secure, safe-guarded.” As soon as the Khwajah heard those
words from the Fakir, there faded from his heart whatso there
was of thought and forethought and cark and care and he took
the hand of the Religious whom he led to his home and honoured
him and robed him, for that he had indicated such place of protection.
When the maiden reached the age of five and had waxed
killing in beauty, her father brought her a learned Divine with
whom she began reading and who taught her the Koran and
writing and the art of caligraphy;<a id="r504"></a><a href="#f504" class="c012"><sup>[504]</sup></a> and when she had seen the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_377">377</span>first decade, she fell to studying astrology and astronomy and the
aspect of the Heavens. Such was her case; but as regards that
of her sire the Merchant, from the hour he forgathered with the
Darwaysh he ceased not to hold him in his heart and presently he
proposed to take him and travel with him to the mountain aforementioned.
So they set out together and when they reached it
they found it a site right strong as though fortified, and entering
the antre they fell to considering it right and left till they
reached its head where they came upon the little pavilion. After
all this quoth the Fakir, “Indeed such stead shall safe-guard thy
daughter from the shifts of the Nights and the Days;” withal
was he unknowing that the Decreed be determined and must perforce
be done, albeit Doom be depending from the skirts of the
clouds.<a id="r505"></a><a href="#f505" class="c012"><sup>[505]</sup></a> And the Religious ceased not showing the site until he
caused his companion enter the parterres, which he found as they
had been described to him with flowers and fruits and streams and
trees besprent and birds hymning the One, the Omnipotent. As
soon as they had finished solacing themselves with the sights, they
fared back to their town where, during their absence-term, the
damsel’s mother had made ready for them viaticum and presents,
and by the time the twain returned they found ready to hand
everything of travel-gear and all the wants of wayfare. So they
equipped themselves and set forth, taking with them the maiden
together with five white slave-girls and ten negresses and as many
sturdy black chattels who loaded the packs upon the mules’ and
the camels’ backs. Then they fell to cutting across the wilds and
wolds, each and everyone intent upon ministering to the maiden,
and they ceased not faring until they drew near the mountain, and
they took station by the cavern-door. Here they unloaded the
bales and burthens and transported them to the pavilion within
the cave, after which the Merchant’s daughter went in and as she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_378">378</span>walked forwards fell to gazing, rightwards and leftwards, until such
time as she had reached the pavilion. Presently she found it
poikilate of corners and columns, and she was assured that the
distance of that mountain from her father’s town measured the
march of a full-told month. And whenas she had taken seat and
had settled in that pavilion, her father considered the unapproachable
nature of the place and waxed contented of heart and his
mind became right of rede, because he was certified of his daughter
that she was safe from the tricks of Time and every trickster.<a id="r506"></a><a href="#f506" class="c012"><sup>[506]</sup></a> So
he tarried beside her for a decade of days, after which he farewelled
her and wended him home, leaving the damsel in the mountain-cave.
Thus fared it with these; but as regards the case of the
Prince of Al-Irak, his father who owned no issue, or man-child or
girl-child, lay sleeping one night of the nights when, lo and behold!
he heard the words, “All things befal by Fate and Fortune.” Hereat
he arose from slumber being sore startled and cried, “Laud to the
Lord whom I have heard say<a id="r507"></a><a href="#f507" class="c012"><sup>[507]</sup></a> that all things depend upon Doom
and Destiny.” On the next night he slept with his spouse who by
leave of Almighty Allah forthright conceived. When her pregnancy
became manifest the Sovran rejoiced and he scattered and largessed
and doled alms-deeds to the widows and paupers and the mean
and miserable; and he sued the Creator on high saying, “O Lord
vouchsafe to me a man-boy which may succeed me in the reign,
and deign Thou make him a child of life.”<a id="r508"></a><a href="#f508" class="c012"><sup>[508]</sup></a> But when the Queen’s
time had sped she was seized by labour-pangs and delivery-pains,
after which she bare a babe—Glory be to God who created him
and confirmed what He had wrought in the creation of that child
who was like unto a slice of the moon! They committed him to
the wet-nurses who fell to suckling him and tending him and
fondling him till the milk-term was completed, and when his age
<span class="pageno" id="Page_379">379</span>had reached the sixth year, his father brought for him a Divine
perfect in knowledge of all the sciences, spiritual and temporal,
and the craft of penmanship and what not. Accordingly, the boy
began to read and study under his learner until he had excelled
him in every line of lore, and he became a writer deft, doughty in
all the arts and sciences: withal his sire knew not that was doomed
to him of dule and dolours.——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
became a penman doughty in all knowledge, withal he wist not
that was written for him of dule and dolours. This lasted until
his tenth year, and the old King rejoiced in him and caused him
to back steeds until he had mastered all of horsemanship, and he
waxed accomplished in hunting and birding and he had attained
the bourne of <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">omnis res scibilis</span></i>. Every morning he would superintend
the governance of his sire in the office of Commandments
and direct him to affairs wherein lay rede that was right until,
one day of the days, his parent said to him “O my son, do thou
rule for a day and I will govern on the next.” “O my father,”
said he, “I am young of years nor is it meet that I meddle with
<span class="pageno" id="Page_380">380</span>public matters or sit in thy Divan.” Now when he reached the
age of fourteen and had entered upon man’s estate and had waxed
perfect in the words of ordinance and had become complete and
sanspareil in beauty and loveliness, the King resolved upon
marrying him, but he consented not, nor did his heart incline to
womankind for the being in the All-Knowledge of Almighty
Allah all that was foredoomed to him from Time beginningless.
Presently on a chance day his nature longed for the hunt and
chase, and he asked leave of his sire who consented not, fearing
for his safety; but he said in himself, “An I go not I will slay
myself;”<a id="r509"></a><a href="#f509" class="c012"><sup>[509]</sup></a> and so he privily apprized of his intent a party of
his dependents who, all and every, prepared to ride forth with
him into the Desert. Now the King had in his stables a stallion,
known as Abú Hamámah,<a id="r510"></a><a href="#f510" class="c012"><sup>[510]</sup></a> which was kept alone in a smaller
stall, and he was chained by four chains to a like number of
posts<a id="r511"></a><a href="#f511" class="c012"><sup>[511]</sup></a> and was served by two grooms who never could draw
nigh to him or let him loose; nor could any, save only his lord,
approach him with bridle or saddle or aught of horse-gear. But
when the Prince had designed to fare forth a-hunting and
a-birding, he went in to his father’s steed Abu Hamamah by hest
of Allah Almighty’s might over him and for what was hidden to
him in the Future, and found him chained and tethered; and, as the
horse pleased him and affected his fancy, he approached him and
gentled him with caressing hands. The stallion also at that time
under decree of Destiny was influenced by the Lord and directed
towards the Prince for the sake of that which was hidden from
him in the World of Secrets. So he continued to gentle the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_381">381</span>animal and to caress him and to make much of him, and he was
ever the more pleased with him, and said to himself, “Verily my
riding forth to the hunt and chase shall not be save upon this
stallion;” and he ceased not pacing and pressing around him,
soothing him the while, until the steed showed subjection and
neither started nor lashed-out nor indeed moved a limb, but stood
like a man obedient and dependent. And when the youth’s
glance wandered around he saw beside the stallion a closet, and
as he neared it and opened it he found therein all manner harness
and equipments, such as a saddle complete with its girths and
shovel-stirrups and bit and bridle,<a id="r512"></a><a href="#f512" class="c012"><sup>[512]</sup></a> whilst on every side was gear
of warfare enfolded in the furniture, such as scymitar and dagger;<a id="r513"></a><a href="#f513" class="c012"><sup>[513]</sup></a>
and a pair of pistols. So he wondered at this circumstance of
the horse how that none could draw near him or place upon him
that harness, and he likewise marvelled at the subjection of the
steed to himself. Hereupon he carried the furniture from the
closet and going forth with it walked up to the Father of a
Pigeon, which was somewhat fearful of him and affrighted, and he
uplifted the saddle and threw it upon his back, and girthed him
tight and bridled him with the bit, when the horse became
adorned as a bride who is displayed upon her throne. Now the
King’s son at times enquired of himself saying, “An I loose this
horse from his chains he will start away from me;” and at other
times quoth he, “At this hour the stallion will not think of bolting
from me,” and on this wise he abode between belief and unbelief
in his affair. And he stinted not asking of himself until his suite
was a-weary of waiting and of looking at him, so they sent to him
praying that he would hurry, and he said in his thought, “I place
<span class="pageno" id="Page_382">382</span>my trust in Allah, for the Forewritten hath no flight therefrom.”
Anon he loosed the stallion’s chains after harnessing and girthing
him straitly; then, throwing his right leg over his back<a id="r514"></a><a href="#f514" class="c012"><sup>[514]</sup></a> mounted
thereupon with a spring and settled himself in selle and came forth.
And all who looked at that steed were unable to stand upon
the road until the Prince had ridden forwards and had overtaken
the rest of his suite without the town, whence they sought the
hunting-grounds. But when they were amiddlemost the waste
lands and beyond sight of the city, the courser glanced right and
left and tossed his crest and neighed and snorted and ran away;
then shaking his head and buck-jumping under the son of
the Sultan bolted<a id="r515"></a><a href="#f515" class="c012"><sup>[515]</sup></a> with him until he became like a bird
whereof is seen no trace nor will trick avail to track.<a id="r516"></a><a href="#f516" class="c012"><sup>[516]</sup></a> When his
folk beheld him they were impotent to govern their horses until
their lord had vanisht from their view, nor had anyone the muscle
or the manhood to keep up pursuit. So waxing perplext and
wildered in their wits they sought counsel one of other saying,
“Let each and every of us ride by a separate road until such a
day when haply we shall meet him.” Hereupon the whole party
dispersed and all took their own directions seeking the Prince; and
they stinted not search, anon putting out to speed and anon retracing
their steps<a id="r517"></a><a href="#f517" class="c012"><sup>[517]</sup></a> and then returning by the same road. This
<span class="pageno" id="Page_383">383</span>endured for five days when not a soul came upon their liege lord,
so they waxed distraught nor could they find right guidance to
aught they should do. However when the trysting-day came, all
gathered together and said, “Fare we to the Sultan and acquaint
we him with this and let him devise a device for the matter of his
son; because this youth is his father’s prop and stay, nor owneth
he any other than this one.” Hereupon they set out citywards
and ceased not riding until they drew near the capital where they
found a marquee pitched without the walls, and having considered
it they knew it to be the King’s own. So they drew near it and
there found the Chamberlains and Nabobs and officers of high commandment
standing round about it, and when they asked saying,
“What is the cause for setting up yonder tent in such place?” they
were answered, “Verily, whenas his son fared from him designing
to hunt and bird, on the next day his heart was straitened for the
Youth and he wist not what had befallen him. On the first night
when the Prince fared forth from him and disappeared, all went
well, but on the second his breast was straitened and in his vitals
he sensed a change and ’twas at the hour when the stallion began
buck-jumping with his child and running away. Anon he lost all
patience and was unable to endure session within his Palace so he
commanded pitch his pavilion without the walls and here we have
been sitting for a space of six days, awaiting the escort to return.”
As the party drew near the marquee the bruit of them went abroad
until it came to the King’s ears.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
feeling his breast a-straitened bade pitch his pavilion without the
walls and tarried therein for a space of six days and on the seventh
appeared his son’s suite which had been left behind when the horse
ran away with the Prince, nor did any know what direction the
beast had taken. As soon as the bruit went abroad and came to
the ears of the bereaved father, he cried out with a single outcry
and fell to the ground aswoon, and the fainting fit lasted for two
days. But when he came to himself and asked after his son, the
suite reported all that had befallen the youth from the stallion and
at that moment the King recalled to mind the Voice which had
spoken saying, “All things befal by Fate and Fortune;” and had
declared, “Resignation to the trials sent by Allah is first and best
till such time as Destiny shall win to her end.” “If” (he mused)
“my lot be forgathering with him anywheres then needs must it
be; and, if otherwise, we will be patient under the All-might of
Allah Most Highest.” Such was the case with these; but as
concerns the young Prince,<a id="r518"></a><a href="#f518" class="c012"><sup>[518]</sup></a> when the stallion started off with him
and bolted and became like a bird flying between the firmament
and terra firma, he suffered nor fatigue nor emotion, nay, he sat
contented upon the beast’s back, for that had he hent in hand a
cup full of coffee naught thereof would have been spilt. And the
stallion ceased not galloping at speed with him through the livelong
<span class="pageno" id="Page_385">385</span>day until night came on when, seeing a lake, he halted by the
side of it. The Prince thereupon dismounted and withdrawing
the bridle offered him water which he drank; then he foddered
him with forage which he ate, for our Lord had subjected to him
that steed till it became between his hands like one familiar from
the first and, as the youth had somewhat of provaunt in his
budget he drew forth of it and took food. But the Prince knew
not whither the horse was minded to bear him and the Fiat of
Fate drove him to the matter foredoomed to him from Eternity.
So after that time as often as he mounted and let loose the bridle
thongs,<a id="r519"></a><a href="#f519" class="c012"><sup>[519]</sup></a> the horse paced unguided on those wilds and wastes
and hills and dales and stony leas, and whenever they drew near
a city or a town the son of the Sultan dismounted from his steed;
and, leaving him where he was, went into the streets in order to
bring provaunt and forage, after which he could return to his beast
and feed him in the same place. And he ceased not wayfaring
until he drew near a city where he designed to dismount as was
his wont and lay in somewhat of vivers and fodder, so he alighted
and leaving his horse outside the houses he went in to satisfy his
need. Now by the decree of the Decreer the King of that Capital
had left it on an excursion to hunt and bird, and he chanced return
at that moment and as he drew near the walls behold, he found
the steed standing alone and harnessed with trappings fit for the
Kings. The Sultan was astounded when he looked upon this
and being on horseback himself he designed to draw near and
catch the animal, and when he came close he put forth his hand.
But the steed was scared with the scaring of a camel, and the King
bade his followers form ring around him and seize him; so they
gat about him and designed to catch him and lead him away, when
suddenly the steed screamed a scream which resounded throughout
the city and when the horses heard the cry of that stallion they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_386">386</span>turned with their riders in headlong flight and dispersed one from
other. And amongst them was the Sultan, who, when his courser
ran away with him, strove hard to pull him up and control him,
but he lost all power and whilst the rest of the horses were
trembling under their riders he swooned and fell to the ground.
Presently the followers came to his aid and found him in fainting
condition, so they propped him up and sprinkled somewhat of
water upon him, when he recovered and asked them, “Where is
the horse?” Answered they, “He is still standing in the same
place;” and quoth he, “Walláhi, needs must this affair have a
cause, and do ye lie awaiting him and see whither he will wend,
for this beast God wots must be of the Jinns.” On this wise it
befel them; but as regards the horse’s owner, the son of the
Sultan, when he entered the city seeking to buy somewhat of
victual and fodder, he heard the scream of the steed and recognised
it, but of the city-folk all who had hearkened to that outcry felt
their hearts fluttering with extreme affright; so each one rose and
padlocked his shop and hardly believed that he could reach his
house in safety and this continued until the capital (even within its
bazars) became empty like a waste, a ruin. Hereupon quoth the
youth, “By Allah, needs must some matter of the matters have
befallen the horse,” and so saying he went forth the city and
walked on till he neared the site where he had left the steed when,
behold, he came suddenly upon a party of people in the middlemost
whereof appeared one sitting and trembling in all his limbs,
and he saw the attendants standing about him and each one
holding in hand a horse. So he drew near him and asked him
what was to do and they acquainted him with the affair of the
stallion and his scream and the cause of the man being seated;
and this was none other than the Sultan who had been seized with
affright and had fainted at the outcry of the Father of a Pigeon.
Hereupon he fell to conversing with them and they knew not that
he was the owner of the steed until such time as he asked them,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_387">387</span>“And doth not any of you avail to draw near him?” Answered
they, “O Youth, indeed there is none who can approach him.”
Quoth he, “This is a matter which is easy to us and therein is no
hindrance;” and so saying he left them and turned towards the
courser who no sooner saw him than he shook his head at him;
and he approached the beast and fell to stroking his coat and
kissing him upon the brow. After this he strewed somewhat of
fodder before him and offered him water and the stallion ate and
drank until he was satisfied. All this and the suite of the Sultan
was looking on at the Prince and presently informed their lord,
saying, “O King of the Age, a Youth hath come to us and asked
as for information touching this steed and when we told him what
had happened he approached him and gentled him and bussed
him on the brow; and after that he strewed before him somewhat
of forage which he ate and gave him water to drink and still he
standeth hard by him.” When the Sultan heard these words he
marvelled and cried, “By Allah, indeed this is a wondrous matter,
but do ye fare to him and bring him to me, him and his horse;
and, if he make aught delay with you, seize and pinion him and
drag him before me debased and degraded and in other than plight
pleasurable!”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
<span class="pageno" id="Page_388">388</span>love and good will? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King sent
to his suite bidding them bring the owner of that stallion adding,
“If he make aught delay with you drag him before me debased
and degraded, and in other than pleasurable plight.” Accordingly,
they went to him and accosting him said, “O Youth, thou owest
hearing and obeying to His Highness the King; and, if thou come
not to him with good gree we will bear thee maugre thyself.” But
the Prince, hearing these their words, set his left foot in stirrup and
throwing his right leg over the saddle mounted till he was firm of
seat upon his stallion’s back and had power over his monture.
Then he asked saying, “Who amongst you shall come near me
or carry me to yonder Sultan of yours?” Whenas they saw this
from him they kept away from his arm-reach, but inasmuch as
they could not return to their King and report saying, “We availed
not to bring him,” they exclaimed, “Allah upon thee, O Youth,
that thou draw nigh with us to the Sovran and bespeak him from
the back of thy steed: so shall we be clear and bear nor rebuke
nor reproach.” Hearing this much the Prince understood what
was in their thoughts and that their design was to win free of the
King and the avoidance of blame; accordingly he said to them;
“Fare ye before me and I will follow you.”<a id="r520"></a><a href="#f520" class="c012"><sup>[520]</sup></a> But when they
returned with the youth behind them to within a short distance of
the King where either of the twain could hear the other’s words,
the Prince asked, “O King of the Age, what dost thou require of
me and what is it thou wantest?” “Do thou dismount,” answered
the Sultan, “and draw near me when I will tell thee and question
thee of a certain matter:” but quoth the youth, “I will not alight
<span class="pageno" id="Page_389">389</span>from the back of my steed and let whoso hath a claim upon me
demand satisfaction,<a id="r521"></a><a href="#f521" class="c012"><sup>[521]</sup></a> for here be the Maydán—the field of fight.”
So saying he wheeled his steed and would have made for the open
country, when the Sultan cried aloud to his followers, “Seize him
and bring him hither.” So they took horse all of them, a matter
of one hundred and fifty riders, and followed him at full speed
(he still riding) and overtook him and formed a ring around him,
and he seeing this shortened the bridle-reins and gored flanks with
stirrup-irons when the beast sprang from under him like the wafting
of the wind. Then he cried out to them, “Another day, O ye
dogs;” and no sooner had they heard his outcry than they turned
from him flying and to safety hieing. When the Sultan beheld
his followers, some hundred and fifty riders, returning to the
presence in headlong flight and taking station before him, he
enquired the cause of their running, and they replied that none
could approach that horseman, adding, “Verily he cried a warcry
which caused each and every of us to turn and flee, for that we
deemed him one of the Jánn.” “Woe to you!” exclaimed the
King: “an hundred and fifty riders and not avail to prevail over
a single horseman!” presently adding, “By Allah, his say was
sooth who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">And how many an one in the tribe they count ✿ When to one a thousand shall ne’er amount?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Verily this youth could not be confronted by a thousand, nor
indeed could a whole tribe oppose him, and by Allah, I have been
deficient in knightly devoir for not doing him honour; however, it
was not to be save on such wise.” But the youth ceased not faring
through days and nights for the whole of four months, unknowing
the while when he should reach a place wherein to take repose.
And as soon as this long wayfare ended, suddenly a mountain
towering high to the heights of heaven arose before him; so he
<span class="pageno" id="Page_390">390</span>set his face thither, and after a further term of three days<a id="r522"></a><a href="#f522" class="c012"><sup>[522]</sup></a> (and
he ever wayfaring) he reached it and beheld upon its flanks fair
leasows with grasses and rills and trees and fruits besprent, and
birds hymning Allah the One, the Omnipotent. Anon he alighted
therein for that his heart had somewhat to say anent that mountain,
and he also marvelled thereat by cause that during his wayfare he
had never seen aught like it at all, nor anything resembling that
herbage and those streams. And after dismounting he unbridled
his steed and suffered him browse and pasture upon the greenery
and drink of the water, while he on like wise fell to eating of the
fruits which hung from the trees and taking his ease and repose.
But the more he shifted from place to place the fairer he found it
than the first, so he was delighted with the site, and as he looked
upon it he improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O who fearest the world do thou feel right safe; ✿ Trust all to Him did mankind create:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">The Sultan’s son ceased not straying from stead to stead for a
term of ten days, during which he wandered round about the
Mountain and solaced himself by gazing upon the trees and
waters,<a id="r523"></a><a href="#f523" class="c012"><sup>[523]</sup></a> and he was gladdened by the warbling of the birds till at
length the Doom of Destiny and the Fiat of Fate cast him over
against the door of the cave which contained the Khwajah’s
daughter with her handmaids and her negro slaves. He looked
at the entrance and marvelled and was perplexed at——And
<span class="pageno" id="Page_391">391</span>Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
King’s son took place before the Cavern-door he marvelled at its
strength intended to protect those within, but he knew not if it
had any inmate or an it were void of inhabitants, seeing that the
mountain was far distant and divided from towns and cities nor
could any avail to reach it. So he said in his mind, “Sit thee
down here over against the entrance amid these grasses and trees
and fruits, for an thou quit this site thou shalt find none like it in
charms and eke it shall console thee for parting from thy people.
Moreover, haply shall someone of this place pass by me and from
him I may ask tidings concerning this region and peradventure
Almighty Allah shall guide me back to my own country and I
shall forgather with my father and my folk and my friends.
Indeed possibly there may be someone within this place who
when he issueth forth shall become my familiar.” So he ceased
not sitting at the door of the cave for a term of twenty days
eating of the fruits of the trees and drinking of the water of the
rain pools as likewise did his steed; but when it was the twenty
<span class="pageno" id="Page_392">392</span>and first day, behold, the door of the antre was thrown open and
there came forth it two black slave-girls and a negro chattel,
followed five white hand-maidens, all seeking diversion and
disport among those meadows which lay on the mountain-flank
and beyond. But as they paced along their eyes fell on the son of
the Sultan who was still sitting there with his steed before him
and they found him cast in the mould of beauty and loveliness,
for he had now rested in that place from his wayfare and the
perfection of charms was manifest upon him. When the slave-girls
looked at him they were overwhelmed by the marvels of
his comeliness and shapeliness and they returned in haste and
hurry to their mistress and said to her, “O our lady, verily at
the cavern-door is a Youth, never saw we a fairer than he or a
seemlier of semblance, and in very deed he resembleth thee in
grace and elegance of face and form, and before him standeth a
steed even as a bride.” Now when the Merchant’s daughter heard
these words from her handmaidens, she arose and in haste and
hurry made for the cave-door and her heart was filled with
gladness and she ceased not walking till she reached it. Then
she looked upon the Prince and came forward and embraced him<a id="r524"></a><a href="#f524" class="c012"><sup>[524]</sup></a>
and gave him the salam and she continued to gaze upon and
consider his beauty and comeliness, until love to him settled in her
heart and likewise the Prince’s love to her increased. Hereupon
she hent him by the hand and led him into the cavern where he
fell to looking rightwards and leftwards about the sides thereof
and wondering at what he saw therein of pleasaunces and trees
and streams and birds, until at last they reached the pavilion.
But before entering thither the Prince had led his horse and loosed
him in the leasows which lay in the cavern; and, when at last the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_393">393</span>twain ended at the palace and went within, the attendants brought
meat for him; so he ate his sufficiency and they washed his hands
and then the couple fell to conversing together whilst all were
delighted with the son of the King. And they continued in such
case until night drew nigh when each of the handmaidens went to
her chamber and lay her down and on like wise did the black
slaves until there remained none save the Prince and the
Merchant’s daughter. Then began she to excite him and incite
him and disport with him until his heart inclined towards her by
reason of her toyings and her allurements, so he drew near to her
and clasped her to his breast and at last he threw her upon her
back and did away her maidenhead. Now by hest of Allah
Almighty’s All-might she conceived of him that very night and
they ceased not to be in sport and laughter until the Creator
brought on the dawn which showed its sheen and shone and the
sun arose over lowland and lawn. Then did the twain, she and
he, sit communing together, when the girl began to improvise
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Loving maid in obedience doth come ✿ Trailing skirt with her pride all astir;</div>

    </div>
  </div>

<p class="c000">After this the Khwajah’s daughter tarried with the King’s son for
a term of six months; but, from the night when he had abated her
pucelage, he never approached her at all, and she also on like wise
felt no lust of the flesh for him in any way nor did she solicit him
to love-liesse.<a id="r526"></a><a href="#f526" class="c012"><sup>[526]</sup></a> But when it was the seventh month, the youth
remembered his family and native land and he sought leave of her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_394">394</span>to travel but she said to him, “Why dost thou not tarry beside
us?” Said he, “If in our life there be due length needs must we
forgather.” Then asked she, “O my lord, who mayest thou be?”
so he declared to her his pedigree and degree and the name of his
native country and she also informed him of her rank and lineage
and her patrial stead. Presently he farewelled her and mounting
his horse fared forth from her in early morning,——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive.”

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King’s son
farewelled the Merchant’s daughter and fared forth from her in
early morning, seeking his folk and his natal land, and he drove
amiddlemost the wilds and the wolds. On this wise it was
with him; but as regards the merchant, the father of the damsel,
he and the Darwaysh after consigning her to the cavern returned
to his town and there spent six months in business as was his
wont; but on the seventh he called to mind his child and was
desolated by her absence because he had none other. So quoth
he to her mother, “I have an intent to visit the girl and look upon
her and see what may be her condition, for my heart is in sore
doubt on her account and I cannot but fancy that some unforeseen
<span class="pageno" id="Page_395">395</span>casualty hath brought calamity or that some wayfarer may have
visited her; and my thoughts are occupied with her, so ’tis my
will to fare forth and see her.” “Such act were advisable,” quoth
the wife; and so saying she fell to making him somewhat of provaunt
amounting to some ten camel-loads.<a id="r527"></a><a href="#f527" class="c012"><sup>[527]</sup></a> Presently he led forth
with him a few of his negro slaves and set out to see his daughter
on the Jabal al-Saháb. So he dove into the depths of the desert
and cut across the dales and the hills and conjoined the
journeyings of night with day for a space of three months, and
about sunset-tide on the first of the fourth behold, a rider appeared
to him coming from the breast of the waste, nor had he with him
anyone. When the stranger drew near, the Khwajah saluted him
and his salam was returned by the horseman who happened to be
the Prince returning from the Merchant’s daughter. Quoth the
Khwajah, “O Youth, dismount with us in this place and let us
twain, I and thou, night together and solace ourselves with converse;<a id="r528"></a><a href="#f528" class="c012"><sup>[528]</sup></a>
then, when it shall be morning, each of us shall depart seeking
his own stead.” Quoth the Prince, “No harm in that,” and so
saying he sprang from the back of his steed and unbridled him and
suffered him to browse upon the grasses and greenery together
with the Khwajah’s cattle. Hereat the two sat down together in
talk while the slaves slaughtered a lamb and flayed it, then, having
lighted a fire, they set the meat thereupon in a chauldron and
when it was cooked they fished it out with a flesh-hook and scored
it<a id="r529"></a><a href="#f529" class="c012"><sup>[529]</sup></a> and placed it in a mighty platter which they served up to their
lord and the King’s son. Both ate of it after the measure of their
sufficiency and the remnants were borne off by the slaves for their
suppers. And when the time for night-prayers came, the two
<span class="pageno" id="Page_396">396</span>having made the Wuzú ablution performed the orisons obligatory
upon them, and anon sat down for evening converse, overtalking
the tidings of the world and its affairs, until quoth the Merchant
to the Prince, “O Youth, whence comest thou and whither art
thou wending?” Quoth the other, “Walláhi, O Khwajah, I have
a wondrous tale, nay a marvel of marvels which, were it graved
with needle-gravers upon the eye-corners were a warning to whoso
would be warned. And this it is, I am the King’s son of Al-Irak
and my sire’s prop and stay in the House of the World, and he
reared me with the fairest of rearing; but when I had grown to
man’s estate and had learnt the mysteries of venerie I longed one
chance day of the days to ride forth hunting and birding. So I
went for a horse (as was my wont) to the stables, where I found
yon stallion which is with me chained to four posts; whereupon of
my ignorance, unknowing that none could approach him save
myself nor any avail to mount him, I went up to him and girthed
him, and he neither started nor moved at my gentling of him, for
this was existing in the purpose of Almighty Allah. Then I
mounted him and sought my suite without informing my sire and
rode forth the city with all my many, when suddenly the horse
snorted with his nostrils and neighed through his throttle and
buckjumped in air and bolted for the wilderness swift as bird in
firmament-plain, nor wist I whither he was intending.<a id="r530"></a><a href="#f530" class="c012"><sup>[530]</sup></a> He ceased
not running away with me the whole day till eventide when we
reached a lake in a grassy mead.” (Now when the Khwajah
heard the words of the Prince his heart was heartened and
presently the other pursued), “So I took seat and ate somewhat
of my vivers, my horse also feeding upon his fodder, and we
nighted in that spot and next morning I set out and stinted not
riding for a march of four months. But on the first of the fifth
I neared a towering mountain whose length and whose breadth
<span class="pageno" id="Page_397">397</span>had no bounds, and on its flanks I found leasows manifold with
trees and fruits and streams besprent and birds hymning the One,
the Omnipotent. So I was gladdened by the sight and dismounted
and unbridled my steed whom I allowed to browse the while I ate
of the fruits, and presently I fell to roaming about from site to site.
And when some time had passed I came to the mouth of a cavern
whence after a short delay on my part fared forth slave-girls under
the escort of a negro chattel. When they beheld me they rejoiced
in me, then going in they disappeared for an hour and anon
returned bringing a young lady as she was the moon of the fourteenth
night, who salam’d to me, and invited me to become her
guest and led me into the cave”——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive.”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Eight Hundred and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
continued to the Merchant saying:—The slave-girls invited me and
led me into the cave until I reached a Pavilion that was there. I
tarried beside them for a matter of some six months when I felt
desolate for my folk and my native land, so I craved leave to depart
from them and farewelled them and went forth, they sending me
away with highmost honour. But when bidding them good-bye,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_398">398</span>I covenanted with them saying, “an there be in life any length
needs must we forgather; and with these words I left them, and
now ’tis some time since I journeyed thence when thou mettest me
in this place.” Now the Merchant hearing his tale knew from the
beginning what had occurred there, and was certified of the saying
of the Voice, and judging from the tenor of the information said
in his mind, “There is no doubt or hesitation but that this be the
youth to whom was appointed my daughter, that of him she should
conceive in the way of unright and the Written<a id="r531"></a><a href="#f531" class="c012"><sup>[531]</sup></a> is now fulfilled.”
So quoth the Merchant, “O Youth, where is thy town?” and he
informed him thereof. Now the Prince knew not that he had come
upon the damsel’s father by the road, whereas the Khwajah wotted
right well that this man had had to do with his daughter. As
soon as it was morning the twain farewelled each other and either
of them went his own way; but, the Khwajah fell into cark and
care such as cannot be conceived, and he fasted from food nor was
meat to him sweet nor was sleep. However, he ceased not travelling
till he arrived at the Jabal al-Sahab, when he approached the door
of the cave and rapped thereat. The handmaidens opened to him
and as soon as they saw his face they recognised him, and returning
to their lady informed her thereof: so she arose to seek him,
and presently met him and salam’d to him and kissed his hands
and walked by his side until she reached the Pavilion, where the
twain, he and she, went up, and she seated him and stood before
him in his suit and service. Hereat her father looked at her and
considered her and found her colour changed and her belly
grown big, and asked her, “What is to do with thee and what is’t
hath altered thy complexion, for to-day I see thee heavy of body,
and no doubt some man has mixed<a id="r532"></a><a href="#f532" class="c012"><sup>[532]</sup></a> with thee?” Now when she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_399">399</span>heard the words of her father she understood and was certified
that he had compassed full knowledge concerning what had befallen
her, so she returned him nor answer nor address, and she was overwhelmed
with shame and confusion, and waxed changed and was
well nigh falling upon the floor. Presently she sat down in abashment
before her sire by reason of the bigness of her belly, but he
bowed in obedience before the power of Almighty Allah; and
they two ceased not conversing until fall of night, when each and
every of the handmaids had sought her own chamber that she
might sleep therein. As soon as the Khwajah remained alone
with his daughter and without other being present he said to her,
“O my child, verily this matter was foredoomed to thee from the
Lord of the Heavens, and there is no Averter of whatso is fated;
but do thou relate to me what befel between thee and the youth
who owneth the steed, and who is the King’s son of Al-Irak.”
Hereupon the girl was consterned and she could return no reply,
and presently when she recovered she said to her sire, “How shall
I relate to one who is already informed of all, first and last, and
thou declarest that the foredoomed must come to pass, nor can I
say thereanent a single word?” And presently she resumed, “O
my father, verily the Youth promised me that an his life have
length he would certainly forgather with me, and I desire of thee
that when thou shalt return to thy country thou take me and carry
me in thy company to him, and reunite me with him and let me
meet his sire and ask him to keep his word, for I require none else
nor shall anyone ever unveil me in privacy. And in fine do thou
marry me to him. Now whatso hath betided me thou hast heard
it from the Voice, and thou hast wearied thy soul in transporting
me to this place, fearing for me the shifts of the days, and thou
hast contraried the power of Allah, nor hath this profited thee
aught, because the Destinies which be writ upon mankind from
<span class="pageno" id="Page_400">400</span>infinity and eternity must needs be carried out. All this was
determined by Allah, for that prosperity and adversity and benefaction
and interdiction all be from the Almighty. Do thou
whatso I have said and that which is inscribed upon my forehead
shall be the quickening of me (Inshallah—an so please God!),
since patience and longsuffering are better than restless thought.”
When her father heard from her such words, he agreed with her in
all she had spoken to him, and as soon as it was morning he fell to
preparing for wayfare, he and his daughter and his handmaidens
and his negro-slaves; and on the third day they loaded their loads
and set forth on return to their country and city. Then they conjoined
the travel of night and day and pushed forward on their
journey without stay or delay for a term of five months, until they
reached their home and settled them down therein. Such was
their case; but as regards the King’s son of Al-’Irak, after he had
met the girl’s father on the road and had parted from him, without
recognising him withal, he strave for return to his own land and
behold, he wandered from the way and was confronted by a sea
dashing with clashing billows. So he was perplext as to his affair
and his judgment left him and his right wits, and he knew not
what he should do or whither he should wend, or what direction
he should take or what Allah had decreed for him——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Third Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
<span class="pageno" id="Page_401">401</span>the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Prince came upon that sea he was perplext and wist not what to
do, so he leapt from the back of the Father of the Pigeon and set
his steed standing beside him that he might lean against his quarter<a id="r533"></a><a href="#f533" class="c012"><sup>[533]</sup></a>
when, of the excess of his night watching, he fell asleep and
was drowned in slumber. Then, by doom of Destiny the beast
shook his head and snorted and set off at full speed making for the
wild and the wold and was presently amiddlemost the waste. Now
when some two-told hours of time had passed, the Prince shook
off his drowsihead and opened his eyes, but of his steed he could
see nor sign nor aught of visible trace. So he smote hand upon
hand and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great,” after which he took seat by the
side of the sea and sued comfort of Almighty Allah. On the next
day a ship suddenly sailed in and made fast to the shore, after which
a posse of Jews landed from her and as soon as they saw him they
fell upon him and seized him and pinioned him; then, carrying
him perforce aboard, loaded his legs with irons. So quoth he to
himself, “Whenas Fate is so minded our eyes are blinded; however,
patience is fairest and of Allah must we ask aidance.” Hereupon
the Jews again disembarked and filled their kegs with the water
of an adjoining rain-pool, after which they trooped aboard and
making sail voyaged over the billows of the ocean before them.
This lasted for a month, after which time they cast anchor
beside a harbour-town, and presently swarmed out to sell and to
buy, and there they delayed for a term of two months until they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_402">402</span>had finished their business and they had purchased them what
sufficed of provaunt. All this while the Prince lay bound in the
black hole deep down in the ship’s hold, nor did anyone go near
him save a Jew, a man of a certain age.<a id="r534"></a><a href="#f534" class="c012"><sup>[534]</sup></a> And whenever he
entered that dismal place he heard the youth reciting from the
Koran and he would stand to hearken until his heart was softened
to the speaker and he would favour him in the matter of meat and
drink. When they cast anchor beside the second place, the King’s
son asked the man, “What may be this port-city and what is her
name and the name of her ruler? Would Heaven I wot an her
lord be a King or a Governor under a royal hand?” “Wherefore
askest thou?” quoth the Jew, and quoth the other, “For nothing:
my only want is the city’s name<a id="r535"></a><a href="#f535" class="c012"><sup>[535]</sup></a> and I would learn whether it
belong to Moslems or Jews or Nazarenes.” “This be peopled by
Moslem folk,” replied the Jew, “natheless can none carry tidings
of thee to her inhabitants. However, O Moslem, I feel a fondness
for thee and ’tis my intent when we reach the city of Andalús<a id="r536"></a><a href="#f536" class="c012"><sup>[536]</sup></a> to
give tidings of thee, but it must be on condition that thou accept
of me to thy company whenas Allah Almighty shall have delivered
thee.” Said the Prince, “And what hindereth thee from Al-Islam
at this hour?” and said the other, “I am forbidden by fear of the
ship’s Captain.<a id="r537"></a><a href="#f537" class="c012"><sup>[537]</sup></a>” Replied the Prince, “Become a Moslem in
secret and wash and pray in privacy beside me here.” So he
became of the True Believers at the hand of the King’s son,
who presently asked him, “Say me, be there in this vessel any
Moslems save myself?” “There are some twenty here,” answered
<span class="pageno" id="Page_403">403</span>he, “and ’tis the design of the Captain to offer them up on
arrival at his own country and he shall devote them as victims
in the Greater Synagogue.” Rejoined the other, “Thou art now a
Moslem even as I am a Moslem, and it besitteth thou apprise me
of all and whatsoever befalleth in the ship, but first art thou
able to gar me forgather with the other True Believers?” And
the man answered in the affirmative. Now after the ship had
sailed with them for ten days, the whilome Jew contrived to
bring him and the Moslem prisoners together and they were found
to number twenty, each and every in irons. But when it was the
Sabbath about undurn hour, all the Jews including the Captain fell
to wine-bibbing and therein exceeded until the whole of them
waxed drunken; whereat the Prince and his convert arose, and
going to the armoury<a id="r538"></a><a href="#f538" class="c012"><sup>[538]</sup></a> and opening it found therein all manner war-gear,
even habergeons. So the Youth returned to the captives and
unbinding their bonds, led them to the cabin of weapons and said
to them, “Do each and every of you who shall find aught befitting
take it and let such as avail to wear coat of mail seize one of them
and don it.” On this wise he heartened their hearts and cried to
them, “Unless ye do the deeds of men you will be slaughtered with
the slaughtering of sheep, for at this moment ’tis their design on
reaching their own land to offer you up as corbans in their Greater
Synagogue. So be you on your guard and, if ye fall in this affair,<a id="r539"></a><a href="#f539" class="c012"><sup>[539]</sup></a>
’tis fairer for you than to die with split weasands.” So each of
them snatched up whatso of war gear suited him and one equipped
other and they heartened their hearts and all waxed eager for the
fray. Then sallied they forth, one and twenty in number, at a
single word, with the Takbír and the Tahlíl,<a id="r540"></a><a href="#f540" class="c012"><sup>[540]</sup></a> whilst the Jews who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_404">404</span>formed the ship’s crew were some one hundred and five. But
these were all drunken with wine and giddy of head, nor did
they recover until the weapons began to play upon their necks and
their backs, whereat they shook off their crapulence and learned
that the Moslems had gotten about them with their war-gear.
So they cried out to one another and became ware and the
liquor-fumes left their brains. Then they rushed for the armoury
but found that most of the weapons were with the Moslems, whom
the Prince was urging to derring-do of cut and thrust. Thus
were they departed into two portions and hardly had passed an
hour, an hour which would grey the hair of a little child, in fight
and fray and onset and retreat——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and
tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince
urged on his party and fortified their hearts to fight, nor had an
hour passed in battle and slaughter (and he smiting rightwards
and leftwards) when behold, he was encountered by the Captain
who sprang at him with his scymitar and designed to cut him
down. But he forestalled him with sway of sabre and smote him
<span class="pageno" id="Page_405">405</span>a swashing stroke and an all-sufficient which share through his
joints and tare through his limbs; and when the ship’s crew saw
their Chief fall dead they gave in their submission<a id="r541"></a><a href="#f541" class="c012"><sup>[541]</sup></a> and throwing
down their weapons would have saved their lives. The Prince,
however, went forward to them and fell to pinioning them, one
after other, until he had bound them all, after which he counted
them and found them to number about forty head while the slain
were three score and five. These he threw into the sea,<a id="r542"></a><a href="#f542" class="c012"><sup>[542]</sup></a> but the
captives he placed in prison after chaining them with iron chains
and they padlocked the doors upon them; and the Moslems
worked the ship’s sails while the man who had newly islamised
directed them upon their course until they moored at a holm hard
by the mainland. Here they landed and found the place abounding
in blooms and trees and streams, and the Prince left the ship to
reconnoitre the continent when suddenly a dust cloud drew nigh
and a sand-pillar soared awhile in air high; then it uncovered
some fifty horsemen, and they were pursuing in the hottest of
haste,<a id="r543"></a><a href="#f543" class="c012"><sup>[543]</sup></a> a stallion which was saddled and bridled and which they
intended to secure. Now for ten days they had galloped after
him but none availed to catch him. When the King’s son looked
upon that case he uttered a loud cry and the courser, hearing the
sound of his master’s voice, made for him and fell to rubbing his
cheeks upon his back and shoulders<a id="r544"></a><a href="#f544" class="c012"><sup>[544]</sup></a> until they came up with him
as he was standing beside his lord. Hereat all the riders dismounted
<span class="pageno" id="Page_406">406</span>with intent to seize him, but the Prince opposed them
saying, “This is my horse and he was lost from me in such a place
upon the margin of the main.” Replied they, “’Tis well, but this
is our booty nor will we ever leave him to thee, for that during the
last ten days we have galloped after him until we are melted, and
our horses are melted as well as ourselves. Moreover, our King
awaiteth us and if we return without the steed our heads will be
cut off.” Quoth the Prince, “Nor ye nor that Sovran of yours can
have any command over him, albeit you may have pursued him at
speed for ten days or fifteen days or twenty days; nor shall you
make him a quarry or for yourselves or for the King of you. By
Allah, one Sultan was unable to take even a hair from him and,
by the Almighty! were you to pursue him for a full-told year not
one of you could come up with him or make him your own.”
Hereupon talk increased between them and one drew weapon
upon other and there befel between them contest and enmity and
rage of bad blood and each clapt hand to sword and drew it from
sheath. When the King’s son saw this from them, he sprang upon
the steed’s back swiftlier than the blinding leven; and, having
settled himself firmly in selle, he put forth his hand and seized a
sword which hung by the saddle bow. As soon as the folk saw
that he had mounted the horse, they charged upon him with their
scymitars and would have cut him down, but he made his steed
curvet and withdrew from them saying, “An you design battle I
am not fain of fight, and do ye all go about your business and
covet not the horse lest your greed deceive you and you ask more
than enough and thereby fall into harm. This much we know
and if you require aught else let the strongest and doughtiest of
you do his best.” Then they charged upon him a second time
and a third time and he warded them off and cried, “Allah draw
the line between me and you,<a id="r545"></a><a href="#f545" class="c012"><sup>[545]</sup></a> O folk, and do ye gang your gait
<span class="pageno" id="Page_407">407</span>for you be fifty riders and I be alone and singlehanded and how
shall one contend in fight with half an hundred?” Cried they,
“Naught shall save thee from us except thou dismount from the
steed and suffer us to take him and return home with him;”——And

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the fifty
horsemen said to the King’s son, “There is no help but that we
take from thee the horse,” and said he, “I have given you good
advice, and well I wot and am certified that were you two hundred
riders ye could never prevail over me whilst I am mounted on my
courser’s back and indeed I have no fear of fight; but let any of
you who hath claim to knightlihood come forwards and take him
and mount him.” So saying he alighted forthright and left his
horse and went to some distance from him, when one of the
fifty riders pushed forwards and designed to seize the steed by
the reins and bestride him, when suddenly the stallion raged like
fire at him and attacked him and smote him with his forehand and
drove the entrails out of his belly and the man at once fell to the
ground slain. As his party saw this they bared their brands and
assaulted the horse designing to cut him in pieces when behold, a
<span class="pageno" id="Page_408">408</span>dust-cloud high in lift upflew and walled the view; and all extended
their glances in that direction for an hour of time until it opened
and showed some two hundred knights headed by a King mighty
of degree and majesty and over his head were flags a-flying. The
fifty horsemen, seeing him advance with his troops, drew off and
stood still to look and see whom he might be, and when the
horse sighted these banners he sniffed with nostrils opened wide to
the air, and made for them at full speed, as if gladdened by the
sight, and approached them and returned to them a second time
in like guise and at the third time he drew up hard beside them and
nearing the King fell to rubbing his cheeks upon the stirrups whilst
the ruler put forth his hand and gentled the steed by smoothing
his head and forehead. As soon as the fifty riders saw this, they
marvelled thereat, but the King’s son who had kept his ground
was astounded and said to himself, “The horse fled me and when
this host drew nigh he sought me again.”<a id="r546"></a><a href="#f546" class="c012"><sup>[546]</sup></a> Presently the Prince
fixed his glance upon the latest comers and behold, the King was
his father, so he sprang to him and when the sire saw him he
knew his son and footed it and the twain embraced and fell fainting
to the ground for awhile. When they recovered the suite of
the Sultan came forward and salam’d to the Prince who presently
asked his sire, “What may be the cause of thy coming to this
plain?” and the ruler informed him by way of answer that after
his child’s departure slumber to him brought no rest nor was
there in food aught of zest and with him longing overflowed for
the sake of his son, so that after a while of time he and the
grandees of his realm had marched forth, and he ended by saying,
“O my son, our leaving home was for the sake of thee, but do thou
tell me what befel thee after mounting the Father of a Pigeon, and
what was the cause of thy coming to this spot.” Accordingly the
Prince told all that had betided him, first and last, of his durance
<span class="pageno" id="Page_409">409</span>vile amongst the Jews and how he had devised the killing of the
Captain and the capture of the craft; and how the steed, after being
lost in the waste,<a id="r547"></a><a href="#f547" class="c012"><sup>[547]</sup></a> had returned to him in this place; also of the
fifty riders who encountered him on landing and would fain have
seized him but failed and of the death of the horseman who was
slain by the horse. Hereat they pitched the pavilions upon that
spot and set up a throne for the King who after taking seat thereon
placed his son by his side and bade summon the fifty riders who
were brought into the presence——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting, and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Sultan took seat upon the throne and set his son by his side he
summoned the fifty riders, who were brought into the presence
and placed between his hands. Then he questioned them of their
case and their country and the cause of their coming to that stead
and they notified to him their native land and their Sovran and
the reason of their wandering; to wit, their headlong pursuit of
the stallion which had lasted for a term of ten days. Now when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_410">410</span>the Sultan understood their words and knew and was certified
concerning their King and their country, he robed them with
honourable robes<a id="r548"></a><a href="#f548" class="c012"><sup>[548]</sup></a> and said to them, “Walláhi! had I known that
the stallion would have submitted to you and would have obeyed
you I should have delivered him up to you, but I feared for any
that durst approach him, barring his master. Now, however, do ye
depart and salam to your Sovran and say him:—By Allah, if the
stallion thou sawest wandering the waste befitted the use of thee
I had sent him in free gift.” With this fair message the men
farewelled him and fared from him and they ceased not faring until
they returned to their liege lord and reported to him all that had
betided them; that is, how the owner of the stallion had appeared
and proved to be a King who (they added) “hath sent his salam
to thee saying it was his desire to despatch the horse but none
availed to manage him save himself and his son.” And when the
Ruler heard these words, he returned thanks to the Sovran for the
grace of his goodness, and returned forthright to his own land.
Meanwhile the Sultan who was owner of the stallion presented the
captured ship to those who had captured her, and taking his son
turned towards his capital, and they marched without stay or
delay until they reached it. Hereupon the Chamberlains and the
Nabobs and the high Officers and the townsfolk came forth to
<span class="pageno" id="Page_411">411</span>meet and greet their Ruler and rejoiced in his safety and that of
his son, and they adorned the city for three days and all were in
high mirth and merriment until what time the Sultan had settled
down at home. Such was his case; but as regards the Khwajah
and his daughter, when they had let load their loads they quitted
the cavern and set forth, making for their country and patrial
stead, and they ceased not forcing their marches for a term of ten
days. But on the eleventh they encountered fiery heat beginning
from mid-forenoon; and, as the place was grassy ground and overgrown
with greenery, they alighted from their beasts and bade pitch
two pavilions, one for the daughter and the other for her father and
his folk, that it might shade them and shelter them from the excessive
sultriness. Now when it was mid-afternoon behold, the damsel
was seized with the birth-pains and the pangs of child-bearing, but
Allah Almighty made delivery right easy to her and presently she
became the mother of a man-child—Glory be to God who
fashioned him and perfected what He had fashioned in the
creation of that babe!<a id="r549"></a><a href="#f549" class="c012"><sup>[549]</sup></a> So his mother cut his navel-string and,
rolling it up in one of her shifts, kept careful guard over it.<a id="r550"></a><a href="#f550" class="c012"><sup>[550]</sup></a> And
presently her father entered to look upon her, and finding that she
<span class="pageno" id="Page_412">412</span>had been delivered was grieved with exceeding grief and the
world was straitened before his face, and unknowing what to do
he said to himself, “Had we reached our homes and that babe
appeared with the damsel, our honour had been smirched and men
had blamed us saying:—The Khwajah’s daughter hath brought
forth in sin. So we cannot confront the world, and if we bear
with us this infant they will ask where is its father?” He
remained perplext and distraught, seeing no way of action, and
now he would say, “Let us slay the child,” and anon, “Let us
hide it;” and the while he was in that place his nature bespake
him with such promptings. But when morning came he had
determined upon abandoning the new-born and not carrying it
further, so quoth he to his daughter, “Hearken unto whatso I shall
say thee.” Quoth she, “’Tis well!” and he continued, “If we
travel with this infant the tidings of us will spread through the
city and men will say, The Khwajah’s daughter hath been
debauched and hath borne a babe in bastardy; and our right way
(according to me) is that we leave it in this tent under charge of the
Lord and whoso shall come up to the little one shall take it with
the tent; moreover I will place under its head two hundred dinars
and any whose lot it is shall carry off the whole.” When the
damsel heard these words she found the matter grievous, but she
could return no reply. “What sayest thou?” asked he, and she
answered, “Whatso is right that do thou.” Hereupon he took a
purse<a id="r551"></a><a href="#f551" class="c012"><sup>[551]</sup></a> of two hundred gold pieces which he set under the child’s
head and left it in the tent. Then he loaded his loads and fared
forth, he and his daughter and his pages, and they ceased not
pushing their marches until they reached their own land and native
country and entered their home, where they were met by sundry
of their familiars coming forth to greet them. They settled down
in their quarters when the damsel forgathered with her mother
<span class="pageno" id="Page_413">413</span>who threw her arms round her neck for exceeding affection to her
and asked her of her news; so she informed her concerning the
matter of the cavern and what was therein and how great was its
distance, but she told her naught of what had befallen her nor of
her pregnancy by the Prince nor of the babe she had abandoned.
The mother still supposed that she was a clean maid, yet she
noted the change in her state and complexion. Then the damsel
sought privacy in one of the chambers and wept until her gallbladder
was like to burst and said to herself, “Would Heaven I
knew whether Allah will re-unite me with the child and its father
the Prince!” and in this condition she remained for a while of
time. On such wise it befel the Merchant and his daughter; but
as regards the son of the Sultan, when he had settled down in the
city of his sire he remembered the Khwajah’s daughter, and quoth
he to his father, “O my papa, my desire is to hunting and birding
and diversion.” Quoth the King, the better that Destiny might
be fulfilled, “’Tis well, O my son, but take with thee a suite.”
“I desire no more than five men in all,” said the other, and gat
himself ready for travel and, having farewelled his father, set forth
from the city——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Tenth Night,</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_414">414</span>the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Prince went forth
from his father with a train of five attendants and made for the
wilderness, and he conjoined the journeys of night and day;
withal he knew not whither he was going, and he chanced travel
over the same wilds and wolds and dales and stony leas. But as
regards the Merchant and his daughter, he went in to her one day of
the days and found her weeping and wailing, so he said to her,
“What causeth thee to shed tears, O my child?” and said she,
“How shall I not weep? indeed I must wail over my lot, and over the
promise wherewith Allah promised me.” Hereupon he exclaimed,
“O my daughter, be silent and Inshallah—God willing—I will
equip me for travel and will fare to the son of the King; and look
to it, for haply Allah Almighty our Lord may direct me to a
somewhat shall conduct me to the Prince’s city.” So saying he bade
his handmaidens and eunuchs make ready forthright a viaticum
sufficing for a full-told year himself and his following of pages
and eunuchs, and they did his bidding. After a few days they
prepared all he had required and he purposed to set out; then, he
loaded his loads and, farewelling his wife and daughter, went forth
seeking the city of the King’s son. He ceased not travelling for
a space of three months, when he found a meadow wide of sides
on the margin of a sweet-water lake, so he said to his slaves,
“Alight we here in this very place that we may take our rest.”
Accordingly, they dismounted and pitched a tent and furnisht
it for him, and he passed that night by the water-side, and all
enjoyed their repose. But as soon as morn ’gan show and shone
with sheeny glow, and the sun arose o’er the lands lying low, the
Khwajah designed to order a march for his slaves when suddenly
espying a dust-cloud towering in rear of them, they waited to see
what it might be, and after some two hours of the day it cleared
off and disclosed beneath it six riders and with them a bât-beast
carrying a load of provisions. These drew near the meadow where
<span class="pageno" id="Page_415">415</span>the Khwajah sat looking at them, and fear hereat entered into his
heart, and trembling fell upon his limbs<a id="r552"></a><a href="#f552" class="c012"><sup>[552]</sup></a> until he was assured that
they were but six men. So his mind was calmed. But when the
party drew near him he fixed his glance and made certain that the
men were headed by the King’s son whom he had met on his first
journey, and he marvelled indeed at the youth making for the
same place, and he strove to guess the cause of his coming with
only five followers and no more. Then he arose and accosted him
and salam’d and sat down in converse with him, being assured the
while that it was the same who had had doings with his daughter,
and that the child which she had borne in the tent and which they
abandoned was the son of this Prince, while the youth knew not
that the Khwajah was father to the damsel with whom he had
tarried in the cavern. So they fell to communing together for a
while until the Prince asked the Trader, “What is the cause of thy
coming hither?” and answered the other, “I have come seeking
thee and thy country, for I have a want which thou must fulfil
me;” presently adding, “And thou, whither art thou intending?”
Quoth the King’s son, “I am making for the cavern wherein the
handmaidens showed me much honour, for indeed I gave my word
that I would return to them after I had revisited my country and
had met my folk and my friends; and here I am coming back
to keep what plight and promise were between us.” Hereupon
the Merchant arose, and taking the Prince, retired with him to a
place of privacy where none could wot of them twain save Allah
Almighty. “Would Heaven I knew what may be in the thoughts of
this Khwájah!” said the Prince in his mind; but when both had
seated themselves at ease, the Merchant addressed the King’s son
in these words, “O my son, all things are foredoomed in the World
<span class="pageno" id="Page_416">416</span>of Secrets, and from fated lot is no flight. Now the end and aim
whereto thou designest in the cavern, verily they<a id="r553"></a><a href="#f553" class="c012"><sup>[553]</sup></a> left it for their
own land.” When the King’s son heard these words informing
him that his beloved had quitted her abode, he cried out with a
loud outcry for stress of what had betided him, and fell a-swoon
by cause that love of the damsel had mastered his heart and his
vitals hung to her. After a while he recovered and asked the
Khwajah, “Say me, be these words of thine soothfast or false?”
“Soothfast indeed,” answered the father, “but, O my child, be of
good cheer and eyes clear, for that thy wish is won”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
goodwill? It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director, the
right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the Khwajah
to the King’s son after he had revived, “O my child, be of good
cheer and eyes clear for that thy want is won and for thee the way
hath been short done and if thy heart be firm-fixed upon thy
beloved the heart of her is still firmer than thine and I am a
messenger from her who seek thee that I may unite you twain
Inshallah—an Allah please.” Asked the Prince, “And who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_417">417</span>mayest thou be to her, O my lord?” and answered the other
“I am her father and she is my daughter and hers is a marvel-tale,
I swear by the All-might of Him who made the Heavens and the
Earth.” Then he fell to recounting anent the Voice which came
to him on the night of her being conceived in her mother’s womb
and all that had since befallen her, keeping concealed<a id="r554"></a><a href="#f554" class="c012"><sup>[554]</sup></a> only the
matter of the babe which she had borne in the tent. But when
the Prince knew that the wayfarer was her sire who was travelling
to seek him, he rejoiced in the glad tidings of forgathering with the
damsel and on the morning of the second day all marched off
together and made for the Merchant’s city. And they stinted not
wayfaring and forcing their marches until they drew near it, and as
soon as they entered it, the Merchant, before going to his home,
led the Prince with him and sought the Kazi by whose aid the
marriage-tie, after due settlement of the dowry, might be tied
between him and the damsel. This done, he conducted him to a
place of concealment and presently went in to his daughter and her
mother who saluted him and asked him the news. Hereupon he
gave them to know that he had brought the King’s son and had
made ready to knot the knot of wedlock between him and her.
As soon as the damsel heard these tidings she fainted for excess of
her happiness, and when she revived her mother arose and prepared
her person and adorned her and made her don her most sumptuous
of dresses. And when night fell they led the bridegroom in
procession to her and the couple embraced and each threw arms
round the neck of other for exceeding desire and their embraces
lasted till dawn-tide.<a id="r555"></a><a href="#f555" class="c012"><sup>[555]</sup></a> After that the times waxed clear to them
and the days were serene until one chance night of the nights when
<span class="pageno" id="Page_418">418</span>the Prince was sitting beside his bride and conversing with her
concerning various matters when suddenly she fell to weeping and
wailing. He was consterned thereat and cried, “What causeth
thee cry, O dearling of my heart and light of mine eyes?” and
she, “How shall I not cry when they have parted me from my
boy, the life-blood of my liver!” “And thou, hast thou a babe?”
asked he and she answered, “Yes indeed, my child and thy child,
whom I conceived by thee while we abode in the cavern. But
when my father<a id="r556"></a><a href="#f556" class="c012"><sup>[556]</sup></a> took me therefrom and was leading me home
we encountered about midway a burning heat, so we halted and
pitched two tents for myself and my sire; then, as I sat within
mine the labour-pangs came upon me and I bare a babe as the
moon. But my parent feared to carry it with us lest our honour be
smirched by tittle-tattle, so we left the little one in the tent with
two hundred gold pieces under its head, that whoso might come
upon it and take it and tend it might therewith be repaid.” In
fine, she told her spouse the whole tale concerning her infant
and declared that she had no longer patience to be parted from
it. Her bridegroom consoled her and promised her with the
fairest promises that he would certainly set out and travel and
make search for the lost one amongst the lands, even though his
absence might endure through a whole year in the wilderness.
And lastly he said to her, “We will ask news and seek tidings of
him from all the wayfarers who wend by that same valley, and
certify ourselves of the information, nor will we return to thee save
with assured knowledge; for this child is the fruit of my loins and
I will never neglect him; no, never. Needs must I set forth and
fare to those parts and search for my son.” Such was their case;
but as regards the babe which had been abandoned (as we have
noticed), he lay alone for the first day and yet another when a
caravan appeared passing along that same road; and, as soon as they
<span class="pageno" id="Page_419">419</span>sighted the pavilion yet they saw none within, they drew near to
it and behold, they found a babe lying prostrate with his fingers
in his mouth and sucking thereat<a id="r557"></a><a href="#f557" class="c012"><sup>[557]</sup></a> and he was even as a slice of
the moon. So they approached him and took him up and found
under his head the purse, whereupon they carried him, not forgetting
the gold, and showed him to the Shaykh of the Cafilah<a id="r558"></a><a href="#f558" class="c012"><sup>[558]</sup></a> who
<span class="pageno" id="Page_420">420</span>cried, “Walláhi, our way is a blessed for that we have discovered
this child; and, inasmuch as I have no offspring, I will take him
and tend him and adopt him to son.” Now this caravan was from
the land of Al-Yaman and they had halted on that spot for a
night’s rest, so when it was morning they loaded and left it and
fared forwards and they ceased not wayfaring until they reached
their homes safe and sound. After returning all the Cafilah folk
dispersed, each to his own stead, but the Shaykh, who was employed
by government under the King of Al-Yaman, repaired to
his own house accompanied by the child which he had carefully
tended and salam’d to his wife. As soon as she saw the babe she
marvelled at his fashion and, sending for a wet-nurse, committed
him for suckling to her and set apart for her a place; and the
woman fell to tending him and cleaning him, and the house
prospered for the master and dame had charge of it<a id="r559"></a><a href="#f559" class="c012"><sup>[559]</sup></a> during the days
of suckling. And when the boy was weaned they fed him fairly<a id="r560"></a><a href="#f560" class="c012"><sup>[560]</sup></a>
and took sedulous charge of him, so he became accustomed to
bespeak the man with, “O my papa,” and the woman with, “O
my mamma,” believing the twain to be truly his parents. This
endured for some seven years when they brought him a Divine
to teach him at home, fearing lest he should fare forth the house;
nor would they at any time send him to school. So the tutor<a id="r561"></a><a href="#f561" class="c012"><sup>[561]</sup></a>
took him in hand and taught him polite letters and he became a
reader and a writer and well versed in all knowledge before he
reached his tenth year. Then his adopted father appointed for
him a horse that he might learn cavalarice and the shooting of
<span class="pageno" id="Page_421">421</span>shafts and firing of bullets at the butt,<a id="r562"></a><a href="#f562" class="c012"><sup>[562]</sup></a> and then brought for him a
complete rider that he might teach him all his art and when he
came to the age of fourteen he became a doughty knight and a
prow. Now one chance day of the days the youth purposed
going to the wild that he might hunt,——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth proposed going
forth to the wild that he might hunt, but his guardians feared for
him so that he availed not to fare forth. Grievous to him was it
that he could not obtain his liberty to set out a-chasing, and there
befel him much concern<a id="r563"></a><a href="#f563" class="c012"><sup>[563]</sup></a> and a burning thirst; so he lay him
down sore sick and troubled. Hereupon his father and mother
went in to him and, finding that he had taken to his pillow, they
mourned over him, and fearing lest he be afflicted by some disease
they asked him, “What is to do with thee and what calamity hath
befallen thee?” Answered he, “There is no help but that I go
<span class="pageno" id="Page_422">422</span>forth a-hunting in the wilderness.” Quoth they, “O our son, we
fear for thee,” and quoth he, “Fear not, for that all things be foredoomed
from Eternity and, if aught be written for me, ’twill come
to pass even although I were beside you; and the bye-word saith:—Profiteth
not Prudence against Predestination.” Hereat they
gave him permission, and upon the second day he rode forth to
the chase, but the wold and the wilds swallowed him up, and
when he would have returned he knew not the road, so he said to
himself, “Folk declare that affects are affected and footsteps are
sped to a life that is vile and divided daily bread.<a id="r564"></a><a href="#f564" class="c012"><sup>[564]</sup></a> If aught be
written to me fain must I fulfil it.” And whenever he hunted
down a gazelle, he cut its throat and broiled the meat over a fire
and nourished himself for a while of days and nights; but he was
lost in those wastes until he drew in sight of a city. This he
entered, but he had no money for food or for foraging his horse,
so he sold it willy nilly and, hiring a room in a Wakálah, lived by
expending its price till the money was spent. Then he cried,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great! The wise man doth even as the fool, but
All-might is to Allah.” So he went forth to solace himself in the
highways of the city, looking rightwards and leftwards, until he came
to the gateway of the King’s Palace, and when he glanced around
he saw written over it, “Dive not into the depths unless thou greed
for thyself and thy wants.”<a id="r565"></a><a href="#f565" class="c012"><sup>[565]</sup></a> So he said in his mind, “What is
the meaning of these words I see here inscribed?” Presently he
repaired for aid to a man in a shop and salam’d to him, and when
his salutation was returned enquired of him, “O my lord, what is
the meaning of this writ which is written over the Sultan’s gateway?”
The other replied, “O my son, whereof dost thou ask?
Verily the Sultan and all the Lords of his land are in sore cark
<span class="pageno" id="Page_423">423</span>and care for the affair of his daughter the Princess.” The youth
rejoined, “What is the matter with her and what hath befallen
her?” and the man retorted, “O my son, verily the Sultan hath a
daughter so fair that she seemeth cast in the very mould of beauty
and none in her day can excel her, but whoso is betrothed to her
and marrieth her and goeth in unto her the dawn never cometh
without his becoming a heap of poison, and no one wotteth
the business what it may be.” Hearing these words the youth
said to himself, “By Allah, the death of me were better than
this the life of me, but I have no dower to offer her.” Then he
asked the man, “O my uncle, whoso lacketh money and wisheth
to marry her, how shall he act?” “O my son,” answered the
other, “verily the Sultan demandeth nothing; nay, he expendeth
of his own wealth upon her.” The youth arose from beside the
man at that moment and, going in to the King, found him seated
on his throne; so he salam’d to him and prayed for him and
deprecated and kissed ground before him, and when the King
returned his salutation and welcomed him he cried, “O King of
the Age, ’tis my intent and design to be connected with thee
through the lady safe-guarded, thy daughter.” “By Allah, O
Youth,” said the Sultan, “I consent not for thine own sake that
thou wed her by cause that thou wilt be going wilfully to thy
death;” and hereupon he related to him all that befel each and
every who had married her and had gone in unto her. Quoth the
youth, “O King of the Age, indeed I rely upon the Lord, and if
I die I shall fare to Allah and His ruth and, if I live, ’tis well,
for that all things are from the Almighty.” Quoth the Sultan,
“O Youth, counsel appertaineth to Allah, for thou art her equal
in beauty;” and the other rejoined, “All things are by Fate and
man’s lot.” Hereupon the King summoned the Kazi and bade
tie the marriage-tie between the youth and his daughter; then he
went in to his Harem and apprised thereof her mother that she
might prepare the girl’s person for the coming night. But the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_424">424</span>youth departed from the Sultan’s presence perplext of heart and
distraught, unknowing what to do; and, as he walked about,
suddenly he met a man in years, clean of raiment and with signs
of probity evident; so he accosted him and said, “O my lord, ask
a blessing for me.” Said the Shaykh, “O my son, may our Lord
suffice thee against all would work thee woe and may He ever
forefend thee from thy foe.”<a id="r566"></a><a href="#f566" class="c012"><sup>[566]</sup></a> And the youth was gladdened by
the good omen of the Shaykh’s words. But when the Sultan had
sought his Harem he said, “By Allah, he who hath wedded the
damsel is a beautiful youth: oh the pity of it that he should die!
Indeed I dissuaded him, saying so-and-so shall befal thee, but
I could not deter him. Now by the rights of Him who raised the
firmament without basement, an  our Lord deign preserve this
Youth and he see the morn in safety, I will assuredly gift him and
share with him all my good, for that I have no male issue to
succeed me in the sovranty; and this one, if Allah Almighty
vouchsafe prolong his days, shall become my heir apparent and
inherit after me. Indeed I deem him to be a son of the Kings
who disguiseth himself, or some Youth of high degree who is
troubled about worldly goods and who sayeth in himself:—I will
take this damsel to wife that I may not die of want, for verily
I am ruined. I diverted him from wedding her, but it could not
be, and the more I deterred him with words manifold only the
more grew his desire and he cried:—I am content; thus speaking
after the fashion of one who longeth to perish. However, let him
meet his lot—either death-doom or deliverance from evil.” Now
when it was eventide the Sultan sent to summon his son-in-law
and, seating him beside the throne, fell to talking with him and
asking after his case; but he concealed his condition and said,
“Thy servant is such whereof ’tis spoken:—I fell from Heaven
and was received by Earth. Ask me not, O King of the Age, or
<span class="pageno" id="Page_425">425</span>of the root or of the branch, for one of the wise and ware hath
said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To tell my root and my name refrain; ✿ The root of the youth is what good he gain:<a id="r567"></a><a href="#f567" class="c012"><sup>[567]</sup></a></div>

<p class="c000">And folk are equal but in different degrees.<a id="r568"></a><a href="#f568" class="c012"><sup>[568]</sup></a> Now when the Sultan
heard these words, he wondered at his eloquence and sweetness of
speech; withal he marvelled that his son-in-law would not explain to
him from what land or from what folk he came. And the two ceased
not their converse until after the hour of night prayers, when the
Lords of the land had been dismissed; whereupon the Sultan bade
an eunuch take the youth and introduce him to the Princess. So he
arose from him and went with the slave, the King exclaiming the
while, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great: verily yonder young man wendeth wilfully
to his death.” Now when the bridegroom reached the apartment
of the Sultan’s daughter and entered to her——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying

and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth, when
entering to the Sultan’s daughter, exclaimed “Bismillah—in the
name of Allah—I place my trust upon Allah, and I have committed
mine affair unto Allah!” Then he went forwards and
found his bride seated upon her bedstead, and she was as a Hoard
newly loosed from its Talisman; while she on her part rose and
met him, and looked upon him and considered him until she was
certified of his being cast in beauty’s mould, nor had she ever seen
any like unto him. So she wept till the tears trickled adown her
cheeks and she said to herself, “Oh the pity of it! Never shall
my joy be fulfilled with this beautiful youth, than whom mine eyes
never fell upon one fairer.” Quoth he, “What causeth thee cry,
O my lady?” and quoth she, “I cry for the loss of my joys with
thee seeing that thou art to perish this very night; and I sue of
the Almighty and supplicate Him that my life may be thy ransom,
for by Allah ’tis a pity!” When he heard these words he presently
looked around and suddenly he sighted a magical Sword<a id="r569"></a><a href="#f569" class="c012"><sup>[569]</sup></a> hanging by
the belt against the wall: so he arose and hent it and threw it across
his shoulders; then, returning he took seat upon the couch beside
the Sultan’s daughter, withal his heart and his tongue never
neglected to recite the Names of Allah or to sue aidance from
the Prince of the Hallows<a id="r570"></a><a href="#f570" class="c012"><sup>[570]</sup></a> who alone can reconcile with the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_427">427</span>Almighty fiat the fates and affairs of God’s servants. This lasted
for an hour until the first third of the night, when suddenly were
heard the bellowings as of wind and rumblings of thunder, and the
bride, perceiving all the portents which had occurred to others,
increased in weeping and wailing. Then lo and behold! a wall
amiddlemost the chamber clave asunder, and there issued forth the
cleft a Basilisk<a id="r571"></a><a href="#f571" class="c012"><sup>[571]</sup></a> resembling a log of palm-tree, and he was blowing
like the storm-blast and his eyes were as cressets and he came on
wriggling and waving. But when the youth saw the monster he
sprang up forthright with stout heart that knew naught of startling
or affright, and cried out, “Protect me, O Chief and Lode-star of
the Hallows, for I have thrown myself upon thine honour and am
under thy safe-guard.” So saying and setting hand on brand he
advanced and confronted the portent swiftlier than an eye-glance,
raising his elbow till the blackness of the armpit appeared; and
he cried out with a loud outcry whereto the whole city re-echoed,
and which was audible even to the Sultan. Then he smote the
monster upon his neck<a id="r572"></a><a href="#f572" class="c012"><sup>[572]</sup></a> and caused head to fly from body for a
measure of some two spans. Hereupon the Basilisk fell dead, but
the youth was seized by a fainting-fit for the mighty stress of his
stroke, and the bride arose for the excess of her joy and threw
herself upon him and swooned away for a full-told hour. When
the couple recovered, the Princess fell to kissing his hands and feet
and wiping with her kerchief the sweat from his brow and saying
to him, “O my lord, and light of mine eyes, may none thy hand
<span class="pageno" id="Page_428">428</span>ever foreslow nor exult over thee any foe,” till he had recovered
his right senses and had regained his strength. Anon he arose,
and taking the Basilisk set it upon a large tray;<a id="r573"></a><a href="#f573" class="c012"><sup>[573]</sup></a> then, letting
bring a skinful of water he cleaned away the blood. After this
the youth and the King’s daughter sat down and gave each other
joy of their safety and straightway disappeared from them all traces
of distress. Presently the Bridegroom looked at his Bride and found
her like a pearl, so he caused her to laugh and disported with her and
excited her and she did on like wise and at last he threw her upon her
back and did away her maidenhead, whenas their gladness grew
and their pleasures were perfected and their joyance was enhanced
by the monster’s death. They ceased not, the twain of them
toying and enjoying themselves until it was well nigh dawn and
sleep overcame them and they slumbered. But the Sultan during
that night could relish nor lying down nor sitting up, and as soon
as he heard the shout he cried, “The Youth is indeed dead and
this world hath fled! There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.” About morning-tide he
prepared for him a shroud and mortuary perfumes, and all things
required, and despatched a party to dig a tomb for him who had
been slain by the side of his daughter, and he let make an iron
bier, after which he sent for the washers of the dead and summoned
them to his presence and lastly he awaited for his wife to seek her
daughter and bring him the tidings——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to survive?”

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Nineteenth Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sat until morning-tide expecting his wife to bring him tidings of
the youth that he might take him and bury him. But the Queenmother
repaired to her daughter’s apartment where she found the
door locked and bolted upon the couple; so she knocked for them
whilst her eyes were tear-stained and she was wailing over the
loss of her daughter’s love-liesse. Hereat the Princess awoke
and she arose and opened the door when behold, she found her
mother weeping so she asked her, “What caused thee shed tears,
O Mother mine, whilst my enjoyment hath been the completest?”
Asked she, “And what hath joyed you?” So the daughter led
her to the middlemost of the apartment where she found the
Basilisk (which was like the section of a palm-trunk) lying dead
upon a huge tray and she saw her son-in-law sleeping upon the
bedstead<a id="r574"></a><a href="#f574" class="c012"><sup>[574]</sup></a> and he was like a fragment of the moon on the
fourteenth night. The mother bowed head towards him and
kissed him upon the brow saying, “Verily and indeed thou
deservest safety!” Then she went forth from him lullilooing
aloud and bade all the handmaids raise the cry of joy<a id="r575"></a><a href="#f575" class="c012"><sup>[575]</sup></a> and the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_430">430</span>Palace was turned topsy-turvy with gladness and delight. When
the Sultan heard this he arose and asked “What may be the
news? Are we in grief or in gladness;” and so saying he went
forth when suddenly he was met by his wife in the highest delight
who took him and led him to the apartment of her daughter.
There he also espied the Basilisk stretched dead upon the tray
and the youth his son-in-law lying asleep upon the bedstead,
whereat from the stress of his joyance he fell to the floor in a
fainting-fit which lasted an hour or so. But when he revived he
cried, “Is this wake or rather is’t sleep?” after which he arose
and bade the musicians of his band beat the kettledrums and
blow the shawms and the trumps and he commanded adorn the
city; and the citizens did all his bidding. The decorations
remained during seven days in honour of the safety of the
Sultan’s son-in-law, and increased were their joys and fell from
them all annoys, and the Sultan took to distributing and giving
alms and largessing and making presents to the Fakirs and the
miserable and he robed his nobles with honourable robes and
fed the captives and the prisoners one and all<a id="r576"></a><a href="#f576" class="c012"><sup>[576]</sup></a>; and the naked
he clothed, and those anhungered he feasted in honour of his
daughter. Then said the Sultan, “By Allah, this youth deserveth
naught save that I make him my partner and share with him my
good, for he hath banished from us our dule and our dolours and
eke on account of himself and his own sake.” After this he made
over to him half of his realm and his riches and the Sultan would
rule one day and his son-in-law the other and their joys endured
for the space of a full-told year. Then the Sovran was seized
<span class="pageno" id="Page_431">431</span>of a sickness, so he bequeathed to his son-in-law all he had and
everything he owned; and but a little time elapsed before his
malady increased day by day until he fared to the ruth of
Almighty Allah and the youth sat in his stead as Sovran and
Sultan. Such was his case; but as regards the matter of his
sire, the King’s son of Al-’Irak, when he promised his wife that
he would certainly go forth and travel and search for their son,
he ceased not wending through the regions for a length of nights
and days until Destiny threw him into such-and-such a city; and
from the excess of what he had suffered of toil and travail he
tarried therein a time. Now the Shaykh of the Caravans (who had
found the babe in the tent and had taken him and had tended
and adopted him, and from whom the youth when grown to
man’s estate had disappeared on the hunting excursion and
returned not to his parents) also set out a-seeking him and fell
diligently to searching for tidings of him and roaming from place
to place. Presently he was cast by doom of Destiny into the
same city; and, as he found none to company with, he was
suddenly met on one of the highways by the youth’s true father
and the twain made acquaintance and became intimate until they
nighted and morning’d in the same stead; withal neither knew
what was his companion. But one night of the nights the two
sat down in talk and the true sire asked the adoptive father, “O
my brother, tell us the cause of thy going forth from thy country
and of thy coming hither?” Answered his comrade, “By Allah,
O my brother, my tale is a wondrous and mine adventure is a
marvellous.” Quoth he, “And how?” and quoth the other, “I
was Shaykh of the Cafilahs on various trading journeys, and
during one of them I passed by a way of the ways where I found
a pavilion pitched at a forking of the roads. So I made for it and
dismounted my party in that place and I glanced at the tent but
we found none therein, whereupon I went forwards and entered it
and saw a babe new-born strown upon his back and sucking his
<span class="pageno" id="Page_432">432</span>fingers.<a id="r577"></a><a href="#f577" class="c012"><sup>[577]</sup></a> So I raised him between my hands and came upon a
purse of two hundred dinars set under his head; and I took the
gold and carried it off together with the child.” But when his
comrade, the true father, heard this tale from him he said to
himself, “This matter must have been after such fashion,” and
he was certified that the foundling was his son, for that he had
heard the history told by the mother of the babe with the same
details essential and accidental. So he firmly believed<a id="r578"></a><a href="#f578" class="c012"><sup>[578]</sup></a> in these
words and rejoiced thereat, when his comrade continued, “And
after that, O my brother, I bore off that babe and having no
offspring I gave him to my wife who rejoiced therein and brought
him a wet-nurse to suckle him for the usual term. When he had
reached his sixth year I hired a Divine to read with him and teach
him writing and the art of penmanship<a id="r579"></a><a href="#f579" class="c012"><sup>[579]</sup></a>; and, as soon as he saw
ten years, I bought him a horse of the purest blood, whereon he
learnt cavalarice and the shooting of shafts and the firing of bullets
until he attained his fifteenth year. Presently one day of the days
he asked to go a-hunting in the wilderness, but we his parents (for
he still held me to be his father and my wife his mother) forbade
him in fear of accidents; whereupon he waxed sore sorrowful
and we allowed him leave to fare forth.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
<span class="pageno" id="Page_433">433</span>her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the adoptive
father pursued to his comrade, “So we permitted him to
hie a-hunting, and he farewelled us and went forth from us and
left us, whereat we fell to beweeping him; and inasmuch as until
this present he hath not returned to us, I have set out to seek
him and here am I in this place searching for traces of him.
Peradventure may Allah Almighty deign unite me with him and
gar me forgather with him; for, Walláhi! from the hour he
went from us sleep hath done us no good nor have we found
relish in food.” And when the speech was ended, quoth his
comrade, “O my brother, whenas he is not the son of thy loins
and he could prove himself perverse to thee, what must be the
condition in his regard of the father who begat him and the
mother who enwombed him?” He replied, “Theirs must be
cark and care and misery beyond even mine;” and the other
rejoined, “By Allah, O my brother, verily the relation thou hast
related anent this child proveth that he is, by God, my child and
of mine own seed, for in sooth his mother gave birth to him in that
stead where she left him being unable to carry him with her,
but now she beweepeth the loss of him through the nights and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_434">434</span>the days.” “O my brother,” quoth the adoptive father, “we
twain, I and thou, will indeed make public search and open
inquiry for him through the lands, and Allah Almighty shall
guide us himwards.” When morning came the pair went forth
together intending to journey from that city, but by doom of the
Decreer the Sultan on that very day set out to visit the gardens;
and, when the travellers heard tidings thereof, one said to the
other, “Let us stay and solace ourselves with a sight of the royal
suite and after we will wend our ways.” Said his comrade, “’Tis
well.” So they took their station to await the issuing forth of the
Sultan, who suddenly rode out amid his suite as the two stood
leaning beside the road and looking at the Sultan, when behold,
his glance fell upon the two men. He at once recognised the
father who had reared him, and when he gazed at the other
standing beside him his heart was opened to the love of him
albeit he weeted naught of their tie of blood nor believed that
any was his sire save the Shaykh who had adopted him. Accordingly,
after considering them he bade carry them both to the House
of Hospitality, so they led them thither and did his bidding.
Hereupon the twain said to themselves, “Wherefore hath the
Sultan made us his guests? Nor he knoweth us nor we know
him and needs must this have a cause.” But after leaving them
the King rode to the gardens where he tarried the whole day,
and when it was sunset he returned to his Palace, and at supper-tide
commanded the men be brought before him. They salam’d
to him and blessed him and he returned their salutations, and
bade them take seat at the trays whereat none other was present.
They obeyed his order much wondering thereat the while and
musing in their minds, “What condition is this?” They ate till
they were satisfied, after which the food-trays were removed and
they washed their hands and drank coffee and sherbets; then,
by command of the King, they sat down to converse when the
Sultan addressed them instead of the others, whereat they marvelled
<span class="pageno" id="Page_435">435</span>self-communing and saying, “What can be the cause?”
But as soon as all the attendants had been dismissed to their
quarters and no one remained save the Sultan and his guests
(three in all and no more), and it was the first third of the
night, the King asked them, “Which of you availeth to tell a tale
which shall be a joyance to our hearts?” The first to answer
him was the true father, who said:—Walláhi; O King of the Age,
there befel me an adventure which is one of the wonders of the
world, and ’tis this. I am son to a King of the Kings of the
earth who was wealthy of money and means, and who had the
goods of life beyond measure. He feared for my safety because
he had none other save myself, and one day of the days, when
I craved leave to go a-hunting in the wilderness, he refused me
in his anxiety for my safety. (Hereat, quoth the Sultan in himself,
“By Allah, the story of this man is like my history!”) So
quoth I:—O King, unless I fare forth to sport, verily I will slay
myself, and quoth my sire:—O my son, do thou go ride to the
chase, but leave us not long for the hearts of us two, I and thy
mother, will be engrossed by thee. Said I, “Hearing and obeying,”
and I went down to the stable to take a steed; and finding
a smaller stall wherein was a horse chained to four posts and, on
guard beside him two slaves who could never draw near him, I
approached him and fell to smoothing his coat. He remained
silent and still whilst I took his furniture and set it upon his
back, and girthed his saddle right tight and bridled him and
loosed him from the four posts, and during all this he never
started nor shied at me by reason of the Fate and Fortune writ
upon my forehead from the Secret World. Then I got him ready
and mounted him and went forth——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day, and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the man who
was bespeaking the Sultan pursued to him, “Then I mounted him
and rode him over the gravelly ground without the city when
behold, he snorted and snarked and shook his crest and started at
speed and galloped with me and bolted, swiftly as though he were
a bird in the firmament of heaven.” On this wise he fell to
recounting all that had befallen in the cave between him and the
Merchant’s daughter and what had betided him by decree of Allah;
how he had left her for his own land and how had her sire come
and carried her away; also in what manner she had been delivered
of a son by him on the road and had left her babe-child in the tent
hoping that someone might find him and take him and tend him;
and, lastly, how he had married the child’s mother and what was
the cause of his going forth and his coming to that place that he
might seek his son. Hereupon the Sultan turned to his adoptive
father whom hitherto he had believed to be his real parent saying,
“And thou, the other, dost thou know any tale like that told to us
by thy comrade?” So the Shaykh recounted to him the whole
history as hath before been set forth from incept to conclusion, nor
hid from him aught thereof. Then the Sultan declared himself to
his true sire, saying, “Thou art my father and there befel such
things and such,” after which said his adoptive parent, “Walláhi,
O my son, verily none is thy father save this one from whose loins
<span class="pageno" id="Page_437">437</span>thou art sprung, for I only found thee in the pavilion and took
thee and tended thee in my home. But this is thy very parent in
very deed.” Hereat all the three fell upon one another’s necks
and kissed one another and the Sultan cried, “Praise to Him who
hath united us after disunion!” and the others related to him
anent his maternal grandfather how he was a Merchant, and
concerning his paternal grandsire how he was a Monarch. Anon
each of the two was ordered to revisit his own country and convey
his consort and his children; and the twain disappeared for the
space of a year and a month and at length returned to the young
King. Hereupon he set apart for them palaces and settled them
therein and they tarried with him until such time as there came to
them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies.</p>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_441">441</span>It is related that there was a man who had a grown-up son, but
the youth was a ne’er-do-well,<a id="r581"></a><a href="#f581" class="c012"><sup>[581]</sup></a> and whatever wife his sire
wedded, the son would devise him a device to lie with her and
have his wicked will of her, and he so managed the matter that
his father was forced to divorce her. Now the man once married
a bride beautiful exceedingly and, charging her beware of his son,
jealously guarded her from him.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted

    <div>The Eight Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be not sleeping, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the father
applied himself to safe-guarding his wife and gave her a charge
warning her with threats against his son and saying, “Whenas I
wed ever a woman, yonder youth by his cunning manageth to have
<span class="pageno" id="Page_442">442</span>his wicked will of her.” Quoth she, “O Man, what be these words
thou speakest? This thy son is a dog, nor hath he power to do
with me aught, and I am a lady amongst women.” Quoth he,
“Indeed I but charge thee to have a care of thyself.<a id="r582"></a><a href="#f582" class="c012"><sup>[582]</sup></a> Haply I
may hie me forth to wayfare and he will lay some deep plot for
thee and work with thee as he wrought with others.” She
replied, “O Man, hold thyself secure therefrom for an he bespeak
me with a single word I will slipper him with my papoosh;”<a id="r583"></a><a href="#f583" class="c012"><sup>[583]</sup></a> and
he rejoined, “May safety be thine!” He cohabited with her for
a month till one day of the days when he was compelled to travel;
so he went in to his wife and cautioned her and was earnest with
her saying, “Have a guard of thyself from my son the debauchee
for ’tis a froward fellow, a thief, a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">misérable</span></i>, lest he come over thee
with some wile and have his will of thee.” Said she, “What
words are these? Thy son is a dog nor hath he any power over
me in aught whereof thou talkest, and if he bespeak me with one
injurious word, I will slipper him soundly with my foot-gear.”<a id="r584"></a><a href="#f584" class="c012"><sup>[584]</sup></a>
He rejoined, “If thou happen to need aught<a id="r585"></a><a href="#f585" class="c012"><sup>[585]</sup></a> never even mention
it to him;” and she, “Hearkening and obedience.” So he farewelled
her and fared forth wholly intent upon his wayfare. Now
when he was far enough from the town the youth came to the
grass-widow but would not address a single word to her, albeit
fire was lighted in his heart by reason of her being so beautiful.
Accordingly he contrived a wile. It happened to be summer-tide
so he went<a id="r586"></a><a href="#f586" class="c012"><sup>[586]</sup></a> to the house and repaired to the terrace-roof, and there
he raised his clothes from his sitting-place and exposed his backside
<span class="pageno" id="Page_443">443</span>stark naked to the cooling breeze; then he leant forwards
propped on either elbow and, spreading his hands upon the ground,
perked up<a id="r587"></a><a href="#f587" class="c012"><sup>[587]</sup></a> his bottom. His stepmother looked at him and marvelling
much said in her mind, “Would Heaven I knew of this
froward youth what may be his object!”<a id="r588"></a><a href="#f588" class="c012"><sup>[588]</sup></a> However he never
looked at her nor ever turned towards her but he abode quiet in the
posture he had chosen. She stared hard at him and at last could
no longer refrain from asking him, “Wherefore dost thou on this
wise?” He answered, “And why not? I am doing that shall
benefit me in the future, but what that is I will never tell thee; no
never.” She repeated her question again and again, and at last he
replied, “I do thus when ’tis summer-tide and a something of
caloric entereth my belly through my backside and when ’tis winter
the same cometh forth and warmeth my body; and in the cool
season I do the same and the frigoric cometh forth in the dog-days
and keepeth me in heats like these, fresh and comfortable.<a id="r589"></a><a href="#f589" class="c012"><sup>[589]</sup></a>” She
asked, “An I do what thou doest, shall it be the same to me.”
and he answered, “Aye.” Herewith she came forward beside him
and raised her raiment from her behind till the half of her below
the waist was stark naked;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the grass-widow
came forward beside her stepson and raised her raiment
from her behind until the half of her below the waist was stark
naked; and she did even as her husband’s son had done, and
perked up her buttocks, leaning heavily upon her knees and
elbows. Now when she acted on this wise the youth addressed
her saying, “Thou canst not do it aright.” “How so?”
“Because the wind passing in through the postern passeth out
through thy portal, thy solution of continuity.” “Then how shall
I do?” “Stopper thy slit wherethrough the air passeth.” “How
shall I stopper it?” “An thou stopper it not thy toil will be in
vain.” “Dost thou know how to stopper it?” “Indeed I do!”
“Then rise up and stopper it.” Hearing these words he arose,
because indeed he greeded for her, and came up behind her as she
rested upon her elbows and knees and hending in hand his prickle
nailed it into her coynte and did manly devoir. And after having
his will of her he said, “Thou hast now done thy best for me
and thy belly is filled full of the warm breeze.” On this wise he
continued every day, enjoying the wife of his father for some time
during his wayfare, till the traveller returned home, and on his
entering the house the bride rose and greeted him and said,
“Thou hast been absent overlong!”<a id="r590"></a><a href="#f590" class="c012"><sup>[590]</sup></a> The man sat with her
<span class="pageno" id="Page_445">445</span>awhile and presently asked of her case for that he was fearful of
his son; so she answered, “I am hale and hearty!” “Did my
son ask thee of aught?” “Nay, he asked me not, nor did he
ever address me: withal, O Man, he hath admirable and excellent
expedients and indeed he is deeply versed in natural philosophy.”
“What expedients and what natural philosophy?” “He tucketh
up his dress and exposeth his backside to the breeze which now
passeth into his belly and benefiteth him throughout the cold
season, and in winter he doeth exactly what he did in summer with
effect as beneficial. And I also have done as he did.” Now when
the husband heard these her words he knew that the youth had
practised upon her and had enjoyed his desire of her; so he asked
her, “And what was it thou diddest?” She answered, “I did
even as he did. However the breeze would not at first enter into
my belly for whatever passed through the back postern passed out
of the front portal, and the youth said to me:—Stopper up thy
solution of continuity. I asked him, Dost thou know how to
stopper it? and he answered, Indeed I do! Then he arose and
blocked it with his prickle; and every day I continued to do likewise
and he to stopper up the peccant part with the wherewithal
he hath.” All this was said to the husband who listened with his
head bowed groundwards; but presently he raised it and cried,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great;” and suddenly as they were speaking on
that subject the youth came in to them——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting,
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
youth came in to his father and found his stepmother relating to
him all they had done whilst he was away and the man said to
him, “Wherefore, O youth, hast thou acted on such wise?” Said
the son, “What harm have I done? I only dammed the waterway
that the warm air might abide in her belly and comfort her in the
cold season.” So the father knew that his son had played this
trick in order to have his will of her. Hereat he flew into a fury<a id="r591"></a><a href="#f591" class="c012"><sup>[591]</sup></a>
and forthright divorced her, giving her the contingent dowry; and
she went her ways. Then the man said in his mind, “I shall never
get the better of this boy until I marry two wives and ever keep
them each with other, so that he may not cozen the twain.” Now
after a couple of weeks he espoused a fair woman fairer than his
former and during the next month he wived with a second and
cohabited with the two brides. Then quoth the youth in his
mind, “My papa hath wedded two perfect beauties and here am I
abiding in single blessedness. By Allah, there is no help but that
I play a prank upon both of them!” Then he fell to seeking a
contrivance but he could not hit upon aught for that whenever
he entered the house he found his two step-mothers sitting
together and thus he could not avail to address either. But his
father never fared forth from home or returned to it without
warning his wives and saying, “Have a care of yourselves against
that son of mine. He is a whoremonger and he hath made my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_447">447</span>life distraught, for whenever I take to myself a wife he serveth
some sleight upon her; then he laugheth at her and so manageth
that I must divorce her.” At such times the two wives would cry,
“Walláhi, an he come near us and ask us of amorous mercy we
will slap him with our slippers.” Still the man would insist,
saying, “Be ye on your guard against him,” and they would reply,
“We are ever on our guard.” Now one day the women said to
him, “O man, our wheat is finished,” and said he, “Be ye
watchful while I fare to the Bazar in our market-town which lieth
hard by and fetch you the corn.” So he left them and made for
the town,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
father had gone forth and was making for the market-town, his
son happened to meet him, and the two wives went up to the
terrace wishing to see if their husband be gone or not. Now by
the decree of the Decreer the man had in some carelessness
forgotten his papooshes, so he turned to the youth who was
following him and said, “O my son, go back and bring me my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_448">448</span>shoes.” The women still stood looking, and the youth returned
in mighty haste and hurry till he stood under the terrace, when he
looked up and said, “My father hath just now charged me with a
charge saying:—Do thou go sleep with my wives, the twain of
them, and have each of them once.” They replied, “What, O
dog, O accursed, thy father bespake thee on this wise? By Allah,
indeed thou liest, O hog, O ill-omened wight.” “Walláhi,” he
rejoined, “I lie not!” So he walked back till he was near his
father when he shouted his loudest so as to be heard by both
parties, “O my papa, O my papa, one of them or the two of
them? One of them or the two of them?” The father shouted
in reply, “The two, the two! Allah disappoint thee: did I say
one of them or the two of them?” So the youth returned to
his father’s wives and cried, “Ye have heard what my papa said.
I asked him within your hearing:—One of them or the two of
them? and ye heard him say:—Both, both.” Now the man was
speaking of his slippers, to wit, the pair; but the women understood
that his saying, “the two of them” referred to his wives.
So one turned to her sister spouse and said, “So it is,<a id="r592"></a><a href="#f592" class="c012"><sup>[592]</sup></a> our ears
heard it and the youth hath on no wise lied: let him lie with me
once and once with thee even as his father bade him.” Both were
satisfied herewith; but meanwhile the son stole quietly into the
house and found his father’s papooshes: then he caught him up
on the road and gave them to him and the man went his ways.
Presently the youth returned to the house and taking one of his
father’s wives lay with her and enjoyed her and she also had her
joy of him; and when he had done all he wanted with her he
fared forth from her to the second wife in her chamber and
stretched himself beside her and toyed with her and futtered her.
She saw in the son a something she had not seen in the sire, so she
joyed in him and he joyed in her. Now when he had won his will
<span class="pageno" id="Page_449">449</span>of the twain and had left the house the women forgathered and
began talking and saying, “By Allah, this youth hath given us
both much amorous pleasure, far more than his father ever did;
but when our husband shall return let us keep our secret even
though he spake the words we heard: haply he may not brook too
much of this thing.” So as soon as the man came back with the
wheat he asked the women saying, “What befel you?” and they
answered, “O Man, art thou not ashamed to say to thy son:—Go
sleep with both thy father’s wives? ’Tis lucky that thou hast
escaped.” Quoth he, “Never said I aught of this”; and quoth
they, “But we heard thee cry:—The two of them.” He rejoined,
“Allah disappoint you: I forgot my papooshes and said to him,
Go fetch them. He cried out, One of them or the two of them?
and I replied, The two of them, meaning my shoes, not you.”
“And we,” said they, “when he spake to us such words slippered
him and turned him out and now he never cometh near us.”
“Right well have ye done,” he rejoined, “’tis a fulsome fellow.”
This was their case; but as regards the youth, he fell to watching
and dogging his father’s path, and whenever the man left the
house and went afar from it he would go in to the women who
rejoiced in his coming. Then he would lie with one, and when he
had won his will of her he would go to the sister-wife and tumble
her. This lasted for some time, until the women said each to
other, “What need when he cometh to us for each to receive him
separately in her room? Let us both be in one chamber and
when he visiteth us let us all three, we two and he, have mutual
joyance and let him pass from one to other.” And they agreed to
this condition, unknowing the decree of Allah which was preparing
to punish the twain for their abandoned wantonness.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
<span class="pageno" id="Page_450">450</span>I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me

and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the two
women agreed to partnership in iniquity with the youth their step-son.
Now on the next day the man went forth and left his house
for some pressing occasion and his son followed him till he saw
him far distant: then the youth repaired to the two wives and
found them both in one chamber. So he asked them, “Why doth
not each of you go to her own apartment?” and they answered,
“What use is there in that? Let us all be together and take our
joy, we and thou.” So he lay between them and began to toy with
them and tumble them; and roll over them and mount upon the
bubbies of one and thence change seat to the other’s breasts and
while so doing all were plunged in the sea of enjoyment.<a id="r593"></a><a href="#f593" class="c012"><sup>[593]</sup></a> But
they knew not what lurked for them in the hidden World of the
Future. Presently, lo and behold! the father returned and entered
the house when none of them expected him or was ware of him;
and he heard their play even before he went into the chamber.
Here he leant against a side-wall and privily viewed their proceedings
and the lewd state they were in; and he allowed time to
drag on and espied them at his ease, seeing his son mount the
breasts of one woman and then shift seat to the bubbies of his
other wife. After noting all this he fared quietly forth the house
<span class="pageno" id="Page_451">451</span>and sought the Wali complaining of the case; so the Chief of
Police took horse and repaired with him to his home where, when
the two went in, they found the three at the foulest play. The
Wali arrested them one and all and carried them with elbows
pinioned to his office. Here he made the youth over to the
Linkman who struck his neck, and as for the two women he bade
the executioner delay till nightfall and then take them and strangle
them and hide their corpses underground. And lastly he commanded
the public Crier go about all the city and cry:—“This

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_455">455</span>Whilome in Cairo-city there was a man famed as a Lack-tact
and another in Damascus was celebrated for the like quality. Each
had heard of his compeer and longed to forgather with him and
sundry folk said to the Syrian, “Verily the Lack-tact of Egypt is
sharper than thou and a cleverer physiognomist and more intelligent,
and more penetrating, and much better company; also he
excelleth thee in debate proving the superiority of his lack of tact.”
Whereto the Damascene would reply, “No, by Allah, I am more
tasteful in my lack of tact than yon Cairene;” but his people
ceased not to bespeak him on this wise until his heart was filled
full of their words; so one day of the days he cried, “By Allah,
there is no help for it but I fare for Cairo and forgather with her
Lack-tact.” Hereupon he journeyed from Damascus and ceased
not wayfaring till he reached Cairo. The time was about set of
sun and the first who met him on the road was a woman; so he
asked her concerning certain of the highways of the city and she
answered, “What a Lack-tact thou must be to put such a question
at such an hour! Whoso entereth a strange place in the morning
enquireth about its highways, but whoso entereth at eventide asketh
about its caravanserai<a id="r595"></a><a href="#f595" class="c012"><sup>[595]</sup></a> wherein he may night.” “Sooth thou
sayest,” rejoined he, “but my lack of tact hath weakened my wits.”
He then sought news of the Khans and they showed him one
<span class="pageno" id="Page_456">456</span>whereto he repaired and passed the night; and in the morning——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Lack-tact of
Damascus passed the night in the Wakálah and in the morning he
went forth and wandered about the highways of Cairo questing her
Lack-tact; and, when they informed him of his rival’s whereabouts,
he forgathered with him and was received with an honorable
reception and was welcomed and kindly entreated and comfortably
seated that the twain might talk over the news of the world.
Presently quoth the Lack-tact of Damascus to the Lack-tact of
Cairo, “I would that we two test each other’s quality by playing
a prank in turn; and whoso shall be preferred by the testimony of
the general, he shall lord it over his rival.” The Cairene asked,
“Which of us shall begin?” and the Damascene answered, “I,”
whereto the other rejoined, “Do whatso thou willest.” So the
Syrian went forth and hired him an ass which he drove out of the
city to a neighbouring clump of Ausaj-bushes<a id="r596"></a><a href="#f596" class="c012"><sup>[596]</sup></a> and other thorns
whereof he cut down a donkey-load, and setting the net-full upon
<span class="pageno" id="Page_457">457</span>the beast’s back returned to the city. He then made for the Báb
al-Nasr,<a id="r597"></a><a href="#f597" class="c012"><sup>[597]</sup></a> but he could not enter for the crowding of the folk
frequenting it and the Cairene was gladdened by his doings: so
the man stinted not standing there with his ass and load of thorns
till morn was near, when he lost his temper and urged his beast
close up to the gate. By so doing all the garments of the wayfarers
which were caught by the Ausaj-thorns were torn to rags
and tatters, and some of the people beat him and others buffetted
him and others shoved him about saying, “What a superior Lack-tact
thou art! Allah ruin thy natal realm! Thou hast torn folk’s
dress to rags and tatters with that load of thorns.” Still he drave
his donkey onwards albeit the people cried to him, “O man, withdraw
thee, the passengers are all jammed at the gate;” but he
would not retire and those present dealt him more blows and
abuse. Hereat he only cried, “Let me pass through!” and pushed
on whereby he obtained a severer beating. This lasted till mid-afternoon,
for he could on nowise enter by reason of the crush at
the Báb al-Nasr; but about sundown the crowd thinned and so he
drove on his ass and passed the gate. Then quoth to him the
Cairene, “What is this thou hast done? This is mere horseplay<a id="r598"></a><a href="#f598" class="c012"><sup>[598]</sup></a>
and not lack of tact.” Now on the morning of the next day the
Lack-tact of Cairo was required to play his prank even as the
Damascene had done; so he rose up and girded his loins and
tucked up his sleeves and took up a tray——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is

Cathedral-mosques and entered the lavatory,<a id="r600"></a><a href="#f600" class="c012"><sup>[600]</sup></a> around which were
some fifteen privies:<a id="r601"></a><a href="#f601" class="c012"><sup>[601]</sup></a> so he stood amiddlemost the floor considering
the folk as they entered the jakes to do their jobs in private
lest the bazar-people come upon them during their easement. And
all were sore pressed wanting to pass urine or to skite; so whenever
a man entered the place in a hurry he would draw the door to.
Then the Lack-tact of Cairo would pull the door open, and go in
to him carrying a posy of perfumed herbs, and would say, “Thy
favour!<a id="r602"></a><a href="#f602" class="c012"><sup>[602]</sup></a> O my brother,” and the man would shout out saying,
“Allah ruin thy natal realm, are we at skite or at feast?” whereat
all standing there would laugh at him. Suddenly one rushed into
<span class="pageno" id="Page_459">459</span>the lavatory sore pressed and hanging an arse<a id="r603"></a><a href="#f603" class="c012"><sup>[603]</sup></a> and crying aloud
in his grievous distress, “O Allah, O His Prophet, aid me!” for
that he feared to let fly in his bag-trousers. Then the Lack-tact
would accost him holding in hand his posy of perfumed herbs, and
softly saying, “Bismillah—take it, and give me thy favour;” and
the man would roar at the top of his voice, “Allah disappoint
thee! what a Lack-tact thou art: I am sore pressed; get thee
out.” And the further that man would fare away from him the
closer he would follow him saying, “Thy favour! Take it! Smell
it!” Now at that time all the cabinets of easement were full of
people, nor did one remain vacant, and the distressed man stood
there expecting someone to issue that he might enter; but in his
condition the delay was overlong——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you

they truly say that none can surpass or overcome the Cairene and

happened<a id="r605"></a><a href="#f605" class="c012"><sup>[605]</sup></a> that a Cairene went to borrow a donkey from another
man, a Damascene, wishing to ride it to a wedding, and when he
met his friend he saluted him and said, “Ho Such-an-one, lend me
thine ass for such a purpose.” Now when the owner of the animal
heard these words he smote hand upon hand and cried, “O
worshipper of Allah,<a id="r606"></a><a href="#f606" class="c012"><sup>[606]</sup></a> a little while ere thou camest to me, a man
urgently asked it of me and took it on loan: haddest thou been
somewhat earlier I would have lent it to thee. Verily I am put
to shame by thee as thou goest from me without thy need.” The
Egyptian said in his mind, “By Allah, this one speaketh sooth, and
had the donkey been in his house assuredly he would have lent it
to me.” But the owner of the animal said to himself, “Certainly
Such-an-one begged it of me, but the rest is a lie, for the beast is

</div>

<p class="c010"><span class="pageno" id="Page_465">465</span>I have a tale, O my lord the Kazi, which bewildereth the wits
and it is on this wise. By birth and origin I was the son of a
Khwájah, but my father owned much worldly wealth in money and
effects and vaiselle and rarities and so forth, besides of landed
estates and of fiefs and mortmains a store galore. And every
year when the ships of Al-Hind would arrive bringing Indian
goods and coffee from Al-Yaman the folk bought thereof one-fourth
of the whole and he three-fourths paying in ready cash
and hard money.<a id="r609"></a><a href="#f609" class="c012"><sup>[609]</sup></a> So his word was heard and his works were
preferred amongst the Traders and the Grandees and the Rulers.
Also he had controul<a id="r610"></a><a href="#f610" class="c012"><sup>[610]</sup></a> in counselling the Kings and he was held
in awe and obeyed by the merchants, one and all, who consulted
him in each and every of their affairs. This endured until one
year of the years when suddenly he fell sick and his sickness
grew upon him and gained mastery over his frame, so he sent for
me, saying, “Bring me my son.” Accordingly I went and entered
to him and found him changed of condition and nearing his last
gasp. But he turned to me and said, “O my son, I charge thee
with a charge which do thou not transgress nor contrary me in
whatso I shall declare to thee.” “What may that be?” asked I,
and he answered, “O my son, do thou never make oath in Allah’s
name, or falsely or truly, even although they fill the world for thee
<span class="pageno" id="Page_466">466</span>with wealth; but safeguard thy soul in this matter and gainsay it
not, nor give ear to aught other.” But when it was midnight the
Divine Mystery<a id="r611"></a><a href="#f611" class="c012"><sup>[611]</sup></a> left him and he died to the mercy of Allah
Almighty; so I buried him, expending much money upon his
funeral and graved him in a handsome tomb. He had left to me
wealth in abundance such as the pens could not compute, but
when a month or so had sped after his decease suddenly came to
me a party of folk, each and every claiming by way of debt from
me and my sire the sum of some five thousand dinars. “Where
be your written bond given by my father?” asked I; but they
answered, “There be no instrument and if thou believe us not make
oath by Allah.” Replied I saying, “Never will I swear at all,”
and paid them whatso they demanded; after which all who feared
not the Lord would come to me and say, “We have such-and-such
owing to us by thy parent;” and I would pay them off until
there remained to me of ready moneys a matter neither great nor
small. Hereupon I fell to selling off my landed estates——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and

<span class="pageno" id="Page_467">467</span>of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King thus
continued his relation to the Kazi:—I began selling off my landed
estates and fiefs and letting out my settlements of bequeathal<a id="r612"></a><a href="#f612" class="c012"><sup>[612]</sup></a>
until naught of all that remained by me; so I fell to vending the
house-gear and goods and carpets and pots and pans until I
owned nothing whatever, and my case waxed straitened and the
affair was grievous to me. Then quoth I to myself, “Allah’s
earth for Allah’s folk!” and, albeit I had a wife and two male
children, I left them and went forth under cover of the night a
wanderer about the world and unknowing where I should bring
myself to anchor. But suddenly O my lord the Kazi, I was
confronted by a man whose aspect bred awe, showing signs of
saintliness and garbed wholly in spotless white; so I accosted him
and kissed his hand, and he on seeing me said, “O my son, there
is no harm to thee!” presently adding,</p>

<p class="c000">After these words he took my hand and walked with me athwart
those wilds and wolds till such time as we made a city and entered
its gates. Here, however, we found no signs of creature-kind
nor any mark of Son of Adam, and when I sighted this my condition
changed and fear and affright entered my heart. But
presently the man turned to me and said, “Dread not nor be
startled, for that this city shall (Inshallah!) be thy portion, and
herein thou shalt become Sovran and Sultan.” Quoth I to
myself, “Walláhi, verily this man be Jinn-mad lacking wit and
<span class="pageno" id="Page_468">468</span>understanding! How shall I become King and Kaysar in such
place which is all ruins?” Then he turned to me yet another
time, saying, “Trust in Allah and gainsay Him not; for verily
shall come to thee joy out of that wherein thou wast of straitness
and annoy.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
man to the youth,<a id="r613"></a><a href="#f613" class="c012"><sup>[613]</sup></a> “Trust in Allah, for verily joy shall assuredly
come to thee from the Almighty.” “What joy?” quoth the
Khwajah’s son, “and indeed this city is a ruinous heap nor is
there indweller or habitant or any to attest God’s Unity.” But
the man ceased not going about the highways of the deserted
town with his companion till such time as he reached the Palace
of the Sultanate, and the twain entering therein found it with its
vases and its tapestry like a bride tricked out.<a id="r614"></a><a href="#f614" class="c012"><sup>[614]</sup></a> But the Spider
had tented therein, so both the wights fell to shaking and sweeping
for a three days’ space till they had cleaned away all the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_469">469</span>webbing and the dust of years; after which the elder man took the
younger and entered a closet. Herein he came upon a trap-door
which the two uplifted, when behold, they found a staircase
leading below; so they descended and walked till they ended at
a place with four open halls, one and all fulfilled with gold, and
amiddlemost thereof rose a jetting fount twenty ells long by fifteen
broad, and the whole basin was heaped up with glittering gems
and precious ores. When the merchant’s son saw this sight, he
was wildered in his wits and perplext in his thoughts, but the man
said to him, “O my son, all this hath become thine own good.”
After this the two replaced the trap-door as it was and quitted
that place; then the man took him and led him to another stead
concealed from the ken of man wherein he found arms and
armour and costly raiment; and the two stinted not wandering
about that palace until they reached the royal Throne-room.
Now when the Khwajah’s son looked upon it he waxed distraught
and fell a-fainting to the floor for awhile<a id="r615"></a><a href="#f615" class="c012"><sup>[615]</sup></a> and presently when
he revived he asked his companion, “O my lord, what be this?”
Answered he, “This be the throne of the Sultanate wherewith
the Almighty hath gifted thee;” and quoth the other, “By Allah,
O my lord, I believe that there is not in me or strength or long-suffering
to take seat upon yonder throne.” All this the King
(who erst was a merchant’s son) recounted to the Judge and
presently resumed<a id="r616"></a><a href="#f616" class="c012"><sup>[616]</sup></a>:—Then the man, O my lord, said to me,
“O my son, to all who shall come hither and seek thee be sure
thou distribute gifts and do alms-deeds; so the folk, hearing of
thy largesse, shall flock to thee and gather about thee, and as
often as one shall visit thee, exceed in honour and presents from
the treasure-store thou hast sighted and whose site thou weetest.”
And so speaking, O our lord the Kazi, he vanished from my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_470">470</span>view and I wist not an he had upflown to the firmament or had
dived into the depths of the earth, but one thing I knew; to wit,
that I was alone.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the merchant’s
son resumed to the Kazi:—Then the man vanisht from my view
and I wist no more thereof. So I seated me (and I all alone) in
that city for the first day and the second, but on the third behold,
I saw a crowd making for me from the city-suburbs and they were
seeking a site wherefrom they had somewhat to require. So I met
them and welcomed them and seated them, and soon I arose and
cooking for them food ate in their company and we nighted
together; and when it was morning I presented each and every
of them with an hundred dinars. These they accepted and fared
forth from me and on reaching their homes they recounted the
adventure to other folk who also flocked to me and received
presents like those who preceded them. Anon appeared to me a
multitude with their children and wives who said, “Billáhi,<a id="r617"></a><a href="#f617" class="c012"><sup>[617]</sup></a> O my
<span class="pageno" id="Page_471">471</span>lord, accept of us that we may settle beside thee and be under thy
protecting glance;” whereupon I ordered houses be given to
them. Moreover there was amongst them a comely youth who
showed signs of prosperity and him I made my assessor; so we
two, I and he, would converse together. The crowd thickened,
little by little, until the whilome ruined city became fulfilled of
habitants, when I commanded sundry of them that they go forth
and lay out gardens and orchards and plant tree-growths; and a
full-told year had not elapsed ere the city returned to its older estate
and waxed great as erst it was and I became therein Sovran
and Sultan. Such was the case of this King;<a id="r618"></a><a href="#f618" class="c012"><sup>[618]</sup></a> but as regards
the matter of his wife and his two sons, whenas he fared forth from
them he left them naught to eat and presently their case was
straitened and the twain set out, each in his own direction, and
overwandered the world and endured the buffets of life until their
semblance was changed for stress of toil and travail and transit
from region to region for a while of time. At last, by decree of
the Decreer, the elder was thrown by Eternal Fate into the very
town wherein was his sire and said to himself, “I will fare to the
King of this city and take from him somewhat.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the young man
went in to the Sultan and kissed ground before him and the King regarding
him felt his heart yearn himwards and said, “What wantest
thou, O youth?” “My design is service with thee,” said the other;
and the King rejoined, “Then welcome to thee!” So he abode in his
employ for a term of four months until he became like unto a
Mameluke<a id="r619"></a><a href="#f619" class="c012"><sup>[619]</sup></a> and his first case was changed: the Sultan also drew
him near and fell to consulting him in sundry matters the which
proved propitious, so quoth the King, “By Allah, this young man
meriteth naught less than to become my Wazir,” and accordingly
made him his Minister of the Right. In his new degree he became
as another liege lord<a id="r620"></a><a href="#f620" class="c012"><sup>[620]</sup></a> and his word was heard, so the land was
opened up by his hand and year by year he derived from it corvées
and taxes, nor did he cease to be Chief Councillor under the right
hand of the King. Meanwhile his brother who was the younger
stinted not faring from land to land until he was met by a party of
wayfarers that said to him, “O youth, verily the Sultan who ruleth
in such a capital is a liberal lord, loving the poor and paupers; so do
thou seek him and haply shall he show himself bounteous to thee.”
Quoth he, “I know not the city,” and quoth they, “We will lead
thee thereto for we purpose to go by his town.” So they took him
and he accompanied them until they reached the city when he
farewelled them and entered the gates. After solacing himself
with the sights he passed that night in the Wakálah and as soon
as it was morning he fared forth to serve for somewhat wherewith
he might nourish himself,<a id="r621"></a><a href="#f621" class="c012"><sup>[621]</sup></a> and it was his lot and the doom of the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_473">473</span>Decreer that the Sultan, who had ridden forth to seek his pleasure
in the gardens, met him upon the highway. The King’s glance
fell upon the youth and he was certified of his being a stranger
and a wanderer for that his clothes were old and worn, so he thrust
hand into pouch and passed to him a few gold pieces which the
other accepted right thankfully and blessed the giver and enlarged
his benediction with eloquent tongue and the sweetest speech. The
Sultan hearing this bade them bring to him the stranger, and
whenas they did his bidding he questioned him of his case and was
informed that he was a foreigner who had no friends in that stead;
whereupon the Sovran took him in and clothed him and entreated
him with kindness and liberality.<a id="r622"></a><a href="#f622" class="c012"><sup>[622]</sup></a> And after a time the Wazir of
the Right became kindly hearted unto him and took him into his
household where he fell to teaching him until the youth waxed
experienced in expression and right ready of reply and acquired
full knowledge of kingcraft. Presently quoth the Minister to the
Sultan, “O King of the Age, indeed this youth befitteth naught
save councillorship, so do thou make him Wazir of the Left.” The
King said, “With love,” and followed his advice; nor was it long
before his heart inclined to the hearts of his two Ministers and the
time waxed clear to him and the coming of these two youths
brought him serenity for a length of days and they also were in the
most joyous of life. But as regards their mother; when her sons
went forth from her, she abode alone——And Shahrazad was

who abode alone having been abandoned by her husband and
her children, cried, “I am here sitting sans my mate and sans
my sons; whatso shall I ever do?” and anon the case became
grievous to her and she set out to bewander the regions saying,
“Haply shall Allah reunite me with my children and my husband!”
And she stinted not passing from place to place and shifting from
site to site until she reached a town upon the margin of the main
and found a vessel in cargo and about to sail.<a id="r623"></a><a href="#f623" class="c012"><sup>[623]</sup></a> Now by the
decree of the Decreer the ship-captain having heard tell of the
Sultan’s generosity and open handedness had made ready for
him a present and was about to voyage therewith to his capital.
Learning this the woman said to him, “Allah upon thee, O
Captain, take me with thee;” and he did accordingly, setting
sail with a fair wind. He sped over the billows of that sea for a
space of forty days and throughout this time he kept all the
precepts and commandments of religion, as regards the woman,<a id="r624"></a><a href="#f624" class="c012"><sup>[624]</sup></a>
supplying her with meat and drink; nay more, he was wont to
address her, “O my mother.” And no sooner had they made the
<span class="pageno" id="Page_475">475</span>city than he landed and disembarked the present and loading it
upon porters’ backs took his way therewith to the Sovran and
continued faring until he entered the presence. The Sultan
accepted the gift and largessed him in return, and at even-tide
the skipper craved leave of return to his ship fearing lest any
harm befal vessel or passengers. So he said, “O King of the
Age, on board with me is a woman, but she is of goodly folk and
godly and I am apprehensive concerning her.” “Do thou night
here with us,” quoth the Sovran, “and I will despatch my two
Wazirs to keep guard over her until dawn shall break.” Quoth
the Captain, “Hearing and obeying,” and he sat with the Sultan,
who at night-fall commissioned his two Ministers and placed the
vessel under their charge and said, “Look ye well to your lives,
for an aught be lost from the ship I will cut off your heads.” So
they went down to her and took their seats the one on poop and
the other on prow until near midnight when both were seized by
drowsiness; and said each to other, “Sleep is upon us, let us sit
together<a id="r625"></a><a href="#f625" class="c012"><sup>[625]</sup></a> and talk.” Hereupon he who was afore returned to him
who was abaft the ship<a id="r626"></a><a href="#f626" class="c012"><sup>[626]</sup></a> and they sat side by side in converse,
while the woman in the cabin sat listening to them.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p class="c000">Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the two sons
forgathered in converse while the mother was listening and anon
quoth the elder to the younger, “Allah upon thee, O Wazir of the
Left, do thou relate to me whatso befel and betided thee in thy
time and what was the true cause of thy coming to this city; nor
conceal from me aught.” “By Allah, O Wazir of the Right,” quoth
the other, “my tale is wondrous and mine adventure marvellous
and were it paged upon paper the folk would talk thereanent race
after race.”<a id="r627"></a><a href="#f627" class="c012"><sup>[627]</sup></a> “And what may that be?” asked he, and the other
answered, “’Tis this. My sire was son to a mighty merchant who
had of moneys and goods and estates and such like what pens
may not compute and which intelligence may not comprehend.
Now this my grandsire was a man whose word was law and every
day he held a Divan wherein the traders craved his counsel about
taking and giving and selling and buying; and this endured until
what while a sickness attacked him and he sensed his end drawing
near. So he summoned his son and charged him and insisted
thereon as his last will and testament that he never and by no
means make oath in the name of Allah or truly or falsely.” Now
the younger brother had not ended his adventure before the elder
Wazir threw himself upon him and flinging his arms around his
neck cried, “Walláhi, thou art my brother by father and mother!”
and when the woman heard these words of the twain her wits
<span class="pageno" id="Page_477">477</span>wandered for joy, but she kept the matter hidden until morning.
The two Wazirs rejoiced in having found each of them a long-lost
brother and slumber fled their eyes till dawned the day when
the woman sent for the Captain and as soon as he appeared said
to him, “Thou broughtest two men to protect me but they caused
me only trouble and travail.” The man hearing these words
repaired forthright and reported them to the Sovran who waxed
madly wroth and bade summon his two Ministers and when they
stood between his hands asked them, “What was’t ye did in the
ship?” They answered, “By Allah, O King, there befel us
naught but every weal;” and each said, “I recognised this my
brother for indeed he is the son of the same parents,” whereat the
Sovran wondered and quoth he, “Laud to the Lord, indeed these
two Wazirs must have a strange story.” So he made them repeat
whatso they had said in the ship and they related to him their
adventure from beginning to end. Hereupon the King cried,
“By Allah, ye be certainly my sons,” when lo and behold! the
woman came forwards and repeated to him all that the Wazirs had
related whereby it was certified that she was the King’s lost wife
and their lost mother.<a id="r628"></a><a href="#f628" class="c012"><sup>[628]</sup></a> Hereupon they conducted her to the
Harem and all sat down to banquet and they led ever after the
most joyous of lives. All this the King related to the Judge and
finally said, “O our lord the Kazi, such-and-such and so-and-so
befel until Allah deigned reunite me with my children and my
wife.”</p>

<p class="c010"><em>CATALOGUE OF WORTLEY MONTAGUE
MANUSCRIPT CONTENTS.</em></p>

<p class="c000">I here proceed to offer a list of the tales in the Wortley Montague MS.
(Nos. 550–556), beginning with</p>

<h3 class="c013">VOL. I.,</h3>

<p class="c014">which contains 472 pages = 92 Nights. It is rudely written, with great carelessness
and frequent corrections, and there is a noted improvement in the
subsequent vols. which Scott would attribute to another transcriber. This,
however, I doubt: in vol. i. the scribe does not seem to have settled down to
his work. The MS. begins abruptly and without caligraphic decoration; nor
is there any red ink in vol. i. except for the terminal three words. The
topothesia is in the land of Sásán, in the Isles of Al-Hind and Al-Sind; the
elder King being called “Báz” and “Shár-báz” and the younger “Kahramán”
(p. 1, ll. 5–6), and in the same page (l. 10)  “Saharbán, King of Samarkand”;
while the Wazir’s daughters are “Shahrzádah” and “Dunyázádah” (p. 8).
The Introduction is like that of the Mac. Edit. (my text); but the dialogue
between the Wazir and his Daughter is shortened, and the “Tale of the
Merchant and his Wife,” including “The Bull and the Ass,” is omitted. Of
novelties we find few. When speaking of the Queen and Mas’úd the Negro
(called Sa’id in my text, p. 6) the author remarks:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Take no black to lover; pure musk tho’ he be ✿ Carrion-taint shall pierce to the nose of thee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And in the “Tale of the Trader and the Jinni” (MS. 1, 9: see my transl. 1, 25)
the ’Ifrit complains that the Merchant had thrown the date-stones without
exclaiming “Dastúr!”—by thy leave.</p>

<p class="c000">Scott, following “Oriental Collections,” ii. 34, supposes that the latter was
omitted by M. Galland “on account of its indecency, it being a very free detail
of the amours of an unfaithful wife.” The true cause was that it did not exist
in Galland’s Copy of The Nights (Zotenberg, Histoire d’ ’Alâ al-Dîn, p. 37).
Scott adds, “In this copy the Genie restores the Antelope, the Dogs and the
Mule to their pristine forms, which is not mentioned by Galland, on their
swearing to lead virtuous lives.”</p>

<p class="c000">Vol. i. ends with a page of scrawls, the work of some by-gone owner.</p>

<h3 class="c013">VOL. II.</h3>

<p class="c014">Contains 316 pages, and includes end of Night xcii. to Night clxvi. The MS.
is somewhat better written; the headings are in red ink and the verses are
duly divided. The whole volume is taken up by the Tale of Kamar al-Zamán
(1st), with the episodes of Al-Amjad and Al-As’ad, but lacking that of Ni’amah
and Naomi. In Galland Kamar al-Zaman begins with Night ccxi.: in my
translation with vol. iii. 212 and concludes in vol. iv. 29. This 2nd vol.
(called in colophon the 4th Juz) ends with the date 20th Sha’abán, A.H. 1177.</p>

<h3 class="c013">VOL. III.</h3>

<p class="c014">Contains 456 pages, extending from Night cccvi. (instead of Night clxvii.) to
cdxxv. and thus leaving an initial hiatus of 140 Nights (cxvi.–cccvi. C. de
Perceval, vol. viii. p. 14). Thus the third of the original eight volumes is lost.
On this subject Dr. White wrote to Scott, “One or two bundles of Arabic
manuscript, of the same size and handwriting as the second volume of the
Arabian Tales, were purchased at the sale by an agent for Mr. Beckford of
Fonthill, and I have no doubt whatever but that the part deficient in your copy
is to be found in his possession.” If such be the case, and everything seems to
prove it, this volume was not No. iii. but No. iv. The MS. begins abruptly
with the continuation of the tale. There is no list of contents, and at the end
are two unimportant “copies of verses” addressed to the reader, five couplets
rhyming in —ímu (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> ta’dimu) and two in —af (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> Salaf).</p>

<p class="c014">BY W. F. KIRBY.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE SULTAN OF AL-YAMAN AND HIS THREE SONS.</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 9.—The hippopotamus has also been observed, at the Zoological
Gardens, to scatter his dung in the manner described.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 13.—It is evident from the importance which the author attaches to
good birth and heredity, that he would hardly approve of the Socialistic
custom, so prevalent in the East, of raising men of low birth to important
offices of State.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>THE STORY OF THE THREE SHARPERS (pp. 17–35).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 19.—In quoting the titles of this and other tales of the Wortley Montague
MS., in which the word Ja’ídí frequently occurs, Scott often wrote “labourer”
or “artisan” instead of “sharper.” The term “sharper” is hardly applicable
here, for the fellows appear really to have possessed the knowledge to which
they laid claim. The “sharpers” in this story differ much from such impostors
as the Illiterate Schoolmaster (No. 93, vol. v. pp. 119–121) who escapes from his
dilemma by his ready wit, or from European pretenders of the type of Grimm’s
Dr. Knowall, who escapes from his difficulties by mere accident; or again from
our old friend Ma’aruf (No. 169) whose impudent pretensions and impostures
are aided by astounding good luck.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 23.—This test was similar to that given to Ma’aruf (vol. x. pp. 16, 17),
but there is nothing in the latter passage to show whether Ma’aruf had any
<span class="pageno" id="Page_506">506</span>real knowledge of gems, or not. In the present story, the incident of the worm
recals the well-known incident of Solomon ordering worms to pierce gems for
Bilkees, the Queen of Sheba.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 23.—English schoolboys sometimes play the “trussing game.” Two
boys have their wrists and ankles tied together, and their arms are passed over
their knees, and a stick thrust over the arms and under the knees, and they are
then placed opposite each other on the ground, and endeavour to turn each
other over with their toes.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 25 note.—Can the word Kashmar be a corruption of Kashmiri?</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF MOHAMMED, SULTAN OF CAIRO (pp. 37–49).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 37.—A few years ago, a travelling menagerie exhibited a pair of dog-faced
baboons in Dublin as “two monstrous gorillas!”</p>

<p class="c000">P. 40.—Ma’aruf’s jewel has been already referred to. The present incident
more resembles the demand made by the king and the wazir from Aladdin
and his mother, though that was far more extravagant.</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 42, 43.—A more terrible form of these wedding <em>disillusions</em>, is when the
bridegroom is entrapped into marriage by an evil magician, and wakes in the
morning to find the phantom of a murdered body in the place of his phantom
bride, and to be immediately charged with the crime. Compare the story of
Naerdan and Guzulbec (Caylus’ Oriental Tales; Weber, ii. pp. 632–637) and
that of Monia Emin (Gibb’s Story of Jewād, pp. 36, 75.) Compare my Appendix,
Nights, x. pp. 502, 508, 509.</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 44, 45.—There is a Western story (one of the latest versions of which
may be found in Moore’s Juvenile Poems under the title of “The Ring”) in
which a bridegroom on his wedding-day places the ring by accident on the
finger of a statue of Venus; the finger closes on it, and Venus afterwards
interposes continually between him and his bride, claiming him as her husband
on the strength of the ring. The unfortunate husband applies to a magician,
who sends him by night to a meeting of cross-roads, where a procession similar
to that described in the text passes by. He presents the magician’s letters to
the King (the devil in the mediæval versions of the story) who requires Venus
to surrender the ring, and with it her claim to the husband.</p>

<p class="c000">One of the most curious stories of these royal processions is perhaps the
Lithuanian (or rather Samoghitian) story of</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>THE KING OF THE RATS.</em><a id="r642"></a><a href="#f642" class="c012"><sup>[642]</sup></a></h4>

<p class="c014">Once upon a time a rich farmer lived in a village near Korzian, who was in
the habit of going into the wood late in the evening. One evening he went
back again into the wood very late, when he distinctly heard the name Zurkielis
shouted. He followed the voice, but could not discover from whence the sound
proceeded.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_507">507</span>On the next evening the farmer went again into the wood, and did not wait
long before he heard the cry repeated, but this time much louder and more distinctly.
On the third evening the farmer went again to the wood; but this
time on Valpurgis-night—the Witch’s Sabbath. Suddenly he saw a light
appear in the distance; then more lights shone out, and the light grew stronger
and stronger; and presently the farmer saw a strange procession advancing,
and passing by him. In front of the procession ran a great number of mice of
all sorts, each of whom carried a jewel in his mouth which shone brighter than
the sun. After these came a golden chariot, drawn by a lion, a bear, and two
wolves. The chariot shone like fire, and, instead of nails, it was studded with
dazzling jewels. In the chariot sat the King of the Rats and his consort, both
clad in golden raiment. The King of the Rats wore a golden crown on his
head, and his consort marshalled the procession. After the chariot followed a
vast procession of rats, each of whom carried a torch, and the sparks which
flew from the torches fell to the earth as jewels. Some of the rats were
shouting “Zurkielis” incessantly; and whenever a rat uttered this cry, a piece
of gold fell from his mouth. The procession was followed by a great number
of fantastic forms, which collected the gold from the ground, and put it into
large sacks. When the farmer saw this he also gathered together as much of
the gold and jewels as he could reach. Presently a cock crew, and everything
vanished. The farmer returned to his house, but the gold and jewels gave him
a very tangible proof that the adventure had not been a dream.</p>

<p class="c000">A year passed by, and on the next Valpurgis-night the farmer went back to
the wood, and everything happened as on the year before. The farmer became
immensely rich from the gold and jewels which he collected; and on the third
anniversary of the Valpurgis-night he did not go to the wood, but remained
quietly at home. He was quite rich enough, and he was afraid that some harm
might happen to him in the wood. But on the following morning a rat
appeared, and addressed him as follows: “You took the gold and jewels, but
this year you did not think it needful to pay our king and his consort the
honour due to them by appearing before them during the procession in the
wood; and henceforward it will go ill with you.”</p>

<p class="c000">Having thus spoken, the rat disappeared; but shortly afterwards such a
host of rats took up their abode in the farmer’s house that it was impossible for
him to defend himself against them. The rats gnawed everything in the house,
and whatever was brought into it. In time the farmer was reduced to beggary,
and died in wretchedness.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE SECOND LUNATIC (pp. 67–74).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">This is a variant of “Woman’s Craft” (No. 184 of our Table), or “Woman’s
Wiles,” (Supp. Nights, ii. pp. 135–148). Mr. L. C. Smithers tells me that an
English version of this story, based upon Langlès’ translation (Cf. Nights, x.
App., p. 498, sub “Sindbad the Sailor,”) appeared in the Literary Souvenir
for 1831, under the title of “Woman’s Wit.”</p>

<p class="c000">Pp. 69–76.—Concerning the Shikk and the Nesnás, Lane writes (1001
Nights, i., Introd. note 21): “The Shikk is another demoniacal creature,
<span class="pageno" id="Page_508">508</span>having the form of half a human being (like a man divided longitudinally);
and it is believed that the Nesnás is the offspring of a Shikk and of a human
being. The Shikk appears to travellers; and it was a demon of this kind who
killed, and was killed by, ’Alkamah, the son of Safwán, the son of Umeiyeh, of
whom it is well known that he was killed by a Jinnee. So says El-Kazweenee.</p>

<p class="c000">“The Nesnás (above-mentioned) is described as resembling half a human
being, having half a head, half a body, one arm, and one leg, with which it
hops with much agility; as being found in the woods of El-Yemen, and
being endowed with speech; ’but God,’ it is added, ’is all-knowing.’ (El-Kazweenee
in the khatimeh of his work). It is said that it is found in Hadramót
as well as El-Yemen; and that one was brought alive to El-Mutawekkil; it
resembled a man in form, excepting that it had but half a face, which was in
its breast, and a tail like that of a sheep. The people of Hadramót, it is
added, eat it; and its flesh is sweet. It is only generated in their country.
A man who went there asserted that he saw a captured Nesnás, which cried
out for mercy, conjuring him by God and by himself. (Mi-rát ez-Zemán). A
race of people whose head is in the breast is described as inhabiting an island
called Jábeh (supposed to be Java) in the Sea of El-Hind or India; and a kind
of Nesnás is also described as inhabiting the Island of Ráïj, in the Sea of Es-Seen,
or China, and having wings like those of the bat. (Ibn El-Wardee).”
Compare also an incident in the story of Janshah (Nights v. p. 333, and note)
and the description of the giant Haluka in Forbes’ translation of the Persian
Romance of Hatim Tai (p. 47): “In the course of an hour the giant was so
near as to be distinctly seen in shape like an immense dome. He had neither
hands nor feet, but a tremendous mouth, situated in the midst of his body.
He advanced with an evolving motion, and from his jaws issued volumes of
flame and clouds of smoke.” When his reflection was shown him in a mirror,
he burst with rage.</p>

<p class="c000">I may add that a long-tailed species of African monkey (<em>Cercopithecus
Pyrrhonotus</em>) is now known to naturalists as the Nisnas.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE BROKEN-BACKED SCHOOLMASTER (pp. 95–97).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">I once heard a tale of two Irishmen, one of whom lowered the other over a
cliff, probably in search of the nests of sea-fowl. Presently the man at the top
called out, “Hold hard while I spit on my hands,” so he loosed the rope for that
purpose, and his companion incontinently disappeared with it.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE SPLIT-MOUTHED SCHOOLMASTER (pp. 97–101).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">In Scott’s “Story of the Wry-mouthed Schoolmaster” (Arabian Nights,
vi. pp. 74–75) the schoolmaster crams a boiling egg into his mouth, which the
boy smashes.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_509">509</span>
  <h4 class="c019"><em>NIGHT ADVENTURE OF SULTAN MOHAMMED OF CAIRO (pp. 90–109).</em></h4>
</div>

<p class="c014">P. 103.—Scott (vi. p. 403) makes the proclamation read, “Whoever
presumes after the first watch of the night to have a lamp lighted in his house,
shall have his head struck off, his goods confiscated, his house razed to the
ground, and his women dishonoured.” A proclamation in such terms under the
circumstances (though not meant seriously) would be incredible, even in the
East.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE KAZI WHO BARE A BABE (pp. 167–185).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">In the Esthonian Kalevipoeg we read of two giants who lay down to sleep
on opposite sides of the table after eating a big supper of thick peas-soup. An
unfortunate man was hidden under the table, and the consequence was that he
was blown backwards and forwards between them all night.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF THE BHANG-EATER AND HIS WIFE (pp. 202–209).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">Selling a bull or a cow in the manner described is a familiar incident in
folk-lore; and in Rivière’s “Contes Populaires Kabyles” we find a variant of
the present story under the title of “L’Idiot et le Coucou.” In another form,
the cow or other article is exchanged for some worthless, or apparently worthless,
commodity, as in Jack and the Bean-stalk; Hans im Glück; or as in the
case of Moses in the Vicar of Wakefield. The incident of the fool finding a
treasure occurs in Cazotte’s story of Xailoun.<a id="r643"></a><a href="#f643" class="c012"><sup>[643]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>HOW DRUMMER ABU KASIM BECAME A KAZI (pp. 210–212).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">I have heard an anecdote of a man who was sued for the value of a bond
which he had given payable one day after the day of judgment. The judge
ruled, “This is the day of judgment, and I order that the bill must be paid
to-morrow!”</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE KAZI AND HIS SLIPPER (pp. 212–215).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">This story is well known in Europe, though not as forming part of The
Nights. Mr. W. A. Clouston informs me that it first appeared in Cardonne’s
“Mélanges de littérature orientale” (Paris, 1770), Cf. Nights x. App. pp. 509
and 512.</p>

<div>
  <span class="pageno" id="Page_510">510</span>
  <h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF THE THIRD LARRIKIN (pp. 296–297).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">Such mistakes must be very frequent. I remember once seeing a maid
stoop down with a jug in her hand, when she knocked her head against the
table. Someone sitting by thinking it was the jug, observed, “Never mind,
there’s nothing in it.”</p>

<p class="c000">Another time I was driving out in the country with a large party, and our
host got out to walk across to another point. Presently he was missed, and
they inquired, “Where is he?” There was a dog lying in the carriage, and
one of the party looked round, and not seeing the dog, responded, “Why,
where is the dog?”</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>TALE OF THE FISHERMAN AND HIS SON (pp. 314–329).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">The present story, though not very important in itself, is interesting as
combining some of the features of three distinct classes of folk-tales. One of
these is the anti-Jewish series, of which Grimm’s story of the Jew in the
Bramble-Bush is one of the most typical examples. According to these tales, any
villany is justifiable, if perpetrated on a Jew. We find traces of this feeling
even in Shakspeare, and to this day Shylock (notwithstanding the grievous
wrongs which he had suffered at the hands of Christians) rarely gets much
sympathy from modern readers, who quite overlook all the extenuating circumstances
in his case.<a id="r644"></a><a href="#f644" class="c012"><sup>[644]</sup></a> Nor do we always find the Jew famous for ’cuteness in
folk-tales. This phase of his reputation is comparatively modern, and in the
time of Horace, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credat Judæus</span>” was a Roman proverb, which means, freely
translated, “Nobody would be fool enough to believe it except a Jew.”</p>

<p class="c000">The present story combines the features of the anti-Jewish tales, the Alaeddin
series, and the Grateful Beasts series. (Compare Mr. W. A. Clouston’s
remarks on Aladdin, Supp. Nights, App. iii., pp. 564–581; and also his “Tales
and Popular Fictions.”)</p>

<p class="c000">In vol. 53 of the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (1884, pp. 24–39) I
find a Nicobar story which relates how Tiomberombi received a magic mirror
from a snake whose enemy he had killed. Its slaves obeyed all his orders if he
only put the key into the keyhole, but he was not allowed to open the mirror,
as he was too weak to face the spirits openly. He dwelt on an island, but when
a hostile fleet came against him, the gunners could not hit it, as the island
became invisible. The hostile chief sent an old woman to worm the secret out
of Tiomberombi’s wife; the mirror was stolen, and Tiomberombi and his wife
were carried off. On reaching land, Tiomberombi was thrown into prison, but
he persuaded the rats to fetch him the mirror.<a id="r645"></a><a href="#f645" class="c012"><sup>[645]</sup></a> He destroyed his enemies,
went home, and re-established himself on his island, warning his wife and
mother not to repeat what had happened, lest the island should sink. They
told the story while he was eating; the island sank into the sea, and they were
all drowned.</p>

  <h4 class="c019"><em>THE HISTORY OF ABU NIYYAH AND ABU NIYYATAYN (pp. 334–352).</em></h4>
</div>

<p class="c014">This story combines features which we find separately in Nos. 3b (ba);
162 and 198. The first story, the Envier and the Envied, is very common in
folk-lore, and has been sometimes used in modern fairy-tales. The reader
will remember the Tailor and the Shoemaker in Hans Christian Andersen’s
“Eventyr.” Frequently, as in the latter story, the good man, instead of
being thrown into a well, is blinded by the villain, and abandoned in a forest,
where he afterwards recovers his sight. One of the most curious forms of this
story is the Samoghitian</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>TRUTH AND INJUSTICE.</em><a id="r646"></a><a href="#f646" class="c012"><sup>[646]</sup></a></h4>

<p class="c014">Truth and Injustice lived in the same country, and one day they happened
to meet, and agreed to be friends. But as Injustice brought many people into
trouble, Truth declared that she would have no more to do with her, upon
which Injustice grew angry, and put out the eyes of Truth. Truth wandered
about for a long time at random, and at last she came to a walnut-tree, and climbed
up it to rest awhile in safety from wild beasts. During the night a wolf and
a mouse came to the foot of the tree, and held the following conversation. The
wolf began, “I am very comfortable in the land where I am now living, for
there are so many blind people there that I can steal almost any animal I like
without anybody seeing me. If the blind men knew that they had only to rub
their eyes with the moss which grows on the stones here in order to recover
their sight, I should soon get on badly with them.”</p>

<p class="c000">The mouse responded, “I live in a district where the people have no water,
and are obliged to fetch it from a great distance. When they are away from
home I can enjoy as much of their provisions as I like; indeed, I can heap
together as large a store as I please without being disturbed. If the people
knew that they had only to cut down a great oak tree, and a great lime tree which
grow near their houses, in order to find water, I should soon be badly off.”</p>

<p class="c000">As soon as the wolf and the mouse were gone, Truth came down from her
tree, and groped about until she found a moss-covered stone, when she rubbed
her eyes with the moss. She recovered her sight immediately, and then went
her way till she came to the country where most of the people where blind.
Truth demanded that the blind people should pay her a fixed sum of money,
when she would tell them of a remedy by which they could recover their sight.
The blind men gave her the money, and Truth supplied them with the remedy
which had cured herself.</p>

<p class="c000">After this, Truth proceeded further till she came to the district where the
people had no water. She told them that if they would give her a carriage and
horses, she would tell them where to find water. The people were glad to
agree to her proposal.</p>

<p class="c000"><span class="pageno" id="Page_512">512</span>When Truth had received the carriage and horses, she showed the people
the oak and the lime tree, which they felled by her directions, when water
immediately flowed from under the roots in great abundance.</p>

<p class="c000">As Truth drove away she met Injustice, who had fallen into poverty, and
was wandering from one country to another in rags. Truth knew her
immediately, and asked her to take a seat in her carriage. Injustice then
recognised her, and asked her how she had received the light of her eyes, and
how she had come by such a fine carriage. Truth told her everything, including
what she had heard from the wolf and the mouse. Injustice then persuaded
her to put out her eyes, for she wanted to be rich, and to have a fine carriage
too; and then Truth told her to descend. Truth herself drove away, and
seldom shows herself to men.</p>

<p class="c000">Injustice wandered about the country till she found the walnut tree, up
which she climbed. When evening came, the wolf and the mouse<a id="t512"></a> met under the
tree again to talk. Both were now in trouble, for the wolf could not steal an
animal without being seen and pursued by the people, and the mouse could no
longer eat meat or collect stores without being disturbed, for the people were no
longer obliged to leave their home for a long time to fetch water. Both the
wolf and the mouse suspected that some one had overheard their late conversation,
so they looked up in search of the listener, and discovered Injustice in the
tree. The animals supposed that it was she who had betrayed them, and said
in anger, “May our curse be upon you that you may remain for ever blind, for
you have deprived us of our means of living.”</p>

<p class="c000">After thus speaking, the animals ran away, but Injustice has ever
since remained blind, and does harm to everybody who chances to come
in her way.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF THE KINGS SON OF SIND AND THE LADY FATIMAH (pp. 1–18).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 5.—This mixture of seeds, &amp;c., is a very common incident in folk-tales.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 10.—Compare the well-known incident in John xviii. 1–11, which
passage, by the way, is considered to be an interpolation taken from the lost
Gospel of the Hebrews.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF THE LOVERS OF SYRIA (pp. 21–36).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 26.—Divination by the flight or song of birds is so universal that it is
ridiculous of Kreutzwald (the compiler of the Kalevipoeg) to quote the fact of
the son of Kalev applying to birds and beasts for advice as being intended
by the composers as a hint that he was deficient in intelligence.</p>

<p class="c000">In Bulwer Lytton’s story of the Fallen Star (Pilgrims of the Rhine,
ch. xix.) he makes the imposter Morven determine the succession to the
chieftainship by means of a trained hawk.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 36, <em>note 2</em>.—Scott may possibly refer to the tradition that the souls of
the dead are stored up in the trumpet of Israfil, when he speaks of the
“receiving angel.”</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>NIGHT ADVENTURE OF HARUN AL-RASHID AND THE YOUTH MANJAB (pp. 61–105).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 102.—In the Danish ballads we frequently find heroes appealing to
their mothers or nurses in cases of difficulty. Compare “Habor and Signild,”
and “Knight Stig’s Wedding,” in Prior’s Danish Ballads, i. p. 216 and ii. p. 339</p>

  <h4 class="c019"><em>HISTORY OF AL-HAJJAJ BIN YUSUF AND THE YOUNG SAYYID (pp. 39–60).</em></h4>
</div>

<p class="c014">P. 43, <em>note 1</em>.—I doubt if the story-teller intended to represent Al-Hajjaj as
ignorant. The story rather implies that he was merely catechising the youth,
in order to entangle him in his talk.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 46.—Compare the story of the Sandal-wood Merchant and the Sharpers
(Nights, vi. p. 206) in which the Merchant is required to drink up the sea [or
rather, perhaps, river], and requires his adversary to hold the mouth of the sea
for him with his hand.</p>

<p class="c000">P. 52, <em>note 3</em>.—It is well known that children should not be allowed to
sleep with aged persons, as the latter absorb their vitality.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>STORY OF THE DARWAYSH AND THE BARBER’S BOY AND THE GREEDY SULTAN (pp. 105–114).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">This story belongs to the large category known to students of folk-lore
as the Sage and his Pupil; and of this again there are three main groups:</p>

<p class="c000">1. Those in which (as in the present instance) the two remain on friendly
terms.</p>

<p class="c000">2. Those in which the sage is outwitted and destroyed by his pupil (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>,
Cazotte’s story of the Maugraby; or Spitta Bey’s tales, No. 1).</p>

<p class="c000">3. Those in which the pupil attempts to outwit or to destroy the sage, and
is himself outwitted or destroyed (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, The Lady’s Fifth Story, in Gibb’s
Forty Vezirs, pp. 76–80; and his App. B. note v., p. 413).</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>THE LOVES OF AL-HAYFA AND YUSUF (pp. 121–210.)</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 149, <em>note 1</em>.—I believe that a sudden attack of this kind is always
speedily fatal.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>THE GOODWIFE OF CAIRO AND HER FOUR GALLANTS (pp. 251–294).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">P. 255, <em>note</em>.—It may be worth while to note that Swedenborg asserts that
it is unlawful in Heaven for any person <em>to look at the back of the head</em> of
another, as by so doing he interrupts the divine influx. The foundation of
this idea is perhaps the desire to avoid mesmeric action upon the cerebellum.</p>

<h4 class="c019"><em>THE MERCHANT’S DAUGHTER, AND THE PRINCE OF AL-IRAK (pp. 371–437).</em></h4>

<p class="c014">Pp. 422–430.—The case of Tobias and Sara (Tobit, chaps, iii.–viii.) was
very similar: but in this instance the demon Asmodeus was driven away by
fumigating with the liver and heart of a fish.</p>

carpets, divans, cushions and kitchen utensils), to which the Badawi add “Girbahs”
(water-skins), querns, and pestles with mortars. These are usually carried by camels from
the bride’s house to the bridegroom’s: they are the wife’s property, and if divorced she
takes them away with her and the husband has no control over the married woman’s
capital, interest or gains. For other details see Lane M.E. chapt. vi. and Herklots

<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r43">43</a>.  </span>This masterful administrator of the Caliphate under the early Ommiades is noticed
in vols. iv. 3, and vii. 97. The succession to the Prophet began—as mostly happens in
the proceedings of elective governments, republics, and so forth—with the choice of a
nobody, “Abubakr the Veridical,” a Meccan merchant, whose chief claim was the
glamour of the Apostolate. A more notable personage, and seen under the same
artificial light, was “’Omar the Justiciary,” also a trader of Meccah, who was murdered
for an act of injustice. In Osman nepotism and corruption so prevailed, while distance
began to dim the Apostolic glories, that the blood-thirsty turbulence of the Arab was
aroused and caused the death of the third Caliph by what we should call in modern
phrase “lynching.” Ali succeeded, if indeed we can say that he succeeded at all, to
an already divided empire. He was the only one of the four who could be described
as a man of genius, and therefore he had a host of enemies: he was a poet, a sage,
a moralist and even a grammarian; brave as a lion, strong as a bull, a successful
and experienced captain, yet a complete failure as a King. A mere child in
mundane matters, he ever acted in a worldly sense as he should have avoided
acting, and hence, after a short and disastrous reign, he also was killed. His two sons,
Hasan and Husayn, inherited all the defects and few of the merits of their sire: Hasan
was a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pauvre diable</span></i>, whose chief characteristic was addiction to marriage, and by
poetical justice one of his wives murdered him. Husayn was of stronger mould, but he
fought against the impossible; for his rival was Mu’áwiyah, the Cavour of the Age, the
longest-headed man in Arabia, and against Yezíd, who, like Italy of the present day,
flourished and prospered by the artful game which the far-seeing politician, his father,
had bequeathed to his house—the Ommiade. The fourth of this dynasty, ’Abd al-Malik
bin Marwán, “the Father of Flies,” and his successor, Al-Walid, were happy in being
served thoroughly and unscrupulously by Al-Hajjáj, the ablest of lieutenants, whose
speciality it was to take in hand a revolted province, such as Al-Hijáz, Al-Irák, or
Khorásán, and to slaughter it into submission; besides deaths in battle he is computed
to have slain 120,000 men. He was an unflinching preacher of the Divine Right of
Kings and would observe that the Lord says, “Obey Allah an ye can” (conditional),
but as regards royal government “Hearing and obeying” (absolute); <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ergo</span></i>, all opposition
was to be cut down and uprooted. However, despite his most brilliant qualities, his
learning, his high and knightly sense of honour, his insight and his foresight (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> in
building Wásit), he won an immortality of infamy: he was hated by his contemporaries,
he is the subject of silly tale and offensive legend (<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i>, that he was born without anus,
which required opening with instruments, and he was suckled by Satan’s orders on
blood), and he is still execrated as the tyrant, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">per excellentiam</span></i>, and the oppressor of the
Holy Family—the children and grand-children of the Apostle.</p>

<p class="c000">The traditional hatred of Al-Hajjaj was envenomed by the accession of the Abbasides,
and this dynasty, the better to distinguish itself from the Ommiades, affected love for
the Holy Family, especially Ali and his descendants, and a fanatical hatred against
their oppressors. The following table from Ibn Khaldún (Introduct. xxii.) shows that
the Caliphs were cousins, which may account for their venomous family feud.</p>

it became the well-known technical term for a particular weight. “Zarrah,” according
to some glossarists, is the noun of unity of “Zarr,” the young ones of the ant, an antlet,
which is said to weigh the twelfth part of a “Kitmír” = pedicle of the date-fruit, or the
hundredth part of a grain of barley, or to have no weight at all. Hence “Mukhkh
al-Zarr,” the brains of the antlet, means a thing that does not exist or is impossible to be
found. According to others “Zarrah” is a particle of al-Habá, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> of the motes that
are seen dancing in the sunlight, called “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de" xml:lang="de">Sonnenstäubchen</span>” in German, and “atomo
solare” in Italian. Koran xxi. 48 and xxxi. 15 we find the expression “Mithkála

reader’s attention to the skilful portraiture of the model Moslem Minister, the unfortunate
Ja’afar. He is never described in the third person; but the simple dialogue
always sets him off as a wise, conciliatory, benevolent, loveable and man-loving
character, whose constant object is to temper the harshness and headstrong errors of a
despotic master as the Caliph is represented to be by way of showing his kingliness.
See vol. i, 102. [The MS. is certainly wrong here, but perhaps it can be righted a little.
It has: “Kad yakún Z R H ahad fí Mál jazíl wa harab al-Maz’ún,” etc., where
Sir Richard reads “zarra-hu” = he harmed, and Mazghún = the hated one, <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">i.e.</span></i> enemy. I
have a strong suspicion that in the original from which our scribe copied, the two words
were “zamin” and “al-Mazmún.” Zamin in the Arabic character would be <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">ضامن</span>.
The loop for the “m,” if made small, is easily overlooked; the curve of the “n,” if
badly traced, can as easily be mistaken for “r” and a big dot inside the “n” might
appear like a blotted “h” (<span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" dir="rtl" xml:lang="ar">ه</span>). Mazmún would become “Maz’ún” by simply turning the
“m” loop upwards instead of downwards, an error the converse of which is so frequently
committed in printed texts. Curiously enough the same error occurs p. 192 of the MS.,
where we shall find “na’’al” with two ’Ayns instead of “na’mal” with ’Ayn and Mim.
If this conjecture is correct the sense would be: Haply he may have stood security for
someone for much money, and the person for whom security was given, took to flight,
etc. For “zamin” with the acc. see Ibn Jubair ed. by Wright, 77, 2. I may say on
this occasion, that my impression of the Montague MS. is, that it is a blundering copy
of a valuable though perhaps indistinctly written original—<span class="sc">St.</span>]</p>

with scourges till the blood flowed in streams from their lacerated backs. At length the
punishment ceased, but the mortification of the Sultan did not end here, for all the gold
which the Dirveshe had transmuted returned to its original metals. Thus, by his unjust
credulity, was a weak Prince punished for his ungrateful folly. The barber and his son
also were not to be found, so that the sultan could gain no intelligence of the Dirveshe,

Arabs still retain our mediæval superstitions concerning precious stones, and of these
fancies I will quote a few. The ruby appeases thirst, strengthens cardiac action and
averts plague and “thunderbolts.” The diamond heals diseases, and is a specific
against epilepsy or the “possession” by evil spirits: this is also the speciality of the
emerald, which, moreover, cures ophthalmia and the stings of scorpions and bites of
venomous reptiles, blinding them if placed before their eyes. The turquoise is
peculiarly auspicious, abating fascination, strengthening the sight, and, if worn in a
ring, increasing the milk of nursing mothers: hence the blue beads hung as necklaces to
cattle. The topaz (being yellow) is a prophylactic against jaundice and bilious diseases.
The bloodstone when shown to men in rage causes their wrath to depart: it arrests
hemorrhage, heals toothache, preserves from bad luck, and is a pledge of long life and
happiness. The “cat’s-eye” nullifies Al-Ayn = malign influence by the look, and worn
in battle makes the wearer invisible to his foe. This is but a “fist-full out of a donkey-load,”
as the Persians say: the subject is a favourite with Eastern writers.</p>

ten girls) recited extempore verses before the caliph, but the subject of each was so
expressive of their wish to return to their beloved sovereign, and delivered in so affecting
a manner, that Mamoon, though delighted with their wit and beauty, sacrificed his own
pleasure to their feelings, and sent them back to Eusuff by the officer who carried the
edict, confirming him in his dominions, where the prince of Sind and the fair Aleefa

Throughout the Eastern world this idea prevails, and both Sir Moses Montefiore and
M. Cremieux were utterly at fault and certainly knew it when they declared that Europe

error, unless it be related to “Keb” with the Yá majhúl, which in the Appendix to the

<p class="c000">Such lore has been carefully cultivated by the “young person” with the able assistance of
the ancient dames of the household, of her juvenile companions and co-evals and especially
of the slave-girls. Moreover not a few Moslems, even Egyptians, the most lecherous
and salacious of men, in all ranks of life from prince to peasant take a pride in respecting
the maiden for a few nights after the wedding-feast extending, perhaps to a whole week
and sometimes more. A brutal haste is looked upon as “low”; and, as sensible men,
they provoke by fondling and toying Nature to speak ere proceeding to the final and
critical act. In England it is very different. I have heard of brides over thirty years
old who had not the slightest suspicion concerning what complaisance was expected of
them: out of <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvaise honte</span></i>, the besetting sin of the respectable classes, neither mother
nor father would venture to enlighten the elderly innocents. For a delicate girl to find
a man introducing himself into her bedroom and her bed, the shock must be severe and
the contact of hirsute breast and hairy limbs with a satiny skin is a strangeness which
must often breed loathing and disgust. Too frequently also, instead of showing the
utmost regard for virginal modesty and innocence (alias ignorance), the bridegroom will
not put a check upon his passions and precipitates matters with the rage of the bull,
<i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">ruentis in venerem</span></i>. Even after he hears “the cry” which, as the Arabs say, “must
be cried,” he has no mercy: the newly made woman lies quivering with mental agitation
and physical pain, which not a few describe as resembling the tearing out of a back-tooth,
and yet he insists upon repeating the operation, never supposing in his stupidity,
that time must pass before the patient can have any sensation of pleasure and before the
glories and delights of the sensual orgasm bathe her soul in bliss. Hence complaints,
dissatisfaction, disgust, mainly caused by the man’s fault, and hence not unfrequently a
permanent distaste for the act of carnal congress. All women are by no means equally
capable of such enjoyment, and not a few have become mothers of many children
without ever being or becoming thoroughly reconciled to it. Especially in the case of
highly nervous temperaments—and these seem to be increasing in the United States and
notably in New England—the fear of nine months’ pains and penalties makes the sex
averse to the “deed of kind.” The first child is perhaps welcomed, the second is an
unpleasant prospect and there is a firm resolve not to conceive a third. But such conjugal
chastity is incompatible, except in the case of “married saints,” with a <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon ménage</span></i>.
The husband, scandalised and offended by the rejection and refusal of the wife, will
seek a substitute more complaisant; and the spouse also may “by the decree of Destiny”
happen to meet the right man, the man for whom and for whom only every woman will
sweep the floor. And then adieu to prudence and virtue, honour and fair fame. For, I
repeat, it is the universal custom of civilized and Christian Europeans to plant their
womankind upon a pedestal exposed as butts to every possible temptation: and, if they
fall, as must often be expected, to assail them with obloquy and contempt for succumbing
to trials imposed upon them by the stronger and less sensitive sex. Far more
sensible and practical, by the side of these high idealists, shows the Moslem who guards
his jewel with jealous care and who, if his “honour,” despite every precaution, insist
upon disgracing him, draws the sabre and cuts her down with the general approbation
and applause of society.</p>

pulsations without strengthening them and depresses the heart-action with a calming and
soothing effect. Coffee, like alcohol, affects the circulation in the reverse way by exciting
it through the nervous system; and not a few authorities advise habitual smokers to end
the day and prepare for rest with a glass of spirits and water. It is to be desired that
the ignorants who write about “that filthy tobacco” would take the trouble to observe its
effects on a large scale, and not base the strongest and extremest opinions, as is the wont
of the Anglo-Saxon <em>Halb-bildung</em>, upon the narrowest and shakiest of vases. In Egypt,

lesson and, contrary to custom, the husband has the best of the affair. To prove that
my judgment is not too severe, let me quote the following passages from a well-known
and popular French novelist, translated by an English littérateur and published by a
respectable London firm.</p>

<p class="c000">In “A Ladies’ Man:” by Guy de Maupassant, we read:—</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Page 62.</em>—And the conversation, descending from elevated theories concerning love,
strayed into the flowery garden of polished blackguardism. It was the moment of
clever double meanings; veils raised by words, as petticoats are lifted by the wind;
tricks of language, cleverly disguised audacities; sentences which reveal nude images in
covered phrases, which cause the vision of all that may not be said to flit rapidly before
the eyes of the mind, and allow well-bred people the enjoyment of a kind of subtle and
mysterious love, a species of impure mental contact, due to the simultaneous evocations
of secret, shameful, and longed-for pleasures.</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Page 166.</em>—George and Madeleine amused themselves with watching all these couples,
the woman in summer toilette and the man darkly outlined beside her. It was a huge
flood of lovers flowing towards the Bois, beneath the starry and heated sky. No sound
was heard save the dull rumble of wheels. They kept passing by, two by two in each
vehicle, leaning back on the seat, clasped one against the other, lost in dreams of desire,
quivering with the anticipation of coming caresses. The warm shadow seemed full of
kisses. A sense of spreading lust rendered the air heavier and more suffocating. All
the couples, intoxicated with the same idea, the same ardour, shed a fever about them.</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Page 187.</em>—As soon as she was alone with George, she clasped him in her arms,
exclaiming: “Oh! my darling Pretty-boy, I love you more and more every day.”</p>

<p class="c000">The cab conveying them rocked like a ship.</p>

<p class="c000">“It is not so nice as our own room,” said she.</p>

<p class="c000">He answered; “Oh, no.” But he was thinking of Madame Waller.</p>

<p class="c000"><em>Page 198.</em>—He kissed her neck, her eyes, her lips with eagerness, without her being
able to avoid his furious caresses, and whilst repulsing him, whilst shrinking from his
mouth, she, despite herself, returned his kisses. All at once she ceased to struggle,
and, vanquished, resigned, allowed him to undress her. One by one he neatly and
rapidly stripped off the different articles of clothing with the light fingers of a lady’s
maid. She had snatched her bodice from his hands to hide her face in it, and remained
standing amidst the garments fallen at her feet. He seized her in his arms and bore
her towards the couch. Then she murmured in his ear in a broken voice, “I swear to

Clouston’s “Book of Noodles” (pp. 193–194) we find a man who is searching for

quoted from Campbell’s “Popular Tales of the West Highlands” (ii. 385–387), but it
lacks the canopic wit of the Arabo-Egyptian. I may note anent the anecdote of the
Gabies (p. 201), who proposed, in order to make the tall bride on horseback enter the
low village-gate, either to cut off her head or the legs of her steed, that precisely the
same tale is told by the biting wits of Damascus concerning the boobies of Halbún.
“Halbáún,” as these villagers call their ancient hamlet, is justly supposed to be the

<p class="c000">And here I cannot but notice the pitiful contrast (on the centenary of the poet’s nativity,
Jan. 22nd, ’88) between the land of his birth and that of his death. The gallant
Greeks honoured his memory with wreaths and panegyrics and laudatory articles,
declaring that they will never forget the anniversaries of his nativity and his decease.
The British Pharisee and Philistine, true to his miserable creed, ignored all the “real
Lord Byron”—his generosity, his devotion to his friends, his boundless charity, and his
enthusiasm for humanity. They exhaled their venom by carping at Byron’s poetry
(which was and is to Europe a greater boon than Shakspeare’s), by condemning his
morality (in its dirty sexual sense) and in prophesying for him speedy oblivion. Have
these men no shame in presence of the noble panegyric dedicated by the Prince of
German poets, Goethe, to his brother bard whom he welcomed as a prophet? Can they
not blush before Heine (the great German of the future), before Flaubert, Alfred de
Musset, Lamartine, Leopardi and a host of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese notables?
Whilst England will not forgive Byron for having separated from his unsympathetic wife,
the Literary society of Moscow celebrated his centenary with all honour; and Prof.
Nicholas Storojenko delivered a speech which has found an echo</p>

of 100 grammes in massive gold, hammer-wrought, and studded with gems, given only
to royalties; (2) the Knighthood, similar, but of 50 grammes, and without jewels,
intended for distinguished foreigners; (3) the Officer’s Star, silver-gilt, of 50 grammes;
and (4) the Companion’s, of pure silver, and the same weight. All are worn round the
neck save the last, which hangs upon the chest. This practice of gilding the medals

foe who would use it magically to injure the babe. The navel-string has few superstitions
in England. The lower classes mostly place over the wound a bit of cloth wherein
a hole has been burned, supposing that the carbon will heal the cut, and make it fast to
the babe by a “binder” or swathe round the body, as a preventative to “pot-belly.”
But throughout the East there are more observances. In India, on the birth of the babe,
the midwife demands something shining, as a rupee or piece of silver, and having
touched the navel-string therewith she divides it and appropriates the glittering substance,
under the pretence that the absence of the illuminating power of some such sparkling
object would prevent her seeing to operate. The knife with which the umbilical cord
has been cut is not used for common purposes but is left beside the puerpera until
the “Chilla” (fortieth day), when “Kajjal” (lamp-black), used by way of Kohl, is
collected on it and applied to the child’s eyelids. Whenever the babe is bathed or
taken out of the house the knife must be carried along with it; and when they are
brought in again the instrument is deposited in its former place near the mother.
Lastly, on the “Chilla”-day they must slaughter with the same blade a cock or a sheep
(Herklots, chapt. i. sec. 3). Equally quaint is the treatment of the navel-string in
Egypt; but Lane (M.E.) is too modest to give details.</p>

now commonly called “Sabbábah” = the reviler, where the same idea of pointing at with
contempt seems to prevail, and “Sháhid” = the witnessing, because it is raised in giving

<div class="footnote" id="f558">
<p class="c000"><span class="label"><a href="#r558">558</a>.  </span>I write “Cafilah” and not “Cafila” with the unjustifiable suppression of the final
“h” which is always made sensible in the pure pronunciation of the Badawi. The
malpractice has found favour chiefly through the advocacy of Dr. Redhouse, an eminent
Turkish scholar whose judgments must be received with great caution; and I would
quote on this subject the admirable remarks of my late lamented friend Dr. G. P. Badger
in “The Academy” of July 2, 1887. “Another noticeable default in the same category is
that, like Sale, Mr. Wherry frequently omits the terminal ’h’ in his transliteration
of Arabic. Thus he writes Sura, Amína, Fátima, Madína, Taháma; yet, inconsistently
enough, he gives the ’h’ in Allah, Khadijah, Kaabah, Makkah, and many other words.
This point deserves special notice, owing to Dr. Redhouse’s letter, published in ’The
Academy’ of November 22 last, in which he denounces as (’a very common European
error’) the addition of the ’h’ or ’final aspirate,’ in the English transliteration of
many Arabic words. Hence, as I read the eminent Orientalist’s criticism, when that
aspirate is not sounded in pronunciation he omits it, writing “Fátima,” not Fatimah,
lest, as I presume, the unwary reader may aspirate the ’h.’ But in our Bibles we find
such names as <em>Sarah</em>, <em>Hannah</em>, <em>Judah</em>, <em>Beulah</em>, <em>Moriah</em>, <em>Jehovah</em>, in the enunciation of
which no one thinks of sounding the last letter as an aspirate. I quite agree with Dr.
Redhouse that in the construct case the final <em>h</em> assumes the sound of <em>t</em>, as in <em>Fatimatu
bint-Muhammed</em>; yet that does not strike me as a valid reason for eliding the final <em>h</em>,
which among other uses, is indicative of the feminine gender, as in Fâtimah, Khadîjah,
Amînah, etc.; also of the <i><span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomina vicis</span></i>, of many abstract nouns, nouns of multitude
and of quality, as well as of adjectives of intensiveness, all which important indications
would be lost by dropping the final <em>h</em>. And further unless the vowel <em>a</em>, left after the
elision of that letter, be furnished with some etymological mark of distinction, there would
be great risk of its being confounded with the <em>â</em>, formative of the singular of many verbal
nouns, such as <em>binâ</em>, <em>safâ</em>, <em>jalâ</em>; with the masculine plurals ending in the same letters,
such as <em>hukamâ</em>, <em>ághniyâ</em>, <em>kúfarâ</em>; and with the feminine plurals of many adjectives,
such as <em>kúbra</em>, <em>súghra</em>, <em>húsna</em>, etc. Dr. Redhouse says that ’many eminent Arabists
avoid such errors’—a remark which rather surprises me, since Pocock, Lane and
Palmer, and Fresnel and Perron among French Orientalists, as also Burton, all retain
the final aspirate <em>h</em>, the latter taking special care to distinguish, by some adequate,
diacritical sign, those substantive and adjective forms with which words ending in the
final aspirate <em>h</em> might otherwise be confounded.”</p>

with so gross and palpable a fallacy. Men are not born equal, nor do they become equal
before their death-days even in condition, except by artificial levelling; and in republics

ever prevail. Still falser is the shibboleth-crow of the French cock, “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Liberté, Egalité,

the only instance where in the MS. the aorist is preceded by the preposition “bi,” a
construction now so common in the popular dialects. Strange as it may appear at first
sight, it has a deep foundation in the grammatical sentiment, if I may say so, of the
Arabic language, which always ascribed a more or less nominal character to the aorist.
Hence its inflection by Raf’ (u), Nasb (a) and Jazm (absence of final vowel), corresponding
to the nominative, accusative and oblique case of the noun. Moreover in the
old language itself already another preposition (“li”) was joined to the aorist. The
less surprising, therefore, can it be to find that the use of a preposition in connection
with it has so largely increased in the modern idiom, where it serves to mark this semi-nominal
character of the aorist, which otherwise would be lost in consequence of the
loss of the vowel terminations. This interesting subject deserves a fuller development,
