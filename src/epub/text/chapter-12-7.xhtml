<p>I overtravelled whilome lands and climes and towns and
visited the cities of high renown and traversed the ways of
dangers and hardships. Towards the last of my life, I entered
a city of the cities of China,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6075" id="noteref-6075" epub:type="noteref">6075</a> wherein was a king of the Chosroës
and the Tobbas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6076" id="noteref-6076" epub:type="noteref">6076</a> and the Cæsars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6077" id="noteref-6077" epub:type="noteref">6077</a> Now that city had been
peopled with its inhabitants by means of justice and equity; but
its then king was a tyrant dire who despoiled lives and souls
at his desire; in fine, there was no warming oneself at his fire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6078" id="noteref-6078" epub:type="noteref">6078</a>
for that indeed he oppressed the believing band and wasted the
land. Now he had a younger brother, who was king in Samarkand
of the Persians, and the two kings sojourned a while of
time, each in his own city and stead, till they yearned unto each
other and the elder king despatched his Wazir to fetch his
younger brother. When the Minister came to the King of
Samarkand and acquainted him with his errand, he submitted
himself to the bidding of his brother and answered, “To hear
is to obey.” Then he equipped himself and made ready for
wayfare and brought forth his tents and pavilions. A while after
midnight, he went in to his wife, that he might farewell her, and
found with her a strange man, lying by her in one bed. So he
slew them both and dragging them out by the feet, cast them
away and set forth on his march. When he came to his brother’s
court, the elder king rejoiced in him with joy exceeding and
lodged him in the pavilion of hospitality beside his own palace.
Now this pavilion overlooked a flower-garden belonging to the
elder brother and there the younger abode with him some days.
Then he called to mind that which his wife had done with him
and remembered her slaughter and bethought him how he was
a king, yet was not exempt from the shifts of Time; and this
affected him with exceeding affect, so that it drave him to abstain
from meat and drink, or, if he ate anything, it profited him naught.
When his brother saw him on such wise, he deemed that this had
betided him by reason of severance from his folk and family, and
said to him, “Come, let us fare forth a-coursing and a-hunting.”
But he refused to go with him; so the elder brother went to the
chase, whilst the younger abode in the pavilion aforesaid. Now,
as he was diverting himself by looking out upon the flower-garden
from the latticed window of the palace, behold, he saw his
brother’s wife and with her ten black slaves and ten slave-girls.
Each slave laid hold of a damsel and another slave came forth
and did the like with the queen; and when they had their wills
one of other they all returned whence they came. Hereat there
betided the King of Samarkand exceeding surprise and solace
and he was made whole of his malady, little by little. After a
few days, his brother returned, and finding him cured of his
complaint, said to him, “Tell me, O my brother, what was the
cause of thy sickness and thy pallor, and what is the reason of the
return of health to thee and of rosiness to thy face after this?”
So he acquainted him with the whole case and this was grievous
to him; but they hid their affair and agreed to leave the kingship
and fare forth a-pilgrimaging and adventuring at hap-hazard, for
they deemed that there had befallen none the like of what had
befallen them. Accordingly, they went forth and as they
journeyed, they saw by the way a woman imprisoned in seven
chests, whereon were five padlocks, and sunken deep in the midst
of the salt sea, under the guardianship of an Ifrit; yet for all
this that woman issued out of the ocean and opened those padlocks
and coming forth of those chests, did what she would with
the two brothers, after she had practised upon the Ifrit. When
the two kings saw that woman’s fashion and how she circumvented
the Ifrit, who had lodged her in the abyss of the main,
they turned back to their kingdoms and the younger betook himself
to Samarkand, whilst the elder returned to China and
contrived for himself a custom in the slaughter of damsels, which
was, his Wazir used to bring him every night a girl, with whom
he lay that night, and when he arose in the morning, he gave
her to the Minister and bade him do her die. After this fashion
he abode a long time, whilst the folk murmured and God’s
creatures were destroyed and the commons cried out by reason
of that grievous affair into which they were fallen and feared
the wrath of Allah Almighty, dreading lest He destroy them by
means of this. Still the king persisted in that practice and in his
blameworthy intent of the killing of damsels and the despoilment
of maidens concealed by veils,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6079" id="noteref-6079" epub:type="noteref">6079</a> wherefore the girls sought succour
of the Lord of All-might, and complained to Him of the tyranny
of the king and of his oppression. Now the king’s Wazir had
two daughters, sisters german, the elder of whom had read the
books and made herself mistress of the sciences and studied the
writings of the sages and the stories of the cup-companions,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6080" id="noteref-6080" epub:type="noteref">6080</a> and
she was a maiden of abundant lore and knowledge galore and
wit than which naught can be more. She heard that which the
folk suffered from that king in his misusage of their children;
whereupon ruth for them gat hold of her and jealousy and she
besought Allah Almighty that He would bring the king to
renounce that his new and accursed custom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6081" id="noteref-6081" epub:type="noteref">6081</a> and the Lord
answered her prayer. Then she consulted her younger sister and
said to her, “I mean to devise a device for freeing the children of
folk; to wit, I will go up to the king and offer myself to marry
him, and when I come to his presence, I will send to fetch thee.
When thou comest in to me and the king hath had his carnal will
of me, do thou say to me:—O my sister, let me hear a story of
thy goodly stories, wherewith we may beguile the waking hours of
our night, till the dawn, when we take leave each of other; and
let the king hear it likewise!” The other replied “’Tis well; forsure
this contrivance will deter the king from this innovation he
practiseth and thou shalt be requited with favour exceeding and
recompense abounding in the world to come, for that indeed thou
perilest thy life and wilt either perish or win to thy wish.” So
she did this and Fortune favoured her and the Divine direction
was vouchsafed to her and she discovered her design to her sire,
the Wazir, who thereupon forbade her, fearing her slaughter.
However, she repeated her words to him a second time and a
third, but he consented not. Then he cited to her a parable,
which should deter her, and she cited to him a parable of import
contrary to his, and the debate was prolonged between them and
the adducing of instances, till her father saw that he was powerless
to turn her from her purpose and she said to him, “There is no
help but that I marry the King, so haply I may be a sacrifice for
the children of the Moslems: either I shall turn him from this his
heresy or I shall die.” When the Minister despaired of dissuading
her, he went up to the king and acquainted him with the case,
saying, “I have a maiden daughter and she desireth to give herself
in free gift to the King.” Quoth the King, “How can thy soul
consent to this, seeing that thou knowest I abide but a single
night with a girl and when I arise on the morrow, I do her dead,
and ’tis thou who slayest her, and again and again thou hast done
this?” Quoth the Wazir, “Know, O king, that I have set forth all
this to her, yet consented she not to aught, but needs must she
have thy company and she chooseth to come to thee and present
herself before thee, albeit I have cited to her the sayings of the
sages; but she hath answered me with more than that which I said
to her and contrariwise.” Then quoth the king, “Suffer her visit
me this night and to-morrow morning come thou and take her and
kill her; and by Allah, an thou slay her not, I will slay thee and
her also!” The Minister obeyed the king’s bidding and going
out from the presence returned home. When it was night, he
took his elder daughter and carried her up to the king; and when
she came before him she wept;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6082" id="noteref-6082" epub:type="noteref">6082</a> whereupon he asked her, “What
causeth thee weep? indeed, ’twas thou who willedst this.” She
answered, “I weep not but of longing after my little sister; for
that, since we grew up, I and she, I have never been parted from
her till this day; so, an it please the King to send for her, that I
may look on her, and listen to her speech and take my fill of her
till the morning, this were a boon and an act of kindness of the
King.” So he bade fetch the damsel and she came. Then there
befel that which befel of his union with the elder sister,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6083" id="noteref-6083" epub:type="noteref">6083</a> and when
he went up to his couch, that he might sleep, the younger sister
said to her elder, “Allah, upon thee, O my sister, an thou be not
asleep, tell us a tale of thy goodly tales, wherewith we may beguile
the watches of our night, ere day dawn and parting.” Said she,
“With love and gladness;” and fell to relating to her, whilst the
king listened. Her story was goodly and delectable, and whilst
she was in the midst of telling it, the dawn brake. Now the king’s
heart clave to the hearing of the rest of the story; so he respited
her till the morrow; and, when it was the next night, she told him
a tale concerning the marvels of the lands and the wonders of
Allah’s creatures which was yet stranger and rarer than the first.
In the midst of the recital, appeared the day and she was silent
from the permitted say. So he let her live till the following night,
that he might hear the end of the history and after that slay her.
On this wise it fortuned with her; but as regards the people of
the city, they rejoiced and were glad and blessed the Wazir’s
daughters, marvelling for that three days had passed and that the
king had not put his bride to death and exulting in that he had
returned to the ways of righteousness and would never again
burthen himself with blood-guilt against any of the maidens of
the city. Then, on the fourth night, she related to him a still
more extraordinary adventure, and on the fifth night she told him
anecdotes of Kings and Wazirs and Notables. Brief, she ceased not
to entertain him many days and nights, while the king still said
to himself, “Whenas I shall have heard the end of the tale, I will
do her die,” and the people redoubled their marvel and admiration.
Also, the folk of the circuits and cities heard of this thing, to wit,
that the king had turned from his custom and from that which he
had imposed upon himself and had renounced his heresy, wherefor
they rejoiced and the lieges returned to the capital and took up
their abode therein, after they had departed thence; and they
were constant in prayer to Allah Almighty that He would stablish
the king in his present stead. “And this,” said Shahrazad, “is
the end of that which my friend related to me.” Quoth Shahryar,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6084" id="noteref-6084" epub:type="noteref">6084</a>
“O Shahrazad, finish for us the tale thy friend told thee, inasmuch
as it resembleth the story of a King whom I knew; but fain would
I hear that which betided the people of this city and what they
said of the affair of the King, so I may return from the case
wherein I was.” She replied, “With love and gladness!” Know,
O auspicious king and lord of right rede and praiseworthy meed
and prowest of deed, that, when the folk heard how the king
had put away from him his malpractice and returned from his
unrighteous wont, they rejoiced in this with joy exceeding and
offered up prayers for him. Then they talked one with other of the
cause of the slaughter of the maidens, and the wise said, “Women
are not all alike, nor are the fingers of the hand alike.” Now
when King Shahryar heard this story he came to himself and
awaking from his drunkenness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6085" id="noteref-6085" epub:type="noteref">6085</a> said, “By Allah, this story is my
story and this case is my case, for that indeed I was in reprobation
and danger of judgment till thou turnedst me back from this into
the right way, extolled be the Causer of causes and the Liberator
of necks!” presently adding, “Indeed, O Shahrazad, thou hast
awakened me to many things and hast aroused me from mine
ignorance of the right.” Then said she to him, “O chief of the
kings, the wise say:—The kingship is a building, whereof the
troops are the base, and when the foundation is strong, the building
endureth; wherefore it behoveth the king to strengthen the foundation,
for that they say, Whenas the base is weak, the building
falleth. In like fashion it besitteth the king to care for his troops
and do justice among his lieges, even as the owner of the garden
careth for his trees and cutteth away the weeds that have no profit
in them; and so it befitteth the king to look into the affairs of his
Ryots and fend off oppression from them. As for thee, O king,
it behoveth thee that thy Wazir be virtuous and experienced in
the requirements of the people and the peasantry; and indeed
Allah the Most High hath named his name<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6086" id="noteref-6086" epub:type="noteref">6086</a> in the history of Musà
(on whom be the Peace!) when he saith:—And make me a Wazir
of my people, Aaron. Now could a Wazir have been dispensed
withal, Moses son of Imrán had been worthier than any to do without
a Minister. As for the Wazir, the Sultan discovereth unto him
his affairs, private and public; and know, O king, that the likeness
of thee with the people is that of the leach with the sick man; and
the essential condition of the Minister is that he be soothfast in his
sayings, reliable in all his relations, rich in ruth for the folk and in
tenderness of transacting with them. Verily, it is said, O king, that
good troops be like the druggist; if his perfumes reach thee not,
thou still smellest the fragrance of them; and bad entourage be
like the blacksmith; if his sparks burn thee not, thou smellest his
evil smell. So it befitteth thee take to thyself a virtuous Wazir,
a veracious counsellor, even as thou takest unto thee a wife
displayed before thy face, because thou needest the man’s
righteousness for thine own right directing, seeing that, if thou do
righteously, the commons will do right, and if thou do wrongously,
they also will do wrong.” When the King heard this, drowsiness
overcame him and he slept and presently awaking, called for the
candles; so they were lighted and he sat down on his couch and
seating Shahrazad by him, smiled in her face. She kissed the
ground before him and said, “O king of the age and lord of the
time and the years, extolled be the Forgiving, the Bountiful, who
hath sent me to thee, of His grace and good favour, so I have
incited thee to longing after Paradise; for verily this which thou
wast wont do was never done of any of the kings before thee. Then
laud be to the Lord who hath directed thee into the right way,
and who from the paths of frowardness hath diverted thee! As
for women, Allah Almighty maketh mention of them also
when He saith in His Holy Book:—“Truly, the men who
resign themselves to Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6087" id="noteref-6087" epub:type="noteref">6087</a> and the women who resign
themselves, and the true-believing men and the true-believing
women and the devout men and the devout women and
truthful men and truthful women, and long-suffering men and
long-suffering women, and the humble men and the humble women,
and charitable men and charitable women, and the men who fast
and the women who fast, and men who guard their privities and
women who guard their privities, and men who are constantly
mindful of Allah and women who are constantly mindful, for
them Allah hath prepared forgiveness and a rich reward.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6088" id="noteref-6088" epub:type="noteref">6088</a> As
for that which hath befallen thee, verily, it hath befallen many
kings before thee and their women have falsed them, for all they
were more majestical of puissance than thou, and mightier of kingship
and had troops more manifold. If I would, I could relate
unto thee, O king, concerning the wiles of women, that whereof I
should not make an end all my life long; and indeed, in all these
my nights that I have passed before thee, I have told thee many
tales of the wheedling of women and of their craft; but soothly
the things abound on me;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6089" id="noteref-6089" epub:type="noteref">6089</a> so, an thou please, O king, I will relate
to thee somewhat of that which befel olden kings of perfidy from
their women and of the calamities which overtook them by
reason of these deceivers.” Asked the king, “How so? Tell
on;” and she answered, “Hearkening and obedience. It hath
been told me, O king, that a man once related to a company
