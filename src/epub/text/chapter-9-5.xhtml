			<h2 epub:type="title">Abú Kír the Dyer and Abú Sír the Barber</h2>

<p class="c017">There dwelt once, in Alexandria city, two men, of whom one was
a dyer, by name Abú Kír, and the other a barber Abú Sír;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4219" id="noteref-4219" epub:type="noteref">4219</a> and
they were neighbours in the market-street, where their shops stood
side by side. The dyer was a swindler and a liar, an exceeding
wicked wight, as if indeed his head-temples were hewn out of a
boulder rock or fashioned of the threshold of a Jewish synagogue,
nor was he ashamed of any shameful work he wrought amongst
the folk. It was his wont, when any brought him cloth for
staining, first to require of him payment under pretence of buying
dye-stuffs therewith. So the customer would give him the wage in
advance and wend his ways, and the dyer would spend all he
received on meat and drink; after which he would sell the cloth
itself as soon as ever its owner turned his back and waste its worth
in eating and drinking and what not else, for he ate not but of the
daintiest and most delicate viands nor drank but of the best of
that which doth away the wit of man. And when the owner of
the cloth came to him, he would say to him, “Return to me
to-morrow before sunrise and thou shalt find thy stuff dyed.” So
the customer would go away, saying to himself, “One day is near
another day,” and return next day at the appointed time, when the
dyer would say to him, “Come to-morrow; yesterday I was not at
work, for I had with me guests and was occupied with doing what
their wants required till they went: but to-morrow before sunrise
come and take thy cloth dyed.” So he would fare forth and
return on the third day, when Abu Kir would say to him, “Indeed
yesterday I was excusable, for my wife was brought to bed in the
night and all day I was busy with manifold matters; but to-morrow,
without fail, come and take thy cloth dyed.” When the
man came again at the appointed time, he would put him off with
some other pretence, it mattered little what, and would swear to
him;——Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that every time
the owner of an article came to the dyer he would put him off with
any pretext<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4220" id="noteref-4220" epub:type="noteref">4220</a> and would swear to him; nor would he cease to
promise and swear to him, as often as he came, till the customer
lost patience and said, “How often wilt thou say to me,
‘To-morrow?’ Give me my stuff: I will not have it dyed.”
Whereupon the dyer would make answer, “By Allah, O my
brother, I am abashed at thee; but I must tell the truth and may
Allah harm all who harm folk in their goods!” The other would
exclaim, “Tell me what hath happened;” and Abu Kir would
reply, “As for thy stuff I dyed that same on matchless wise and
hung it on the drying rope but ’twas stolen and I know not who
stole it.” If the owner of the stuff were of the kindly he would
say, “Allah will compensate me;” and if he were of the ill-conditioned,
he would haunt him with exposure and insult, but would
get nothing of him, though he complained of him to the judge.
He ceased not doing thus till his report was noised abroad among
the folk and each used to warn other against Abu Kir who became
a byword amongst them. So they all held aloof from him and
none would be entrapped by him save those who were ignorant of
his character; but, for all this, he failed not daily to suffer insult
and exposure from Allah’s creatures. By reason of this his trade
became slack and he used to go to the shop of his neighbour the
barber Abu Sír and sit there, facing the dyery and with his eyes
on the door. Whenever he espied any one who knew him not
standing at the dyery-door, with a piece of stuff in his hand, he
would leave the barber’s booth and go up to him saying, “What
seekest thou, O thou?”; and the man would reply, “Take and
dye me this thing.” So the dyer would ask, “What colour wilt
thou have it?” For, with all his knavish tricks his hand was in
all manner of dyes; but he was never true to any one; wherefore
poverty had gotten the better of him. Then he would take the
stuff and say, “Give me my wage in advance and come to-morrow
and take the stuff.” So the stranger would advance him the
money and wend his way; whereupon Abu Kir would carry the
cloth to the market-street and sell it and with its price buy meat
and vegetables and tobacco<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4221" id="noteref-4221" epub:type="noteref">4221</a> and fruit and what not else he needed;
but, whenever he saw any one who had given him stuff to dye
standing at the door of his shop, he would not come forth to him
or even show himself to him. On this wise he abode years and
years, till it fortuned one day that he received cloth to dye from a
man of wrath and sold it and spent the proceeds. The owner
came to him every day, but found him not in his shop; for, whenever
he espied any one who had claim against him, he would flee
from him into the shop of the barber Abu Sir. At last, that angry
man finding that he was not to be seen and growing weary of such
work, repaired to the Kazi and bringing one of his serjeants to the
shop, nailed up the door, in presence of a number of Moslems, and
sealed it, for that he saw therein naught save some broken pans of
earthenware to stand him instead of his stuff; after which the
serjeant took the key, saying to the neighbours, “Tell him to bring
back this man’s cloth then come to me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4222" id="noteref-4222" epub:type="noteref">4222</a> and take his shop key;”
and went his way, he and the man. Then said Abu Sir to Abu
Kir, “What ill business is this?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4223" id="noteref-4223" epub:type="noteref">4223</a> Whoever bringeth thee aught
thou losest it for him. What hath become of this angry man’s
stuff?” Answered the dyer, “O my neighbour, ’twas stolen from
me.” “Prodigious!” exclaimed the barber. “Whenever any one
giveth thee aught, a thief stealeth it from thee! Art thou then
the meeting-place of every rogue upon town? But I doubt me
thou liest: so tell me the truth.” Replied Abu Kir, “O my
neighbour, none hath stolen aught from me.” Asked Abu Sir,
“What then dost thou with the people’s property?”; and the
dyer answered, “Whenever any one giveth me aught to dye, I sell
it and spend the price.” Quoth Abu Sir, “Is this permitted thee
of Allah?” and quoth Abu Kir, “I do this only out of poverty,
because business is slack with me and I am poor and have
nothing.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4224" id="noteref-4224" epub:type="noteref">4224</a> And he went on to complain to him of the dulness
of his trade and his lack of means. Abu Sir in like manner
lamented the little profit of his own calling, saying, “I am a
master of my craft and have not my equal in this city; but no one
cometh to me to be polled, because I am a pauper; and I loathe
this art and mystery, O my brother.” Abu Kir replied, “And I
also loathe my own craft, by reason of its slackness; but, O my
brother, what call is there for our abiding in this town? Let us
depart from it, I and thou, and solace ourselves in the lands of
mankind, carrying in our hands our crafts which are in demand all
the world over; so shall we breathe the air and rest from this
grievous trouble.” And he ceased not to commend travel to
Abu Sir, till the barber became wishful to set out; so they agreed
upon their route,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu
Kir ceased not his praises of wayfaring to Abu Sir till the barber
became wishful to depart; so they agreed upon their route, at
which decision Abu Kir rejoiced and improvised these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Leave thy home for abroad an wouldst rise on high, ✿ And travel whence benefits five-fold rise;</div>
      <div class="line">The soothing of sorrow and winning of bread, ✿ Knowledge, manners and commerce with good men and wise.</div>
      <div class="line">An they say that in travel are travail and care, ✿ And disunion of friends and much hardship that tries;</div>
      <div class="line">Yet to generous youth death is better than life ✿ In the house of contempt betwixt haters and spies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When they agreed to travel together Abu Kir said to Abu Sir, “O
my neighbour, we are become brethren and there is no difference
between us, so it behoveth us to recite the Fátihah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4225" id="noteref-4225" epub:type="noteref">4225</a> that he of us
who gets work shall of his gain feed him who is out of work, and
whatever is left, we will lay in a chest; and when we return to
Alexandria, we will divide it fairly and equally.” “So be it,”
replied Abu Sir, and they repeated the Opening Chapter of the
Koran on this understanding. Then Abu Sir locked up his shop
and gave the key to its owner, whilst Abu Kir left his door locked
and sealed and let the key lie with the Kazi’s serjeant; after which
they took their baggage and embarked on the morrow in a galleon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4226" id="noteref-4226" epub:type="noteref">4226</a>
upon the salt sea. They set sail the same day and fortune attended
them, for, of Abu Sir’s great good luck, there was not a barber in
the ship albeit it carried an hundred and twenty men, besides
captain and crew. So, when they loosed the sails, the barber said
to the dyer, “O my brother, this is the sea and we shall need meat
and drink; we have but little provaunt with us and haply the
voyage will be long upon us; wherefore methinks I will shoulder
my budget and pass among the passengers, and may be some one
will say to me:—Come hither, O barber, and shave me, and I will
shave him for a scone or a silver bit or a draught of water: so
shall we profit by this, I and thou too.” “There’s no harm in
that,” replied the dyer and laid down his head and slept, whilst
the barber took his gear and water-tasse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4227" id="noteref-4227" epub:type="noteref">4227</a> and throwing over his
shoulder a rag, to serve as napkin (because he was poor), passed
among the passengers. Quoth one of them, “Ho, master, come
and shave me.” So he shaved him, and the man gave him a half-dirham;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4228" id="noteref-4228" epub:type="noteref">4228</a>
whereupon quoth Abu Sir, “O my brother, I have no
use for this bit; hadst thou given me a scone ’twere more blessed
to me in this sea, for I have a shipmate and we are short of provision.”
So he gave him a loaf and a slice of cheese and filled him
the tasse with sweet water. The barber carried all this to Abu
Kir and said, “Eat the bread and cheese and drink the water.”
Accordingly he ate and drank, whilst Abu Sir again took up his
shaving gear and, tasse in hand and rag on shoulder, went round
about the deck among the passengers. One man he shaved for
two scones and another for a bittock of cheese, and he was in
demand, because there was no other barber on board. Also he
bargained with every one who said to him, “Ho, master, shave
me!” for two loaves and a half-dirham, and they gave him whatever
he sought, so that, by sundown, he had collected thirty loaves
and thirty silvers with store of cheese and olives and botargoes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4229" id="noteref-4229" epub:type="noteref">4229</a>
And besides these he got from the passengers whatever he
asked for and was soon in possession of things galore. Amongst
the rest he shaved the Captain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4230" id="noteref-4230" epub:type="noteref">4230</a> to whom he complained of his
lack of victual for the voyage, and the skipper said to him, “Thou
art welcome to bring thy comrade every night and sup with me
and have no care for that so long as ye sail with us.” Then he
returned to the dyer, whom he found asleep; so he roused him;
and when Abu Kir awoke, he saw at his head an abundance of
bread and cheese and olives and botargoes and said, “Whence
gottest thou all this?” “From the bounty of Allah Almighty,”
replied Abu Sir. Then Abu Kir would have fallen to, but the
barber said to him, “Eat not of this, O my brother; but leave it
to serve us another time; for know that I shaved the Captain and
complained to him of our lack of victual: whereupon quoth he:—Welcome
to thee! Bring thy comrade and sup both of ye with me
every night. And this night we sup with him for the first time.”
But Abu Kir replied, “My head goeth round with sea-sickness
and I cannot rise from my stead; so let me sup off these things
and fare thou alone to the Captain.” Abu Sir replied, “There is
no harm in that;” and sat looking at the other as he ate, and
saw him hew off gobbets, as the quarryman heweth stone from
the hill-quarries and gulp them down with the gulp of an elephant
which hath not eaten for days, bolting another mouthful ere he
had swallowed the previous one and glaring the while at that
which was before him with the glowering of a Ghul and blowing
as bloweth the hungry bull over his beans and
bruised straw. Presently up came a sailor and said to the
barber, “O craftsmaster, the Captain biddeth thee come to supper
and bring thy comrade.” Quoth the barber to the dyer, “Wilt
thou come with us?”; but quoth he, “I cannot walk.” So the
barber went by himself and found the Captain sitting before a tray
whereon were a score or more of dishes and all the company were
awaiting him and his mate. When the Captain saw him he
asked, “Where is thy friend?”; and Abu Sir answered, “O my
lord, he is sea-sick.” Said the skipper, “That will do him no
harm; his sickness will soon pass off; but do thou carry him his
supper and come back, for we tarry for thee.” Then he set apart
a porringer of Kabábs and putting therein some of each dish, till
there was enough for ten, gave it to Abu Sir, saying, “Take this
to thy chum.” He took it and carried it to the dyer, whom he
found grinding away with his dog-teeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4231" id="noteref-4231" epub:type="noteref">4231</a> at the food which was
before him, as he were a camel, and heaping mouthful on mouthful
in his hurry. Quoth Abu Sir, “Did I not say to thee:—Eat
not of this? Indeed the Captain is a kindly man. See what
he hath sent thee, for that I told him thou wast sea-sick.” “Give
it here,” cried the dyer. So the barber gave him the platter, and
he snatched it from him and fell upon his food, ravening for it
and resembling a grinning dog or a raging lion or a Rukh pouncing
on a pigeon or one well-nigh dead for hunger who seeing meat
falls ravenously to eat. Then Abu Sir left him and going back to
the Captain, supped and enjoyed himself and drank coffee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4232" id="noteref-4232" epub:type="noteref">4232</a> with
him; after which he returned to Abu Kir and found that he had
eaten all that was in the porringer and thrown it aside, empty.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Abu Sir returned to Abu Kir he saw that he had eaten all that
was in the porringer and had thrown it aside empty. So he took
it up and gave it to one of the Captain’s servants, then went back
to Abu Kir and slept till the morning. On the morrow he
continued to shave, and all he got by way of meat and drink he
gave to his shipmate, who ate and drank and sat still, rising not
save to do what none could do for him, and every night the barber
brought him a full porringer from the Captain’s table. They
fared thus twenty days until the galleon cast anchor in the
harbour of a city; whereupon they took leave of the skipper and
landing, entered the town and hired them a closet in a Khan. Abu
Sir furnished it and buying a cooking pot and a platter and
spoons<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4233" id="noteref-4233" epub:type="noteref">4233</a> and what else they needed, fetched meat and cooked it;
but Abu Kir fell asleep the moment he entered the Caravanserai
and awoke not till Abu Sir aroused him and set the tray of food<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4234" id="noteref-4234" epub:type="noteref">4234</a>
before him. When he awoke, he ate and saying to Abu Sir,
“Blame me not, for I am giddy,” fell asleep again. Thus he did
forty days, whilst, every day, the barber took his gear and making
the round of the city, wrought for that which fell to his lot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4235" id="noteref-4235" epub:type="noteref">4235</a> and
returning, found the dyer asleep and aroused him. The moment
he awoke he fell ravenously upon the food, eating as one who
cannot have his fill nor be satisfied; after which he went asleep
again. On this wise he passed other forty days and whenever the
barber said to him, “Sit up and be comfortable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4236" id="noteref-4236" epub:type="noteref">4236</a> and go forth
and take an airing in the city, for ’tis a gay place and a pleasant
and hath not its equal among the cities,” he would reply, “Blame
me not, for I am giddy.” Abu Sir cared not to hurt his feelings
nor give him hard words; but, on the forty-first day, he himself
fell sick and could not go abroad; so he engaged the porter of
the Khan to serve them both, and he did the needful for them
and brought them meat and drink whilst Abu Kir would do
nothing but eat and sleep. The man ceased not to wait upon
them on this wise for four days, at the end of which time the
barber’s malady redoubled on him, till he lost his senses for stress
of sickness; and Abu Kir, feeling the sharp pangs of hunger, arose
and sought in his comrade’s clothes, where he found a thousand
silver bits. He took them and, shutting the door of the closet
upon Abu Sir, fared forth without telling any; and the doorkeeper
was then at market and thus saw him not go out. Presently Abu
Kir betook himself to the bazar and clad himself in costly clothes, at
a price of five hundred half-dirhams; then he proceeded to walk
about the streets and divert himself by viewing the city which he
found to be one whose like was not among cities; but he noted
that all its citizens were clad in clothes of white and blue, without
other colour. Presently he came to a dyer’s and seeing naught
but blue in his shop, pulled out to him a kerchief and said, “O
master, take this and dye it and win thy wage.” Quoth the dyer,
“The cost of dyeing this will be twenty dirhams;” and quoth Abu
Kir, “In our country we dye it for two.” “Then go and dye it in
your own country! As for me, my price is twenty dirhams and I
will not bate a little thereof.” “What colour wilt thou dye it?”
“I will dye it blue.” “But I want it dyed red.” “I know not
how to dye red.” “Then dye it green.” “I know not how to dye
green.” “Yellow.” “Nor yet yellow.” Thereupon Abu Kir
went on to name the different tints to him, one after other,
till the dyer said, “We are here in this city forty master-dyers,
not one more nor one less; and when one of us dieth,
we teach his son the craft. If he leave no son, we abide lacking
one, and if he leave two sons, we teach one of them the craft, and
if he die, we teach his brother. This our craft is strictly ordered,
and we know how to dye but blue and no other tint whatsoever.”
Then said Abu Kir, “Know that I too am a dyer and wot how to
dye all colours; and I would have thee take me into thy service
on hire, and I will teach thee everything of my art, so thou mayst
glory therein over all the company of dyers.” But the dyer
answered, “We never admit a stranger into our craft.” Asked
Abu Kir, “And what if I open a dyery for myself?”; whereto the
other answered, “We will not suffer thee to do that on any wise;”
whereupon he left him and going to a second dyer, made him the
like proposal; but he returned him the same answer as the first;
and he ceased not to go from one to other, till he had made the
round of the whole forty masters; but they would not accept him
either to master or apprentice. Then he repaired to the Shaykh
of the Dyers and told him what had passed, and he said, “We
admit no strangers into our craft.” Hereupon Abu Kir became
exceeding wroth and going up to the King of that city, made complaint
to him, saying, “O King of the age, I am a stranger and a
dyer by trade”; and he told him whatso had passed between himself
and the dyers of the town, adding, “I can dye various kinds
of red, such as rose-colour and jujube-colour and various kinds of
green, such as grass-green and pistachio-green and olive and
parrot’s wing, and various kinds of black, such as coal-black and
Kohl-black, and various shades of yellow, such as orange<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4237" id="noteref-4237" epub:type="noteref">4237</a><a id="t143"></a> and
lemon-colour,” and went on to name to him the rest of the colours.
Then said he, “O King of the age, all the dyers in thy city can not
turn out of hand any one of these tincts, for they know not how to
dye aught but blue; yet will they not admit me amongst them,
either to master or apprentice.” Answered the King, “Thou sayst
sooth for that matter, but I will open to thee a dyery and give thee
capital and have thou no care anent them; for whoso offereth to
do thee let or hindrance, I will hang him over his shop-door.”
Then he sent for builders and said to them, “Go round about the
city with this master-dyer, and whatsoever place pleaseth him, be
it shop or Khan or what not, turn out its occupier and build him a
dyery after his wish. Whatsoever he biddeth you, that do ye and
oppose him not in aught.” And he clad him in a handsome suit
and gave him two white slaves to serve him, and a horse with
housings of brocade and a thousand dinars, saying, “Expend this
upon thyself against the building be completed.” Accordingly
Abu Kir donned the dress and mounting the horse, became as he
were an Emir. Moreover the King assigned him a house and
bade furnish it; so they furnished it for him.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
King assigned a house to Abu Kir and bade furnish it and he took
up his abode therein. On the morrow he mounted and rode
through the city, whilst the architects went before him; and he
looked about him till he saw a place which pleased him and said,
“This stead is seemly;” whereupon they turned out the owner
and carried him to the King, who gave him as the price of his
holding, what contented him and more. Then the builders fell to
work, whilst Abu Kir said to them, “Build thus and thus and do
this and that,” till they built him a dyery that had not its like;
whereupon he presented himself before the King and informed
him that they had done building the dyery and that there needed
but the price of the dye-stuffs and gear to set it going. Quoth the
King, “Take these four thousand dinars to thy capital and let me
see the first fruits of thy dyery.” So he took the money and went
to the market where, finding dye-stuffs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4238" id="noteref-4238" epub:type="noteref">4238</a> plentiful and well-nigh
worthless, he bought all he needed of materials for dyeing; and
the King sent him five hundred pieces of stuff, which he set
himself to dye of all colours and then he spread them before the
door of his dyery. When the folk passed by the shop, they saw
a wonder-sight whose like they had never in their lives seen; so
they crowded about the entrance, enjoying the spectacle and questioning
the dyer and saying, “O master, what are the names of
these colours?” Quoth he, “This is red and that yellow and the
other green” and so on, naming the rest of the colours. And they
fell to bringing him longcloth and saying to him, “Dye it for us
like this and that and take what hire thou seekest.” When he
had made an end of dyeing the King’s stuffs, he took them and
went up with them to the Divan; and when the King saw them
he rejoiced in them and bestowed abundant bounty on the dyer.
Furthermore, all the troops brought him stuffs, saying, “Dye for
us thus and thus;” and he dyed for them to their liking, and they
threw him gold and silver. After this his fame spread abroad and
his shop was called the Sultan’s Dyery. Good came in to him at
every door and none of the other dyers could say a word to him,
but they used to come to him kissing his hands and excusing
themselves to him for past affronts they had offered him and
saying, “Take us to thine apprentices.” But he would none of
them for he had become the owner of black slaves and handmaids
and had amassed store of wealth. On this wise fared it with Abu
Kir; but as regards Abu Sir, after the closet door had been locked
on him and his money had been stolen, he abode prostrate and
unconscious for three successive days, at the end of which the
Concierge of the Khan, chancing to look at the door, observed
that it was locked and bethought himself that he had not seen and
heard aught of the two companions for some time. So he said in
his mind, “Haply they have made off, without paying rent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4239" id="noteref-4239" epub:type="noteref">4239</a> or
perhaps they are dead, or what is to do with them?” And he
waited till sunset, when he went up to the door and heard the
barber groaning within. He saw the key in the lock; so he
opened the door and entering, found Abu Sir lying, groaning, and
said to him, “No harm to thee: where is thy friend?” Replied
Abu Sir, “By Allah, I came to my senses only this day and called
out; but none answered my call. Allah upon thee, O my brother,
look for the purse under my head and take from it five half-dirhams
and buy me somewhat nourishing, for I am sore
anhungered.” The porter put out his hand and taking the purse,
found it empty and said to the barber, “The purse is empty; there
is nothing in it.” Whereupon Abu Sir knew that Abu Kir had
taken that which was therein and had fled and he asked the
porter, “Hast thou not seen my friend?” Answered the doorkeeper,
“I have not seen him these three days; and indeed
methought you had departed, thou and he.” The barber cried,
“Not so; but he coveted my money and took it and fled seeing
me sick.” Then he fell a-weeping and a-wailing but the doorkeeper
said to him, “No harm shall befal thee, and Allah will
requite him his deed.” So he went away and cooked him some
broth, whereof he ladled out a plateful and brought it to
him; nor did he cease to tend him and maintain him with
his own monies for two months’ space, when the barber
sweated<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4240" id="noteref-4240" epub:type="noteref">4240</a> and the Almighty made him whole of his sickness.
Then he stood up and said to the porter, “An ever the Most
High Lord enable me, I will surely requite thee thy kindness to
me; but none requiteth save the Lord of His bounty!”
Answered the porter, “Praised be He for thy recovery! I dealt
not thus with thee but of desire for the face of Allah the Bountiful.”
Then the barber went forth of the Khan and threaded the
market-streets of the town, till Destiny brought him to the bazar
wherein was Abu Kir’s dyery, and he saw the vari-coloured stuffs
dispread before the shop and a jostle of folk crowding to look
upon them. So he questioned one of the townsmen and asked
him, “What place is this and how cometh it that I see the folk
crowding together?”; whereto the man answered, saying, “This
is the Sultan’s Dyery, which he set up for a foreigner Abu Kir
hight; and whenever he dyeth new stuff, we all flock to him and
divert ourselves by gazing upon his handiwork, for we have no
dyers in our land who know how to stain with these colours; and
indeed there befel him with the dyers who are in the city that
which befel.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4241" id="noteref-4241" epub:type="noteref">4241</a> And he went on to tell him all that had passed
between Abu Kir and the master-dyers and how he had complained
of them to the Sultan who took him by the hand and
built him that dyery and gave him this and that: brief, he recounted
to him all that had occurred. At this the barber rejoiced
and said in himself, “Praised be Allah who hath prospered
him, so that he is become a master of his craft! And the man is
excusable, for of a surety he hath been diverted from thee by his
work and hath forgotten thee; but thou actedst kindly by him
and entreatedst him generously, what time he was out of work;
so, when he seeth thee, he will rejoice in thee and entreat thee
generously, even as thou entreatedst him.” According he made
for the door of the dyery and saw Abu Kir seated on a high
mattress spread upon a bench beside the doorway, clad in royal
apparel and attended by four blackamoor slaves and four white
Mamelukes all robed in the richest of raiment. Moreover, he saw
the workmen, ten negro slaves, standing at work; for, when Abu
Kir bought them, he taught them the craft of dyeing, and he
himself sat amongst his cushions, as he were a Grand Wazir or a
mighty Monarch putting his hand to naught, but only saying to
the men, “Do this and do that.” So the barber went up to him
and stood before him, deeming he would rejoice in him when he
saw him and salute him and entreat him with honour and make
much of him; but, when eye fell upon eye, the dyer said to him,
“O scoundrel, how many a time have I bidden thee stand not at
the door of the workshop? Hast thou a mind to disgrace me
with the folk, thief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4242" id="noteref-4242" epub:type="noteref">4242</a> that thou art? Seize him.” So the blackamoors
ran at him and laid hold of him; and the dyer rose up
from his seat and said, “Throw him.” Accordingly they threw
him down and Abu Kir took a stick and dealt him an hundred
strokes on the back; after which they turned him over and he beat
him other hundred blows on his belly. Then he said to him, “O
scoundrel, O villain, if ever again I see thee standing at the door
of this dyery, I will forthwith send thee to the King, and he will
commit thee to the Chief of Police, that he may strike thy neck.
Begone, may Allah not bless thee!” So Abu Sir departed from
him, broken-hearted by reason of the beating and shame that had
betided him; whilst the bystanders asked Abu Kir, “What hath
this man done?” He answered, “The fellow is a thief, who
stealeth the stuffs of folk.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Abu
Kir beat Abu Sir and thrust him forth he said to those present,
“He is a thief who stealeth the stuffs of folk; he hath robbed me
of cloth, how many a time! and I still said in myself:—Allah
forgive him! He is a poor man; and I cared not to deal roughly
with him; so I used to give my customers the worth of their
goods and forbid him gently; but he would not be forbidden:
and if he come again, I will send him to the King, who will
put him to death and rid the people of his mischief.” And
the bystanders fell to abusing the barber after his back was turned.
Such was the behaviour of Abu Kir; but as regards Abu Sir, he
returned to the Khan, where he sat pondering that which the dyer
had done by him and he remained seated till the burning of the
beating subsided, when he went out and walked about the markets
of the city. Presently, he bethought him to go to the Hammam-bath;
so he said to one of the townsfolk, “O my brother, which is
the way to the Baths?” Quoth the man, “And what manner of
thing may the Baths be?” and quoth Abu Sir, “’Tis a place
where people wash themselves and do away their dirt and defilements,
and it is of the best of the good things of the world.”
Replied the townsman, “Get thee to the sea,” but the barber
rejoined, “I want the Hammam-baths.” Cried the other, “We
know not what manner of thing is the Hammam, for we all resort
to the sea; even the King, when he would wash, betaketh himself
to the sea.” When Abu Sir was assured that there was no bath
in the city and that the folk knew not the Baths nor the fashion
thereof, he betook himself to the King’s Divan and kissing ground
between his hands called down blessings on him and said, “I am
a stranger and a Bath-man by trade, and I entered thy city and
thought to go to the Hammam; but found not one therein. How
cometh a city of this comely quality to lack a Hammam, seeing
that the bath is of the highest of the delights of this world?” Quoth
the King, “What manner of thing is the Hammam?” So Abu Sir
proceeded to set forth to him the quality of the bath, saying, “Thy
capital will not be a perfect city till there be a Hammam therein.”
“Welcome to thee!” said the King and clad him in a dress
that had not its like and gave him a horse and two blackamoor
slaves, presently adding four handmaids and as many white
Mamelukes: he also appointed him a furnished house and
honoured him yet more abundantly than he had honoured the
dyer. After this he sent builders with him saying to them,
“Build him a Hammam in what place soever shall please him.”
So he took them and went with them through the midst of the
city, till he saw a stead that suited him. He pointed it out to
the builders and they set to work, whilst he directed them, and
they wrought till they builded him a Hammam that had not its like.
Then he bade them paint it, and they painted it rarely, so that it
was a delight to the beholders; after which Abu Sir went up to
the King and told him that they had made an end of building and
decorating the Hammam, adding, “There lacketh naught save
the furniture.” The King gave him ten thousand dinars wherewith
he furnished the Bath and ranged the napkins on the ropes;
and all who passed by the door stared at it and their mind was
confounded at its decorations. So the people crowded to this
spectacle, whose like they had never in their lives seen, and solaced
themselves by staring at it and saying, “What is this thing?”
To which Abu Sir replied, “This is a Hammam;” and they
marvelled thereat. Then he heated water and set the bath a-working,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4243" id="noteref-4243" epub:type="noteref">4243</a>
and he made a jetting fountain in the great basin, which
ravished the wit of all who saw it of the people of the city.
Furthermore, he sought of the King ten Mamelukes not yet come
to manhood, and he gave him ten boys like moons; whereupon
Abu Sir proceeded to shampoo them, saying, “Do in this wise
with the bathers.” Then he burnt perfumes and sent out a crier
to cry aloud in the city, saying, “O creatures of Allah, get ye to
the Baths which be called the Sultan’s Hammam!” So the lieges
came thither and Abu Sir bade the slave-boys wash their bodies.
The folk went down into the tank and coming forth, seated themselves
on the raised pavement, whilst the boys shampooed them,
even as Abu Sir had taught them; and they continued to enter
the Hammam and do their need therein gratis and go out, without
paying, for the space of three days. On the fourth day the barber
invited the King, who took horse with his Grandees and rode to
the Baths, where he put off his clothes and entered; then Abu
Sir came in to him and rubbed his body with the bag-gloves,
peeling from his skin dirt-rolls like lamp-wicks and showing them
to the King, who rejoiced therein, and clapping his hand upon
his limbs heard them ring again for very smoothness and cleanliness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4244" id="noteref-4244" epub:type="noteref">4244</a>;
after which thorough washing Abu Sir mingled rose-water
with the water of the tank and the King went down therein.
When he came forth, his body was refreshed and he felt a lightness
and liveliness such as he had never known in his life. Then
the barber made him sit on the daïs and the boys proceeded to
shampoo him, whilst the censers fumed with the finest lign-aloes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4245" id="noteref-4245" epub:type="noteref">4245</a>
Then said the King, “O master is this the Hammam?”; and Abu
Sir said, “Yes.” Quoth the King, “As my head liveth, my city
is not become a city indeed but by this Bath,” presently adding,
“But what pay takest thou for each person?” Quoth Abu Sir,
“That which thou biddest will I take;” whereupon the King cried,
“Take a thousand gold pieces for every one who washeth in thy
Hammam.” Abu Sir, however, said, “Pardon, O King of the
age! All men are not alike, but there are amongst them rich
and poor, and if I take of each a thousand dinars, the Hammam
will stand empty, for the poor man cannot pay this price.” Asked
the King, “How then wilt thou do for the price!”; and the barber
answered, “I will leave it to their generosity.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4246" id="noteref-4246" epub:type="noteref">4246</a> Each who can
afford aught shall pay that which his soul grudgeth not to give,
and we will take from every man after the measure of his means.
On this wise will the folk come to us and he who is wealthy shall
give according to his station and he who is wealth-less shall give
what he can afford. Under such condition the Hammam will still
be at work and prosper exceedingly; but a thousand dinars is a
Monarch’s gift, and not every man can avail to this.” The Lords
of the Realm confirmed Abu Sir’s words, saying, “This is the
truth, O King of the age! Thinkest thou that all folk are like
unto thee, O glorious King<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4247" id="noteref-4247" epub:type="noteref">4247</a>?” The King replied, “Ye say sooth;
but this man is a stranger and poor and ’tis incumbent on us to
deal generously with him, for that he hath made in our city this
Hammam whose like we have never in our lives seen and without
which our city were not adorned nor hath gotten importance;
wherefore, an we favour him with increase of fee ’twill not be
much.” But the Grandees said, “An thou wilt guerdon him be
generous with thine own monies, and let the King’s bounty be
extended to the poor by means of the low price of the Hammam,
so the lieges may bless thee; but, as for the thousand dinars, we
are the Lords of thy Land, yet do our souls grudge to pay it; and
how then should the poor be pleased to afford it?” Quoth the
King, “O my Grandees, for this time let each of you give him an
hundred dinars and a Mameluke, a slave girl and a blackamoor;”
and quoth they, “’Tis well; we will give it; but after to-day
whoso entereth shall give him only what he can afford, without
grudging.” “No harm in that,” said the King; and they gave
him the thousand gold pieces and three chattels. Now the
number of the Nobles who were washed with the King that day
was four hundred souls;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
number of the Nobles who were washed with the King that day were
four hundred souls; so that the total of that which they gave him
was forty thousand dinars, besides four hundred Mamelukes and
a like number of negroes and slave-girls.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4248" id="noteref-4248" epub:type="noteref">4248</a> Moreover the King
gave him ten thousand dinars, besides ten white slaves and ten
handmaidens and a like number of blackamoors; whereupon
coming forward Abu Sir kissed the ground before him and said,
“O auspicious Sovereign, lord of justice, what place will contain
me all these women and slaves?” Quoth the King, “O weak o’
wit, I bade not my nobles deal thus with thee but that we might
gather together unto thee wealth galore; for may be thou wilt
bethink thee of thy country and family and repine for them and
be minded to return to thy mother-land; so shalt thou take from
our country muchel of money to maintain thyself withal, what
while thou livest in thine own country.” And quoth Abu Sir,
“O King of the age, (Allah advance thee!) these white slaves and
women and negroes befit only Kings and hadst thou ordered me
ready money, it were more profitable to me than this army; for
they must eat and drink and dress, and whatever betideth me of
wealth, it will not suffice for their support.” The King laughed
and said, “By Allah thou speakest sooth! They are indeed a
mighty host, and thou hast not the wherewithal to maintain them;
but wilt thou sell them to me for an hundred dinars a head?”
Said Abu Sir, “I sell them to thee at that price.” So the King
sent to his treasurer for the coin and he brought it and gave Abu
Sir the whole of the price without abatement<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4249" id="noteref-4249" epub:type="noteref">4249</a> and in full tale;
after which the King restored the slaves to their owners, saying,
“Let each of you who knoweth his slaves take them; for they are
a gift from me to you.” So they obeyed his bidding and took
each what belonged to him; whilst Abu Sir said to the King,
“Allah ease thee, O King of the age, even as thou hast eased me
of these Ghuls, whose bellies none may fill save Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4250" id="noteref-4250" epub:type="noteref">4250</a>!” The
King laughed, and said he spake sooth; then, taking the Grandees
of his Realm from the Hammam returned to his palace; but the
barber passed the night in counting out his gold and laying it up
in bags and sealing them; and he had with him twenty black
slaves and a like number of Mamelukes and four slave girls to
serve him. Now when morning morrowed, he opened the
Hammam and sent out a crier to cry, saying, “Whoso entereth the
Baths and washeth shall give that which he can afford and which
his generosity requireth him to give.” Then he seated himself
by the pay-chest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4251" id="noteref-4251" epub:type="noteref">4251</a> and customers flocked in upon him, each putting
down that which was easy to him, nor had eventide evened ere the
chest was full of the good gifts of Allah the Most High. Presently
the Queen desired to go to the Hammam, and when this came to
Abu Sir’s knowledge, he divided the day on her account into two
parts, appointing that between dawn and noon to men and that
between midday and sundown to women.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4252" id="noteref-4252" epub:type="noteref">4252</a> As soon as the Queen
came, he stationed a handmaid behind the pay-chest; for he had
taught four slave-girls the service of the Hammam, so that they
were become expert bath-women and tire-women. When the Queen
entered, this pleased her and her breast waxed broad and she laid
down a thousand dinars. Thus his report was noised abroad in
the city, and all who entered the bath he entreated with honour,
were they rich or poor; good came in upon him at every door and
he made acquaintance with the royal guards and got him friends
and intimates. The King himself used to come to him one day in
every week, leaving with him a thousand dinars and the other days
were for rich and poor alike; and he was wont to deal courteously
with the folk and use them with the utmost respect. It chanced
that the King’s sea-captain came in to him one day in the bath;
so Abu Sir did off his dress and going in with him, proceeded to
shampoo him and entreated him with exceeding courtesy. When
he came forth, he made him sherbet and coffee; and when he
would have given him somewhat, he swore that he would not
accept from him aught. So the captain was under obligation to
him, by reason of his exceeding kindness and courtesy and was
perplexed how to requite the bath-man his generous dealing.
Thus fared it with Abu Sir: but as regards Abu Kir, hearing all
the people recounting wonders of the Baths and saying, “Verily,
this Hammam is the Paradise of this world! Inshallah, O such an
one, thou shalt go with us to-morrow to this delightful bath,” he
said to himself, “Needs must I fare like the rest of the world, and
see this bath that hath taken folk’s wits.” So he donned his
richest dress and mounting a she-mule and bidding the attendance
of four white slaves and four blacks, walking before and behind
him, he rode to the Hammam. When he alighted at the door, he
smelt the scent of burning aloes-wood and found people going in
and out and the benches full of great and small. So he entered the
vestibule and saw Abu Sir, who rose to him and rejoiced in him:
but the dyer said to him, “Is this the way of well-born men? I
have opened me a dyery and am become master-dyer of the city
and acquainted with the King and have risen to prosperity and
authority: yet camest thou not to me nor askest of me nor saidst,
Where’s my comrade? For my part I sought thee in vain and
sent my slaves and servants to make search for thee in all the
Khans and other places; but they knew not whither thou hadst
gone, nor could any one give me tidings of thee.” Said Abu Sir,
“Did I not come to thee and didst thou not make me out a thief
and bastinado me and dishonour me before the world?” At this
Abu Kir made a show of concern and asked, “What manner of talk
is this? Was it thou whom I beat?”: and Abu Sir answered,
“Yes, ’twas I.” Whereupon Abu Kir swore to him a thousand
oaths that he knew him not and said, “There was a fellow like
thee, who used to come every day and steal the people’s stuff, and
I took thee for him.” And he went on to pretend penitence,
beating hand upon hand and saying, “There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great? Indeed
we have sinned against thee; but would that thou hadst discovered
thyself to me and said, I am such an one! Indeed the fault is
with thee, for that thou madest not thyself known unto me, more
especially seeing that I was distracted for much business.”
Replied Abu Sir, “Allah pardon thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4253" id="noteref-4253" epub:type="noteref">4253</a> O my comrade! This
was foreordained in the Secret Purpose, and reparation is with
Allah. Enter and put off thy clothes and bathe at thine ease.”
Said the dyer, “I conjure thee, by Allah, O my brother, forgive
me!”; and said Abu Sir, “Allah acquit thee of blame and forgive
thee! Indeed this thing was decreed to me from all eternity.”
Then asked Abu Kir, “Whence gottest thou this high degree?”;
and answered Abu Sir, “He who prospered thee prospered me;
for I went up to the King and described to him the fashion of
the Hammam and he bade me build one.” And the dyer said,
“Even as thou art beknown of the King, so also am I;”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Thirty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Abu Kir and Abu Sir were exchanging reproof and excuse, the
dyer said to him, “Even as thou art beknown of the King, so also
am I; and, Inshallah,—God willing—I will make him love and
favour thee more than ever, for my sake, he knoweth not that
thou art my comrade, but I will acquaint him of this and commend
thee to him.” But Abu Sir said, “There needeth no commendation;
for He who moveth man’s heart to love still liveth; and
indeed the King and all his court affect me and have given me
this and that.” And he told him the whole tale and said to him,
“Put off thy clothes behind the chest and enter the Hammam, and
I will go in with thee and rub thee down with the glove.” So he
doffed his dress and Abu Sir, entering the bath with him, soaped
him and gloved him and then dressed him and busied himself with
his service till he came forth, when he brought him dinner and
sherbets, whilst all the folk marvelled at the honour he did him.
Then Abu Kir would have given him somewhat; but he swore
that he would not accept aught from him and said to him, “Shame
upon such doings! Thou art my comrade, and there is no difference
between us.” Then Abu Kir observed, “By Allah, O my
comrade, this is a mighty fine Hammam of thine, but there lacketh
somewhat in its ordinance.” Asked Abu Sir, “And what is
that?” and Abu Kir answered, “It is the depilatory,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4254" id="noteref-4254" epub:type="noteref">4254</a> to wit, the
paste compounded of yellow arsenic and quicklime which removeth
the hair with comfort. Do thou prepare it and next time the King
cometh, present it to him, teaching him how he shall cause the
hair to fall off by such means, and he will love thee with exceeding
love and honour thee.” Quoth Abu Sir, “Thou speakest sooth,
and Inshallah, I will at once make it.” Then Abu Kir left him
and mounted his mule and going to the King said to him, “I have
a warning to give thee, O King of the age!” “And what is thy
warning?” asked the King; and Abu Kir answered, “I hear that
thou hast built a Hammam.” Quoth the King, “Yes: there came
to me a stranger and I builded the Baths for him, even as I builded
the dyery for thee; and indeed ’tis a mighty fine Hammam and
an ornament to my city;” and he went on to describe to him the
virtues of the bath. Quoth the dyer, “Hast thou entered therein?”;
and quoth the King, “Yes.” Thereupon cried Abu Kir,
“Alhamdolillah—praised be God,—who saved thee from the mischief
of yonder villain and foe of the Faith, I mean the bath-keeper!”
The King enquired, “And what of him?”; and Abu
Kir replied, “Know, O King of the age that, an thou enter the
Hammam again, after this day, thou wilt surely perish.” “How
so?” said the King; and the dyer said, “This bath-keeper is thy
foe and the foe of the Faith, and he induced thee not to stablish
this Bath but because he designed therein to poison thee. He
hath made for thee somewhat and he will present it to thee when
thou enterest the Hammam, saying:—This is a drug which, if one
apply to his parts below the waist, will remove the hair with
comfort. Now it is no drug, but a drastic dreg and a deadly
poison; for the Sultan of the Christians hath promised this obscene
fellow to release to him his wife and children, an he will kill thee;
for they are prisoners in the hands of that Sultan. I myself was
captive with him in their land, but I opened a dyery and dyed for
them various colours, so that they conciliated the King’s heart to
me and he bade me ask a boon of him. I sought of him freedom
and he set me at liberty, whereupon I made my way to this city
and seeing yonder man in the Hammam, said to him, “How didst
thou effect thine escape and win free with thy wife and children?”
Quoth he, “We ceased not to be in captivity, I and my wife and
children, till one day the King of the Nazarenes held a court
whereat I was present, amongst a number of others; and as I
stood amongst the folk, I heard them open out on the Kings and
name them, one after other, till they came to the name of the
King of this city, whereupon the King of the Christians cried
out Alas! and said, “None vexeth me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4255" id="noteref-4255" epub:type="noteref">4255</a> in the world, but the King
of such a city!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4256" id="noteref-4256" epub:type="noteref">4256</a> Whosoever will contrive me his slaughter I will
give him all he shall ask.” So I went up to him and said, “An
I compass for thee his slaughter, wilt thou set me free, me and my
wife and my children?” The King replied “Yes; and I will
give thee to boot whatso thou shalt desire.” So we agreed upon
this and he sent me in a galleon to this city, where I presented
myself to the King and he built me this Hammam. Now, therefore,
I have nought to do but to slay him and return to the King
of the Nazarenes, that I may redeem my children and my wife
and ask a boon of him.” Quoth I:—And how wilt thou go about
to kill him?; and quoth he:—By the simplest of all devices;
for I have compounded him somewhat wherein is poison; so, when
he cometh to the bath, I shall say to him:—Take this paste and
anoint therewith thy parts below the waist for it will cause the
hair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4257" id="noteref-4257" epub:type="noteref">4257</a> to drop off. So he will take it and apply it to himself and
the poison will work in him a day and a night, till it reacheth his
heart and destroyeth him; and meanwhile I shall have made
off and none will know that it was I slew him.” “When I
heard this,” added Abu Kir, “I feared for thee, my benefactor,
wherefore I have told thee of what is doing.” As soon as the
King heard the dyer’s story, he was wroth with exceeding wrath
and said to him, “Keep this secret.” Then he resolved to visit
the Hammam, that he might dispel doubt by supplying certainty;
and when he entered, Abu Sir doffed his dress and betaking
himself as of wont to the service of the King, proceeded to
glove him; after which he said to him, “O King of the age, I
have made a drug which assisteth in plucking out the lower
hair.” Cried the King, “Bring it to me”: so the barber brought
it to him and the King, finding it nauseous of smell, was assured
that it was poison; wherefore he was incensed and called out
to his guards, saying, “Seize him!” Accordingly they seized
him and the King donned his dress and returned to his palace,
boiling with fury, whilst none knew the cause of his indignation;
for, of the excess of his wrath he had acquainted no one therewith
and none dared ask him. Then he repaired to the audience-chamber
and causing Abu Sir to be brought before him, with his
elbows pinioned, sent for his Sea-captain and said to him, “Take
this villain and set him in a sack with two quintals of
lime unslacked and tie its mouth over his head. Then lay
him in a cock-boat and row out with him in front of my palace,
where thou wilt see me sitting at the lattice. Do thou say to
me:—Shall I cast him in? and if I answer, “Cast him!” throw
the sack into the sea, so the quicklime may be slaked on him
to the intent that he shall die drowned and burnt.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4258" id="noteref-4258" epub:type="noteref">4258</a> “Hearkening
and obeying;” quoth the Captain and taking Abu Sir from the
presence carried him to an island facing the King’s palace, where
he said to him, “Ho thou, I once visited thy Hammam and thou
entreatedst me with honour and accomplishedst all my needs and I
had great pleasure of thee: moreover, thou swarest that thou wouldst
take no pay of me, and I love thee with a great love. So tell me
how the case standeth between thee and the King and what
abominable deed thou hast done with him that he is wroth with thee
and hath commanded me that thou shouldst die this foul death.”
Answered Abu Sir, “I have done nothing, nor weet I of any crime
I have committed against him which meriteth this!”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<p>She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Sea-captain asked Abu Sir the cause of the King’s wrath with
him, he replied, “By Allah, O my brother I have committed no
crime against him which meriteth this!” Rejoined the Captain,
“Verily, thou wast high in rank with the King, such as none ever
won before thee, and all who are prosperous are envied. Haply
some one was jealous of thy good fortune and threw out certain
hints concerning thee to the King, by reason whereof he is become
enraged against thee with rage so violent: but be of good cheer;
no harm shall befal thee; for, even as thou entreatedst me
generously, without acquaintanceship between me and thee, so now
I will deliver thee. But, an if I release thee, thou must abide with
me on this island till some galleon sail from our city to thy native
land, when I will send thee thither therein.” Abu Sir kissed his
hand and thanked him for that; after which the Captain fetched
the quicklime and set it in a sack, together with a great stone, the
size of a man, saying, “I put my trust in Allah!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4259" id="noteref-4259" epub:type="noteref">4259</a> Then he gave
the barber a net, saying, “Cast this net into the sea, so haply
thou mayst take somewhat of fish. For I am bound to supply the
King’s kitchen with fish every day; but to-day I have been distracted
from fishing by this calamity which hath befallen thee, and
I fear lest the cook’s boys come to me in quest of fish and find
none. So, an thou take aught, they will find it and thou wilt veil
my face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4260" id="noteref-4260" epub:type="noteref">4260</a> whilst I go and play off my practice in front of the
palace and feign to cast thee into the sea.” Answered Abu Sir,
“I will fish the while; go thou and God help thee!” So the
Captain set the sack in the boat and paddled till he came under
the palace, where he saw the King seated at the lattice and said
to him, “O King of the age, shall I cast him in?” “Cast him!”
cried the King, and signed to him with his hand, when lo and
behold!; something flashed like leven and fell into the sea. Now
that which had fallen into the water was the King’s seal-ring;
and the same was enchanted in such way that, when the King
was wroth with any one and was minded to slay him, he had but
to sign to him with his right hand, whereon was the signet-ring,
and therefrom issued a flash of lightning, which smote the object,
and thereupon his head fell from between his shoulders; and the
troops obeyed him not, nor did he overcome the men of might
save by means of the ring. So, when it dropped from his finger,
he concealed the matter and kept silence, for that he dared not
say, “My ring is fallen into the sea,” for fear of the troops, lest
they rise against him and slay him. On this wise it befel the
King; but as regards Abu Sir, after the Captain had left him on
the island he took the net and casting it into the sea presently
drew it up full of fish; nor did he cease to throw it and pull it up
full, till there was a great mound of fish before him. So he said
in himself, “By Allah, this long while I have not eaten fish!”;
and chose himself a large fat fish, saying, “When the Captain
cometh back, I will bid him fry it for me, so I may dine on it.”
Then he cut its throat with a knife he had with him; but the
knife stuck in its gills and there he saw the King’s signet-ring;
for the fish had swallowed it and Destiny had driven it to that
island, where it had fallen into the net. He took the ring and
drew it on his little finger,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4261" id="noteref-4261" epub:type="noteref">4261</a> not knowing its peculiar properties.
Presently, up came two of the cook’s boys in quest of fish and
seeing Abu Sir, said to him, “O man, whither is the Captain
gone?” “I know not,” said he and signed to them with his
right hand; when, behold, the heads of both underlings dropped
off from between their shoulders. At this Abu Sir was amazed
and said, “Would I wot who slew them!” And their case was
grievous to him and he was still pondering it, when the Captain
suddenly returned and seeing the mound of fishes and two men
lying dead and the seal-ring on Abu Sir’s finger, said to him, “O
my brother, move not thy hand whereon is the signet-ring; else
thou wilt kill me.” Abu Sir wondered at this speech and kept
his hand motionless; whereupon the Captain came up to him and
said, “Who slew these two men?” “By Allah, O my brother I
wot not!” “Thou sayst sooth; but tell me whence hadst thou
that ring?” “I found it in this fish’s gills.” “True,” said the
Captain, “for I saw it fall flashing from the King’s palace and
disappear in the sea, what time he signed towards thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4262" id="noteref-4262" epub:type="noteref">4262</a> saying,
Cast him in. So I cast the sack into the water, and it was then
that the ring slipped from his finger and fell into the sea, where
this fish swallowed it, and Allah drave it to thee, so that thou
madest it thy prey, for this ring was thy lot; but kennest thou
its property?” Said Abu Sir, “I knew not that it had any
properties peculiar to it;” and the Captain said, “Learn, then,
that the King’s troops obey him not save for fear of this signet-ring,
because it is spelled, and when he was wroth with any one
and had a mind to kill him, he would sign at him therewith and
his head would drop from between his shoulders; for there issued
a flash of lightning from the ring and its ray smote the object
of his wrath, who died forthright.” At this, Abu Sir rejoiced
with exceeding joy and said to the Captain, “Carry me back to
the city;” and he said, “That will I, now that I no longer fear
for thee from the King; for, wert thou to sign at him with thy
hand, purposing to kill him, his head would fall down between
thy hands; and if thou be minded to slay him and all his host,
thou mayst slaughter them without let or hindrance.” So saying,
he embarked him in the boat and bore him back to the city;——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Captain embarked with Abu Sir he bore him back to the city, so
Abu Sir landed and going up to the palace, entered the council-chamber,
where he found the King seated facing his officers, in
sore cark and care by reason of the seal-ring and daring not tell
any of his folk anent its loss. When he saw Abu Sir, he said to
him, “Did we not cast thee into the sea? How hast thou contrived
to come forth of it?” Abu Sir replied, “O King of the
age, whenas thou badest throw me into the sea, thy Captain
carried me to an island and asked me of the cause of thy wrath
against me, saying:—What hast thou done with the King, that
he should decree thy death? I answered, By Allah, I know not
that I have wrought him any wrong! Quoth he:—Thou wast
high in rank with the King, and haply some one envied thee and
threw out certain hints concerning thee to him, so that he is
become incensed against thee. But when I visited thee in thy
Hammam, thou entreatedst me honourably, and I will requite
thee thy hospitality to me by setting thee free and sending thee
back to thine own land. Then he set a great stone in the sack
in my stead and cast it into the sea; but, when thou signedst to
him to throw me in, thy seal-ring dropped from thy finger into
the main, and a fish swallowed it. Now I was on the island
a-fishing, and this fish came up in the net with others; whereupon
I took it, intending to broil it; but, when I opened its belly,
I found the signet-ring therein; so I took it and put it on my
finger. Presently, up came two of the servants of the kitchen,
questing fish, and I signed to them with my hand, knowing not
the property of the seal-ring, and their heads fell off. Then the
Captain came back, and seeing the ring on my finger, acquainted
me with its spell; and behold, I have brought it back to thee,
for that thou dealtest kindly by me and entreatedst me with the
utmost honour, nor is that which thou hast done me of kindness
lost upon me. Here is thy ring; take it! But an I have done
with thee aught deserving of death, tell me my crime and slay
me and thou shalt be absolved of sin in shedding my blood.” So
saying, he pulled the ring from his finger and gave it to the King
who, seeing Abu Sir’s noble conduct, took the ring and put it on
and felt life return to him afresh. Then he rose to his feet and
embracing the barber, said to him, “O man, thou art indeed of
the flower of the well-born! Blame me not, but forgive me the
wrong I have done thee. Had any but thou gotten hold of this
ring, he had never restored it to me.” Answered Abu Sir, “O
King of the age, an thou wouldst have me forgive thee, tell me
what was my fault which drew down thine anger upon me, so
that thou commandedst to do me die.” Rejoined the King, “By
Allah, ’tis clear to me that thou art free and guiltless in all things
of offence since thou hast done this good deed; only the dyer
denounced thee to me in such and such words;” and he told him
all that Abu Kir had said. Abu Sir replied, “By Allah, O King
of the age, I know no King of the Nazarenes nor during my days
have ever journeyed to a Christian country, nor did it ever come
into my mind to kill thee. But this dyer was my comrade and
neighbour in the city of Alexandria where life was straitened
upon us; therefore we departed thence, to seek our fortunes, by
reason of the narrowness of our means at home, after we had
recited the Opening Chapter of the Koran together, pledging
ourselves that he who got work should feed him who lacked work;
and there befel me with him such and such things.” Then he
went on to relate to the King all that had betided him with Abu
Kir the dyer; how he had robbed him of his dirhams and had left
him alone and sick in the Khan-closet and how the door-keeper had
fed him of his own monies till Allah recovered him of his sickness,
when he went forth and walked about the city with his budget, as
was his wont, till he espied a dyery, about which the folk were
crowding; so he looked at the door and seeing Abu Kir seated on
a bench there, went in to salute him, whereupon he accused him
of being a thief and beat him a grievous beating; brief, he told
him his whole tale, from first to last, and added, “O King of the
age, ’twas he who counselled me to make the depilatory and
present it to thee, saying:—The Hammam is perfect in all
things but that it lacketh this; and know, O King of the age,
that this drug is harmless and we use it in our land where ’tis one
of the requisites of the bath; but I had forgotten it: so, when the
dyer visited the Hammam I entreated him with honour and he
reminded me of it, and enjoined me to make it forthwith. But
do thou send after the porter of such a Khan and the workmen
of the dyery and question them all of that which I have told
thee.” Accordingly the King sent for them and questioned them
one and all and they acquainted him with the truth of the matter.
Then he summoned the dyer, saying, “Bring him barefooted,
bareheaded and with elbows pinioned!” Now he was sitting in
his house, rejoicing in Abu Sir’s death; but ere he could be ware,
the King’s guards rushed in upon him and cuffed him on the nape,
after which they bound him and bore him into the presence, where
he saw Abu Sir seated by the King’s side and the door-keeper of
the Khan and workmen of the dyery standing before him. Quoth
the door-keeper to him, “Is not this thy comrade whom thou
robbedst of his silvers and leftest with me sick in the closet doing
such and such by him?” And the workmen said to him, “Is not
this he whom thou badest us seize and beat?” Therewith Abu
Kir’s baseness was made manifest to the King and he was certified
that he merited torture yet sorer than the torments of Munkar and
Nakír.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4263" id="noteref-4263" epub:type="noteref">4263</a> So he said to his guards, “Take him and parade him
about the city and the markets;”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">

    <div>Now when it was the Nine Hundred and Fortieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the King heard the words spoken by the door-keeper of the
Caravanserai and the workmen of the dyery, he was certified of
the vileness of Abu Kir; so he upbraided him with flout and fleer
and said to his guards, “Take him and parade him about the city
and the market-streets; then set him in a sack and cast him into
the sea.” Whereupon quoth Abu Sir, “O King of the age, accept
my intercession for him, for I pardon him all he hath done with
me.” But quoth the King, “An thou pardon him all his offences
against thee, I cannot pardon him his offences against me.” And
he cried out, saying, “Take him.” So they took him and paraded
him about the city, after which they set him in a sack with quicklime
and cast him into the sea, and he died, drowned and burnt.
Then said the King to the barber, “O Abu Sir, ask of me what
thou wilt and it shall be given thee.” And he answered, saying,
“I ask of thee to send me back to my own country, for I care no
longer to tarry here.” Then the King gifted him great store of
gifts, over and above that which he had whilome bestowed on
him; and amongst the rest a galleon freighted with goods; and
the crew of this galleon were Mamelukes; so he gave him these
also, after offering to make him his Wazir whereto the barber
consented not. Presently he farewelled the King and set sail in
his own ship manned by his own crew; nor did he cast anchor
till he reached Alexandria and made fast to the shore there.
Then they landed and one of his Mamelukes, seeing a sack on the
beach, said to Abu Sir, “O my lord, there is a great heavy sack
on the sea-shore, with the mouth tied up and I know not what
therein.” So Abu Sir came up and opening the sack, found
therein the remains of Abu Kir, which the sea had borne thither.
He took it forth and burying it near Alexandria, built over the
grave a place of visitation and endowed it with mortmain writing
over the door these couplets:—</p>

<p>After this Abu Sir abode awhile, till Allah took him to Himself,
and they buried him hard by the tomb of his comrade Abu Kir;
wherefore that place was called Abu Kir and Abu Sir; but it is
now known as Abu Kir only. This, then, is that which hath
reached us of their history, and glory be to Him who endureth
for ever and aye and by whose will interchange the night and the
