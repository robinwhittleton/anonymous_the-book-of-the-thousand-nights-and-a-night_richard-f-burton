			<p>Abu al-Aswad bought a native-born slave-girl, who was blind of an eye, and she pleased him; but his people decried her to him; whereat he wondered and, turning the palms of his hands upwards,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2187" id="noteref-2187" epub:type="noteref">2187</a> recited these two couplets:—</p>
