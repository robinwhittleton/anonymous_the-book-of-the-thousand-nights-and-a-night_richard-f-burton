			<h2 epub:type="title">The Two Sisters Who Envied Their Cadette<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6579" id="noteref-6579" epub:type="noteref">6579</a></h2>


<p>In days of yore and in times long gone before there lived a
King of Persia, Khusrau Sháh hight, renowned for justice and
righteousness. His father, dying at a good old age, had left him
sole heir to all the realm and, under his rule, the tiger and the
kid drank side by side at the same Ghát<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6580" id="noteref-6580" epub:type="noteref">6580</a>; and his treasury was
ever full and his troops and guards were numberless. Now it
was his wont to don disguise and, attended by a trusty Wazir, to
wander about the street at night-time. Whereby things seld-seen
and haps peregrine became known to him, the which, should
I tell thee all thereof, O auspicious King, would weary thee beyond
measure. So he took seat upon the throne of his forbears and
when the appointed days of mourning were ended, according to
the custom of that country, he caused his exalted name, that is
Khusrau Shah, be struck upon all the coins of the kingdom and
entered into the formula of public prayer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6581" id="noteref-6581" epub:type="noteref">6581</a> And when stablished
in his sovranty he went forth as aforetime on one evening accompanied
by his Grand Wazir, both in merchant’s habit, walking the
streets and squares, the markets and lanes, the better to note what
might take place both of good and of bad. By chance they passed,
as the night darkened, through a quarter where dwelt people of
the poorer class; and, as they walked on, the Shah heard inside
a house women talking with loud voices; then going near, he
peeped in by the door-chink, and saw three fair sisters who having
supped together were seated on a divan talking one to other.
The King thereupon applied his ear to the crack and listened
eagerly to what they said, and heard each and every declaring
what was the thing she most desired.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6582" id="noteref-6582" epub:type="noteref">6582</a> Quoth the eldest, “I would
I were married to the Shah’s head Baker for then should I ever have
bread to eat, the whitest and choicest in the city, and your hearts
would be fulfilled with envy and jealousy and malice at my good
luck.” Quoth the second, “I would rather wive with the Shah’s
chief Kitchener and eat of dainty dishes that are placed before his
Highness, wherewith the royal bread which is common throughout
the Palace cannot compare for gust and flavour.” And quoth the
third and youngest of the three, and by far the most beautiful and
lovely of them all, a maiden of charming nature, full of wit and
humour; sharp-witted, wary and wise, when her turn came to tell
her wish, “O sisters, my ambition is not as ordinary as yours. I
care not for fine bread nor glutton-like do I long for dainty dishes.
I look to somewhat nobler and higher: indeed I would desire
nothing less than to be married by the King and become the
mother of a beautiful Prince, a model of form and in mind as
masterful as valorous. His hair should be golden on one side and
silvern on the other: when weeping he should drop pearls in place
of tears, and when laughing his rosy lips should be fresh as the
blossom new-blown.” The Shah was amazed with exceeding
amazement to hear the wishes of the three sisters, but chiefly of
the youngest and determined in himself that he would gratify
them all. Wherefore quoth he to the Grand Wazir, “Mark well
this house and on the morrow bring before me these maidens
whom we heard discoursing;” and quoth the Wazir, “O Asylum
of the Universe, I hear but to obey.” Thereupon the twain
walked back to the palace and laid them down to rest. When
morning morrowed, the Minister went for the sisters and brought
them to the King, who, after greeting them and heartening their
hearts, said to them in kindly tone, “O ye maidens of weal, last
night what was it that in merry word and jest ye spake one to
other? Take heed ye tell the Shah every whit in full detail, for
all must become known to us; something have we heard, but now
the King would have ye recount your discourse to his royal ears.”——And
as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that at these
words of the Shah the sisters, confused and filled with shame,
durst not reply but stood before him silent with heads bent
low; and despite all questioning and encouragement they could
not pluck up courage. However, the youngest was of passing
comeliness in form and feature and forthwith the Shah became
desperately enamoured of her; and of his love began reassuring
them and saying, “O ye Princesses of fair ones, be not afraid nor
troubled in thought; nor let bashfulness or shyness prevent you
telling the Shah what three wishes you wished, for fain would he
fulfil them all.” Thereat they threw themselves at his feet and,
craving his pardon for their boldness and freedom of speech,
told him the whole talk, each one repeating the wish she had
wished; and on that very day Khusrau Shah married the eldest
sister to his chief Baker, and the second sister to his head Cook,
and bade make all things ready for his own wedding with the
youngest sister. So when the preparations for the royal nuptials
had been made after costliest fashion, the King’s marriage was
celebrated with royal pomp and pageantry, and the bride received
the titles of Light of the Harem and Bánú of Irán-land. The
other two maidens were likewise married, one to the King’s Baker
the other to his Cook, after a manner according to their several
degrees in life and with little show of grandeur and circumstance.
Now it had been only right and reasonable that these twain
having won each her own wish, should have passed their time in
solace and happiness, but the decree of Destiny doomed otherwise;
and, as soon as they saw the grand estate whereto their youngest
sister had risen, and the magnificence of her marriage-festival,
their hearts were fired with envy and jealousy and sore despite
and they resolved upon giving the rein to their hatred and malignancy
and to work her some foul mischief. On this wise they
remained for many months consumed with rancour, day and night;
and they burned with grief and anger whenever they sighted aught
of her superior style and state. One morning as the two met at
the Hammám and found privacy and opportunity, quoth the eldest
sister to the second, “A grievous thing it is indeed that she, our
youngest sister, no lovelier than ourselves, should thus be raised
to the dignity and majesty of Queendom and indeed the thought
is overhard to bear.” Quoth the other, “O sister mine, I also am
perplexed and displeased at this thing, and I know not what of
merit the Shah could have seen in her that he was tempted to
choose her for his consort. She ill befitteth that high estate with
that face like a monkey’s favour; and, save her youth, I know
nothing that could commend her to his Highness that he should
so exalt her above her fellows. To my mind thou and not she art
fit to share the royal bed; and I nurse a grudge against the King
for that he hath made this jade his Queen.” And the eldest
sister rejoined, “I likewise marvel beyond all measure; and I
swear that thy youth and beauty, thy well-shaped figure and lovely
favour and goodliness of gifts past challenge or compare, might
well have sufficed to win the King and have tempted him to wed
and bed with thee and make thee his crowned Queen and Sovran
Lady in lieu of taking to his arms this paltry strumpet. Indeed
he hath shown no sense of what is right and just in leaving thee
disappointed; and on this account only the matter troubleth me
with exceeding trouble.”——And as the morn began to dawn
Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
two sisters took counsel each with other how they might abase
their youngest sister in the Shah’s sight and cause her downfall
and utter ruin. Day and night they conned over the matter in
their minds and spoke at great length about it when they ever
met together, and pondered endless plans to injure the Queen
their sister, and if possible bring about her death; but they
could fix upon none. And, whilst they bore this despite and
hatred towards her and diligently and deliberately sought the
means of gratifying their bitter envy, hatred and malice, she on
the other hand regarded them with the same favour and affection
as she had done before marriage and thought only how to
advantage their low estate. Now when some months of her
wedded life had passed, the fair Queen was found to be with child
whereof the glad tidings filled the Shah with joy; and straightway
he commanded all the people of the capital and throughout the
whole Empire keep holiday with feasts and dancing and every
manner jollity as became so rare and important an occasion. But
as soon as the news came to the ears of the two Envious Sisters
they were constrained perforce to offer their congratulations to the
Queen; and, after a long visit, as the twain were about to crave
dismissal they said, “Thanks be to Almighty Allah, O our sister,
who hath shown us this happy day. One boon have we to ask of
thee: to wit, that when the time shall come for thee to be delivered
of a child, we may assist as midwives at thy confinement, and be
with thee and nurse thee for the space of forty days.” The Queen
in her gladness made reply, “O sisters mine, I fain would have it
so; for at a time of such need I know of none on whom to rely
with such dependence as upon you. During my coming trial your
presence with me will be most welcome and opportune; but I can
do only what thing the Shah biddeth nor can I do aught save by
his leave. My advice is thus:—Make known this matter to your
mates who have always access to the royal presence, and let them
personally apply for your attendance as midwives; I doubt not but
that the Shah will give you leave to assist me and remain by my
side, considering the fond relationship between us three.” Then
the two sisters returned home full of evil thoughts and malice,
and told their wishes to their husbands who, in turn, bespake
Khusrau Shah, and proffered their petition with all humility, little
knowing what was hidden from them in the Secret Purpose. The
King replied, “When I shall have thought the matter over in my
mind, I will give you suitable orders.” So saying he privately
visited the Queen and to her said, “O my lady, an it please
thee, methinks ’twould be well to summon thy sisters and secure
their aidance, when thou shalt be labouring of child, in lieu of any
stranger: and if thou be of the same mind as myself let me at once
learn and take steps to obtain their consent and concert ere thy
time arriveth. They will wait on thee with more loving care than
any hired nurse and thou wilt find thyself the safer in their hands.”
Replied the Queen, “O my lord the Shah, I also venture to think
that ’twould be well to have my sisters by my side and not mere
aliens at such an hour.” Accordingly he sent word to them and
from that day they dwelt within the palace to make all ready for
the expected confinement; and on this wise they found means to
carry out their despiteful plot which during so many days they had
devised to scanty purpose. When her full tale of months had
been told, the Banu was brought to bed of a man-child marvellous
in beauty, whereat the fire of envy and hatred was kindled
with redoubled fury in the sisters’ breasts. So they again took
counsel nor suffered ruth or natural affection to move their cruel
hearts; and presently, with great care and secrecy, they wrapped
the new-born in a bit of blanket and putting him into a basket
cast him into a canal which flowed hard by the Queen’s apartment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6583" id="noteref-6583" epub:type="noteref">6583</a>
They then placed a dead puppy in the place of the prince and
showed it to the other midwives and nurses, averring that the
Queen had given birth to such abortion. When these untoward
tidings reached the King’s ears he was sore discomforted and
waxed wroth with exceeding wrath.——And as the morn began
to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Seventieth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
King, inflamed with sudden fierceness, drew his sword and would
have slain his Queen had not the Grand Wazir, who happened
to be in his presence at the time, restrained his rage and diverted
him from his unjust design and barbarous purpose. Quoth he,
“O Shadow of Allah upon earth, this mishap is ordained of the
Almighty Lord whose will no man hath power to gainsay. The
Queen is guiltless of offence against thee, for what is born of her
is born without her choice, and she indeed hath no hand therein.”
With this and other sage counsels he dissuaded his lord from
carrying out his fell purpose and saved the guiltless Queen from a
sudden and cruel death. Meanwhile the basket wherein lay the
newly-born Prince was carried by the current into a rivulet which
flowed through the royal gardens; and, as the Intendant of the
pleasure grounds and pleasaunces chanced to walk along the bank,
by the decree of Destiny he caught sight of the basket floating
by, and he called a gardener, bidding him lay hold of it and bring
it to him that he might see what was therein. The man ran along
the rivulet side; and, with a long stick drawing the basket to land,
showed it to the Intendant who opened it and beheld within a
new-born babe, a boy of wondrous beauty wrapped in a bit of
blanket; at which sight he was astounded beyond measure of
surprise. Now it so chanced that the Intendant, who was one of
the Emirs and who stood high in favour with the Sovran, had no
children: withal he never ceased offering prayers and vows to
Almighty Allah that he might have a son to keep alive his
memory and continue his name. Delighted at the sight he took
home the basket with the babe and giving it to his wife said, “See
how Allah hath sent to us this man-child which I just now found
floating upon the waters; and do thou apply thee forthright and
fetch a wet-nurse to give him milk and nourish him; and bring him
up with care and tenderness as though he were thine own.” So
the Intendant’s wife took charge of the child with great gladness
and reared him with her whole heart, diligently as though born of
her own womb; nor did the Intendant say aught to any, or seek
to find out whose might be the child lest haply some one claim
and take it from him. He was certified in his mind that the boy
came from the Queen’s quarter of the palace, but deemed it inexpedient
to make too strict enquiry concerning the matter; and
he and his spouse kept the secret with all secrecy. A year after
this the Queen gave birth to a second son, when her sisters, the
Satanesses full of spite, did with this babe, even as they had done
by the first: they wrapped it in a cloth and set it in a basket
which they threw into the stream, then gave out that the Queen
had brought forth a kitten. But once more, by the mercy of
Allah Almighty, this boy came to the hands of that same Intendant
of the gardens who carried him to his wife and placed him
under her charge with strict injunctions to take care of the second
foundling sedulously as she had done with the first. The Shah,
enraged to hear the evil tidings, again rose up to slay the Queen; but
as before the Grand Wazir prevented him and calmed his wrath with
words of wholesome rede and a second time saved the unhappy
mother’s life. And after another year had gone by the Banu was
brought to bed and this time bore a daughter by whom the sisters
did as they had done by her brothers: they set the innocent inside
a basket and threw her into the stream; and the Intendant found
her also and took her to his wife and bade her rear the infant
together with the other two castaways. Hereupon the Envious
Sisters, wild with malice, reported that the Queen had given birth
to a musk-ratling;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6584" id="noteref-6584" epub:type="noteref">6584</a> whereat King Khusrau could no longer stay
his wrath and indignation. So he cried in furious rage to the
Grand Wazir, “What, shall the Shah suffer this woman, who
beareth naught but vermin and abortions, to share the joys
of his bed? Nay more, the King can no longer allow her to live,
else she will fill the palace with monstrous births: in very sooth,
she is herself a monster, and it behoveth us to rid this place of
such unclean creature and accursed.” So saying the Shah commanded
them do her to death; but the ministers and high officers
of estate who stood before the presence fell at the royal feet and
besought pardon and mercy for the Queen. The Grand Wazir
also said with folded hands, “O Sháhinsháh<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6585" id="noteref-6585" epub:type="noteref">6585</a>—O King of the
kings—thy slave would fain represent that ’tis not in accordance
with the course of justice or the laws of the land to take the life
of a woman for no fault of her own. She cannot interfere with
Destiny, nor can she prevent unnatural births such as have thrice
betided her; and such mishaps have oftentimes befallen other
women, whose cases call for compassion and not punishment. An
the King be displeased with her then let him cease to live with
her, and the loss of his gracious favour will be a penalty dire
enough; and, if the Shah cannot suffer the sight of her, then let
her be confined in some room apart, and let her expiate her offence
by alms deeds and charity until ’Izráíl, the Angel of Death,
separate her soul from her flesh.” Hearing these words of counsel
from his aged Councillor, Khusrau Shah recognised that it had
been wrong to slay the Queen, for that she could on no wise do
away with aught that was determined by Fate and Destiny; and
presently he said to the Grand Wazir, “Her life is spared at thine
intercession, O wise man and ware; yet will the King doom her to
a weird which, haply, is hardly less hard to bear than death. And
now do thou forthright make ready, by the side of the Cathedral-mosque,
a wooden cage with iron bars and lock the Queen therein
as one would confine a ferocious wild beast.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6586" id="noteref-6586" epub:type="noteref">6586</a> Then every Mussulman
who wendeth his way to public prayers shall spit in her face
ere he set foot within the fane, and if any fail to carry out this
command he shall be punished in like manner. So place guards
and inspectors to enforce obedience and let me hear if there be
aught of gainsaying.” The Wazir durst not make reply but
carried out the Shah’s commandments; and this punishment inflicted
upon the blameless Queen had far better befitted her
Envious Sisters.——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held
her peace till</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Seventy-first Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the cage
was made ready with all speed; and, when the forty days after
purification of child-bed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6587" id="noteref-6587" epub:type="noteref">6587</a> had come to an end, the Banu was locked
therein; and, according to the King’s commandment, all who came
to prayer in the Great Mosque would first spit in her face. The
hapless woman, well knowing that she was not worthy of this
ignominy, bore her sufferings with all patience and fortitude; nor
were they few who deemed her blameless and undeserving to
endure these torments and tortures inflicted upon her by the Shah;
and they pitied her and offered prayers and made vows for her
release. Meanwhile the Intendant of the gardens and his wife
brought up the two Princes and the Princess with all love and
tenderness; and, as the children grew in years, their love for these
adopted ones increased in like proportion. They gave the eldest
Prince the name Bahman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6588" id="noteref-6588" epub:type="noteref">6588</a> and to his brother Parwez;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6589" id="noteref-6589" epub:type="noteref">6589</a> and, as
the maiden was rare of beauty and passing of loveliness and graciousness,
they called her Perízádah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6590" id="noteref-6590" epub:type="noteref">6590</a> When the Princes became
of years to receive instruction, the Intendant of the gardens
appointed tutors and masters to teach them reading and writing
and all the arts and sciences: the Princess also, showing like
eagerness to acquire knowledge, was taught letters by the same
instructors, and soon could read and write with as perfect fluency
and facility as could her brothers. Then they were placed under
the most learned of the Philosophers and the Olema, who taught
them the interpretation of the Koran and the sayings of the
Apostle; the science of geometry as well as poetry and history,
and even the abstruse sciences and the mystic doctrines of the
Enlightened; and their teachers were astonished to find how soon
and how far all three made progress in their studies and bid fair
to outstrip even the sages however learned. Moreover, they all
three were reared to horsemanship and skill in the chase, to shooting
with shafts and lunging with lance and sway of sabre and jerking
the Jeríd, with other manly and warlike sports. Besides all this
the Princess Perizadah was taught to sing and play on various
instruments of mirth and merriment, wherein she became the
peerless pearl of her age and time. The Intendant was exceeding
glad of heart to find his adopted children prove themselves such
proficients in every branch of knowledge; and presently, forasmuch
as his lodging was small and unfit for the growing family,
he bought at a little distance from the city a piece of land
sufficiently large to contain fields and meadows and copses. Here
he fell to building a mansion of great magnificence; and busied
himself day and night with supervising the architects and masons
and other artificers. He adorned the walls inside and out with
sculptural work of the finest and paintings of the choicest, and he
fitted every apartment with richest furniture. In the front of his
mansion he bade lay out a garden and stocked it with scented
flowers and fragrant shrubs and fruit trees whose produce was as
that of Paradise. There was moreover a large park girt on all
sides by a high wall wherein he reared game, both fur and feather,
as sport for the two Princes and their sister. And when the mansion
was finished and fit for habitation, the Intendant, who had faithfully
served the Shah for many generations of men, craved leave
of his lord that he might bid adieu to the city and take up his
abode in his new country seat; and the King, who had always
looked upon him with the eye of favour, granted to him the
required boon right heartily; furthermore, to prove his high
opinion of his old servant and his services, he inquired of him if
he had aught to request that it might be granted to him. Replied
the other, “O my liege lord, thy slave desireth naught save that he
may spend the remnant of his days under the shadow of the Shah’s
protection, with body and soul devoted to his service, even as I
served the sire before the son.” The Shah dismissed him with
words of thanks and comfort, when he left the city and taking with
him the two Princes and their sister, he carried them to his newly-built
mansion. Some years before this time his wife had departed
to the mercy of Allah, and he had passed only five or six months
in his second home when he too suddenly fell sick and was
admitted into the number of those who have found ruth. Withal
he had neglected every occasion of telling his three foundlings
the strange tale of their birth and how he had carried them to his
home as castaways and had reared them as rearlings and had
cherished them as his own children. But he had time to charge
them, ere he died, that they three should never cease to live
together in love and honour and affection and respect one towards
other. The loss of their protector caused them to grieve with
bitter grief, for they all thought he was their real father; so they
bewailed them and buried him as befitted; after which the two
brothers and their sister dwelt together in peace and plenty. But
one day of the days the Princes, who were full of daring and of
highest mettle, rode forth a-hunting and Princess Perizadah was
left alone at home when an ancient woman——And as the morn
began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Seventy-second Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that perchance
an ancient woman of the Moslems, a recluse and a devotee
came to the door and begged leave to enter within and repeat her
prayers, as it was then the canonical hour and she had but time
to make the Wuzú-ablution. Perizadah bade bring her and
saluted her with the salam and kindly welcomed her; then, when
the holy woman had made an end of her orisons, the handmaids of
the Princess, at her command, conducted her all through the house
and grounds, and displayed to her the rooms with their furniture and
fittings, and lastly the garden and orchard and game-park. She
was well pleased with all she saw and said within herself, “The
man who built this mansion and laid out these parterres and
vergiers was verily an accomplished artist and a wight of marvellous
skill.” At last the slaves led her back to the Princess who,
awaiting her return, was sitting in the belvedere; and quoth she
to the devotee, “Come, O good my mother, do thou sit beside me
and make me happy by the company of a pious recluse whom I
am fortunate enough to have entertained unawares, and suffer I
listen to thy words of grace and thereby gain no small advantage
in this world and the next. Thou hast chosen the right path and
straight whereon to walk, and that which all men strive for and
pine for.” The holy woman would fain have seated herself at the
feet of the Princess, but she courteously arose and took her by the
hand and constrained her to sit beside her. Quoth she, “O my
lady, mine eyes never yet beheld one so well-mannered as thou
art: indeed, I am unworthy to sit with thee, natheless, as thou
biddest, I will e’en do thy bidding.” As they sat conversing each
with other the slave-girls set before them a table whereon were
placed some platters of bread and cakes with saucers full of fruits
both fresh and dried, and various kinds of cakes and sweetmeats.
The Princess took one of the cakes and giving it to the good
woman said, “O my mother, refresh thyself herewith and eat of the
fruits such as thou likest. ’Tis now long since thou didst leave thy
home and I trow thou hast not tasted aught of food upon the
road.” Replied the holy woman, “O lady of gentle birth, I am
not wont to taste of dainty dishes such as these, but I can ill
refuse thy provision, since Allah the Almighty deigneth send me
food and support by so liberal and generous a hand as thine.”
And when they twain had eaten somewhat and cheered their
hearts, the Princess asked the devotee concerning the manner of
her worship and of her austere life; whereto she made due answer
and explained according to her knowledge. The Princess then
exclaimed, “Tell me, I pray thee, what thou thinkest of this
mansion and the fashion of its building and the furniture and the
appurtenances; and say me is all perfect and appropriate, or is
aught still lacking in mansion or garden?” And she replied,
“Since thou deignest ask my opinion, I confess to thee that both the
building and the parterres are finished and furnished to perfection;
and the belongings are in the best of taste and in the highest of ordinance.
Still to my thinking there be three things here wanting, which
if thou hadst the place would be most complete.” The Princess
Perizadah adjured her saying, “O my aunt, I beseech thee tell me
what three articles yet are lacking, that I may lose nor pains nor
toil to obtain them;” and, as the maiden pressed her with much
entreaty, the devotee was constrained to tell her. Quoth she, “O
gentle lady, the first thing is the Speaking-Bird, called Bulbul-i-hazár-dástán;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6591" id="noteref-6591" epub:type="noteref">6591</a>
he is very rare and hard to find but, whenever he
poureth out his melodious notes, thousands of birds fly to him
from every side and join him in his harmony. The next thing is
the Singing-Tree, whose smooth and glossy leaves when shaken by
the wind and rubbed one against other send forth tuneful tones
which strike the ear like the notes of sweet-voiced minstrels,
ravishing the hearts of all who listen. The third thing is the
Golden-Water of transparent purity, whereof should but one drop
be dripped into a basin and this be placed inside the garden it
presently will fill the vessel brimful and will spout upwards in
gerbes playing like a fountain that jets: moreover it never ceaseth
plying, and all the water as it shooteth up falleth back again
inside the basin, not one gout thereof being lost.” Replied the
Princess, “I doubt not but thou knowest for a certainty the very
spot where these wondrous things are to be found; and I pray
thee tell me now the place and means whereby I may take action
to obtain them.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad
held her peace till</p>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
holy woman thus answered the Princess, “These three rarities are
not to be found, save on the boundary-line that lieth between the
land of Hind and the confining countries, a score of marches along
the road that leadeth Eastwards from this mansion. Let him who
goeth forth in quest of them ask the first man he meeteth on the
twentieth stage concerning the spot where he may find the Speaking-Bird,
the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water; and he will direct
the seeker where to come upon all three.” When she had made
an end of speaking the Devotee, with many blessings and prayers
and vows for her well-being, farewelled the lady Perizadah and
fared forth homewards. The Princess, however, ceased not to
ponder her words and ever to dwell in memory upon the relation
of the holy woman who, never thinking that her hostess had asked
for information save by way of curiosity, nor really purposed in
mind to set forth with intent of finding the rarities, had heedlessly
told all she knew and had given a clue to the discovery. But
Perizadah kept these matters deeply graven on the tablets of her
heart with firm resolution to follow the directions and, by all
means in her power, to gain possession of these three wonders.
Withal, the more she reflected the harder appeared the enterprise,
and her fear of failing only added to her unease. Now whilst she
sat perplexed with anxious thought and anon terrified with sore
affright, her brothers rode back from the hunting-ground; and they
marvelled much to see her sad of semblance and low-spirited,
wondering the while what it was that troubled her. Presently
quoth Prince Bahman, “O sister mine, why art thou so heavy of
heart this day? Almighty Allah forbid thou be ill in health or
that aught have betided thee to cause thy displeasure or to make
thee melancholy. Tell us I beseech thee what it is, that we may
be sharers in thy sorrow and be alert to aid thee.” The Princess
answered not a word, but after long silence raised her head and
looked up at her brothers; then casting down her eyes she said in
curt phrase that naught was amiss with her. Quoth Prince
Bahman, “Full well I wot that there is a somewhat on thy mind
which thou hesitatest to tell us; and now hear me swear a strong
oath that I will never leave thy side till thou shalt have told us
what cause it is that troubleth thee. Haply thou art aweary of
our affection and thou wouldst undo the fraternal tie which hath
united us from our infancy.” When she saw her brothers so distressed
and distraught, she was compelled to speak and said,
“Albeit, O my dearlings, to tell you wherefore I am sad and
sorrowful may cause you grief, still there is no help but I explain
the matter to you twain. This mansion, which our dear father (who
hath found ruth) builded for us, is perfect in every attribute nor
lacketh it any condition of comfort or completion. Howbeit I
have found out by chance this day that there are yet three things
which, were they set within these walls, of the house and grounds,
would make our place beyond compare, and in the wide world
there would be naught with it to pair. These three things are the
Speaking-Bird and the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water; and
ever since I heard of them my heart is filled with extreme desire
to place them within our domain and excessive longing to obtain
them by any means within my power. It now behoveth you help
me with your best endeavour and to consider what person will aid
me in getting possession of these rarities.” Replied Prince Bahman,
“My life and that of my brother are at thy service to carry out
thy purpose with heart and soul; and, couldst thou give me but
a clue to the place where these strange things are found, I would
sally forth in quest of them at daybreak as soon as the morning
shall morrow.” When Prince Parwez understood that his brother
was about to make this journey, he spake saying, “O my brother,
thou art eldest of us, so do thou stay at home while I go forth to
seek for these three things and bring them to our sister. And
indeed it were more fitting for me to undertake a task which may
occupy me for years.” Replied Prince Bahman, “I have full confidence
in thy strength and prowess, and whatso I am able to
perform thou canst do as well as I can. Still it is my firm
resolve to fare forth upon this adventure alone and unaided, and
thou must stay and take care of our sister and our home.” So
next day Prince Bahman learned from the Princess the road
whereon he was to travel and the marks and signs whereby to find
the place. Presently, he donned armour and arms and bidding the
twain adieu, he took horse and was about to ride forth with the
stoutest of hearts, whereat Princess Perizadah’s eyes brimmed with
tears and in faltering accents she addressed him saying, “O dear
my brother, this bitter separation is heart-breaking; and sore
sorrowful am I to see thee part from us. This disunion and thine
absence in a distant land cause me grief and woe far exceeding
that wherewith I mourned and pined for the rarities wherefor thou
quittest us. If only we might have some news of thee from day to
day then would I feel somewhat comforted and consoled; but now
’tis clear otherwise and regret is of none avail.”——And as the
morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that Prince
Bahman made answer in these words: “O sister mine, I am
fully determined in mind to attempt this derring-do: be thou
not however anxious or alarmed, for Inshallah—God willing—I
shall return successful and triumphant. After my departure
shouldst thou at any time feel in fear for my safety, then by
this token which I leave thee thou shalt know of my fate and
lot, good or evil.” Then, drawing from his waist-shawl a little
hunting-knife like a whittle, he gave it to Princess Perizadah,
saying, “Take now this blade and keep it ever by thee; and
shouldst thou at any day or hour be solicitous concerning my
condition, draw it from its sheath; and, if the steel be clean and
bright as ’tis now then know that I am alive and safe and sound;
but an thou find stains of blood thereon then shalt thou know
that I am slain, and naught remaineth for thee to do save to
pray for me as for one dead.” With these words of solace the
Prince departed on his journey, and travelled straight along the
road to India, turning nor to right hand nor to left but ever
keeping the same object in view. Thus a score of days was
spent in journeying from the land of Iran, and upon the twentieth
he reached the end of his travel. Here he suddenly sighted
an ancient man of frightful aspect sitting beneath a tree hard
by his thatched hut wherein he was wont to shelter himself from
the rains of spring and the heats of summer and the autumnal
miasmas and the wintry frosts. So shotten in years was this
Shaykh that hair and beard, mustachios and whiskers were white
as snow, and the growth of his upper lip was so long and so
thick that it covered and concealed his mouth, while his beard
swept the ground and the nails of his hands and feet had grown
to resemble the claws of a wild beast. Upon his head he wore a
broad-brimmed hat of woven palm-leaves like that of a Malábár
fisherman, and all his remaining habit was a strip of matting
girded around his waist. Now this Shaykh was a Darwaysh
who for many years had fled the world and all worldly pleasures;
who lived a holy life of poverty and chastity and other-worldliness
whereby his semblance had become such as I, O auspicious King,
have described to thee. From early dawn that day Prince Bahman
had been watchful and vigilant, ever looking on all sides to descry
some one who could supply him with information touching the
whereabouts of the rarities he sought; and this was the first human
being he had sighted on that stage, the twentieth and last of his
journey. So he rode up to him, being assured that the Shaykh
must be the wight of whom the holy woman had spoken. Then
Prince Bahman dismounting and making low obeisance to the
Darwaysh, said, “O my father, Allah Almighty prolong thy years
and grant thee all thy wishes!” Whereto the Fakir made answer
but in accents so indistinct that the Prince could not distinguish a
single word he said; and presently Bahman understood that his
moustache had on such wise closed and concealed his mouth
that his utterance became indistinct and he only muttered when
he would have spoken. He therefore haltered his horse to a tree
and pulling out a pair of scissors said, “O holy man, thy lips are
wholly hidden by this overlong hair; suffer me, I pray thee,
clip the bristling growth which overspreadeth thy face and which
is so long and thick that thou art fearsome to behold; nay, more
like to a bear than to a human being.” The Darwaysh with a nod
consented, and when the Prince had clipped it and trimmed the
growth, his face once more looked young and fresh as that of a
man in the prime of youth. Presently quoth Bahman to him,
“Would Heaven I had a mirror wherein to show thee thy face,
so wouldst thou see how youthful thou seemest, and how thy
favour hath become far more like that of folk than whilom it
was.” These flattering words pleased the Darwaysh who smiling
said, “I thank thee much for this thy goodly service and kindly
offices; and, if in return I can do aught of favour for thee, I pray
thee let me know, and I will attempt to satisfy thee in all things
with my very heart and soul.” Then said the Prince, “O holy
man, I have come hither from far distant lands along a toilsome
road in quest of three things; to wit, a certain Speaking-Bird,
a Singing-Tree and a Golden-Water; and this know I for certain
that they are all to be found hard by this site.”——And as the
morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Prince, turning to the Darwaysh, continued, “O Devotee, albeit
well I wot that the three things I seek are in this land and nearhand,
yet I know not the exact spot wherein to find them. An
thou have true information concerning the place and will inform
me thereof, I on my part will never forget thy kindness, and I
shall have the satisfaction of feeling that this long and toilsome
wayfare hath not been wholly vain.” Hearing these words of
the Prince, the Darwaysh changed countenance and his face waxed
troubled and his colour wan; then he bent his glance downwards
and sat in deepest silence. Whereat the other said, “O holy
father, dost thou not understand the words wherewith I have
bespoken thee? An thou art ignorant of the matter prithee let
me know straightway that I may again fare onwards until such
time as I find a man who can inform me thereof.” After a long
pause the Darwaysh made reply, “O stranger, ’tis true I ken
full well the site whereof thou art in search; but I hold thee
dear in that thou hast been of service to me; and I am loath
for thine own sake to tell thee where to find that stead.” And
the Prince rejoined, “Say me, O Fakir, why dost thou withhold
this knowledge from me, and wherefore art thou not lief to let
me learn it?” Replied the other, “’Tis a hard road to travel
and full of perils and dangers. Besides thyself many have come
hither and have asked the path of me, and I refused to tell
them, but they heeded not my warning and pressed me sore and
compelled me to disclose the secret which I would have buried
in my breast. Know, O my son, that all those braves have
perished in their pride and not one of them hath returned to
me safe and sound. Now, an thy life be dear to thee, follow my
counsel and fare no further, but rather turn thee back without
stay or delay and make for house and home and family.” Hereto
Prince Bahman, stern in resolution, made reply, “Thou hast
after kindly guise and friendly fashion advised me with the best
of advice; and I, having heard all thou hast to say, do thank
thee gratefully. But I reck not one jot or tittle of what dangers
affront me, nor shall thy threats however fatal deter me from
my purpose: moreover, if thieves or foemen haply fall upon me,
I am armed at point and can and will protect myself, for I am
certified that none can outvie me in strength and stowre.” To
this the Fakir made reply, “The beings who will cut thy path
and bar thy progress to that place are unseen of man, nor will
they appear to thee on any wise: how then canst thou defend
thyself against them?” And he replied, “So be it, still I fear
not and I pray thee only show me the road thither.” When
the Darwaysh was assured that the Prince had fully determined
in mind to attempt the exploit and would by no means turn or
be turned back from carrying out his purpose, he thrust his hand
into a bag which lay hard by and took therefrom a ball, and said,
“Alas, O my son, thou wilt not accept my counsel and I needs
must let thee follow thy wilful way. Take this ball and, mounting
thy horse, throw it in front of thee, and as long as it shall roll
onwards do thou ride after it, but when it shall stop at the
hill-foot dismount from thy horse and throw the reins upon his
neck and leave him alone, for he will stay there without moving
until such time as thou return. Then manfully breast the ascent,
and on either side of the path, right and left, thou shalt see a
scatter of huge black boulders. Here the sound of many voices
in confused clamour and frightful will suddenly strike thine
ears, to raise thy wrath and to fill thee with fear and hinder thy
higher course uphill. Have a heed that thou be not dismayed,
also beware, and again I say beware, lest thou turn thy head
at any time and cast a look backwards. An thy courage fail
thee, or thou allow thyself one glance behind thee, thou shalt be
transformed that very moment into a black rock; for know thou,
O Prince, that all those stones which thou shalt see strewn upon
thy way were men whilom and braves like thyself, who went forth
with intent to gain the three things thou seekest, but frightened at
those sounds lost human shape and became black boulders. However,
shouldst thou reach the hill-top safe and sound, thou
shalt find on the very summit a cage and perched therein the
Speaking-Bird ready to answer all thy queries. So ask of him
where thou mayest find the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water,
and he will tell thee all thou requirest. When thou shalt safely
have seized all three thou wilt be free from further danger;
yet, inasmuch as thou hast not yet set out upon this journey
give ear to my counsel. I beg of thee desist from this thy purpose
and return home in peace whilst thou hast yet the power.”——And

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Prince made answer to the Darwaysh, “Until, O thou holy man,
such time as I win to my purpose I will not go back; no, never;
therefore adieu.” So he mounted his horse and threw the ball in
front of him; and it rolled forward at racing-speed and he, with
gaze intent thereupon, rode after it and did not suffer it to gain
upon him. When it had reached the hill whereof the Darwaysh
spake, it ceased to make further way, whereupon the Prince dismounted
and throwing the reins on his horse’s neck left him and
fared on afoot to the slope. As far as he could see, the line of his
path from the hill-foot to the head was strewn with a scatter of
huge black boulders; withal his heart felt naught of fear. He had
not taken more than some four or five paces before a hideous din
and a terrible hubbub of many voices arose, even as the Darwaysh
had forewarned him. Prince Bahman, however, walked on valiantly
with front erect and fearless tread, but he saw no living thing and
heard only the Voices<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6592" id="noteref-6592" epub:type="noteref">6592</a> sounding all around him. Some said, “Who
is yon fool man and whence hath he come? Stop him, let him
not pass!” Others shouted out, “Fall on him, seize this zany and
slay him!” Then the report waxed louder and louder still, likest
to the roar of thunder, and many Voices yelled out, “Thief!
Assassin! Murtherer!” Another muttered in taunting undertones,
“Let him be, fine fellow that he is! Suffer him to pass on, for he
and he only shall get the cage and the Speaking-Bird.” The Prince
feared naught but advanced hot foot with his wonted nerve and
spirit; presently, however, when the Voices kept approaching nearer
and nearer to him and increased in number on every side, he was
sore perplexed. His legs began to tremble, he staggered and in
fine overcome by fear he clean forgot the warning of the Darwaysh
and looked back, whereat he was incontinently turned to stone
like the scores of knights and adventurers who had foregone him.
Meantime the Princess Perizadah ever carried the hunting-knife,
which Bahman her brother had given her, sheathed as it was in her
maiden zone. She had kept it there ever since he set out upon
his perilous expedition, and whenever she felt disposed she would
bare the blade and judge by its sheen how fared her brother. Now
until that day when he was transmewed to stone she found it, as
often as she looked at it, clean and bright; but on the very evening
when that evil fate betided him perchance Prince Parwez said to
Perizadah, “O sister mine, give me I pray thee the hunting-knife
that I may see how goeth it with our brother.” She took it from
her waist-belt and handed it to him; and as soon as he unsheathed
the knife lo and behold! he saw gouts of gore begin to drop from
it. Noting this he dashed the hunting-knife down and burst out
into loud lamentations, whilst the Princess who divined what had
happened shed a flood of bitter tears and cried with sighs and
sobs, “Alas, O my brother, thou hast given thy life for me. Ah,
woe is me and well-away! why did I tell thee of the Speaking-Bird
and the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water? Wherefore
did I ask that holy woman how she liked our home, and hear of
those three things in answer to my question? Would to Heaven
she had never crossed our threshold and darkened our doors!
Ungrateful hypocrite, dost thou requite me on such wise for the
favour and the honour I was fain to show thee; and what made
me ask of thee the means whereby to win these things? If now I
obtain possession of them what will they advantage me, seeing
that my brother Bahman is no more? What should I ever do with
them?” Thus did Perizadah indulge her grief bewailing her sad
fate; while Parwez in like manner moaned for his brother Bahman
with exceeding bitter mourning. At last the Prince, who despite
his sorrow was assured that his sister still ardently desired to
possess the three marvels, turned to Perizadah and said, “It behoveth
me, O my sister, to set out forthright and to discover
whether Bahman our brother met his death by doom of Destiny,
or whether some enemy have slain him; and if he hath been killed
then must I take full vengeance on his murtherer.” Perizadah
besought him with much weeping and wailing not to leave her,
and said, “O joy of my heart, Allah upon thee, follow not in the
footsteps of our dear departed brother nor quit me in order to
attempt a journey so rife in risks. I care naught for those things
in my fear lest I lose thee also while attempting such enterprise.”
But Prince Parwez would on no wise listen to her lament and next
day took leave of her, but ere he fared she said to him, “The
hunting-knife which Bahman left with me was the means of informing
us concerning the mishap which happened to him; but,
say me how shall I know what happeneth to thee?” Then he
produced a string of pearls which numbered one hundred and said,
“As long as thou shalt see these pearls all parted one from other
and each running loose upon the string, then do thou know that I
am alive; but an thou shouldst find them fixed and adhering
together then be thou ware that I am dead.” The Princess taking
the string of pearls hung it around her neck, determined to observe
it hour after hour and find out how it fared with her second
brother. After this Prince Parwez set out upon his travels and at
the twentieth stage came to the same spot where Bahman had
found the Darwaysh and saw him there in like condition. Then,
after saluting him with the salam, the Prince asked, “Canst thou
tell me where to find the Speaking-Bird and the Singing-Tree and
the Golden-Water; and by what manner of means I may get
possession of them? An thou can I pray thee inform me of this
matter.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her

  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Darwaysh strave to stay Prince Parwez from his design and shewed
him all the dangers on the way. Quoth he, “Not many days ago
one like unto thee in years and in features came hither and
enquired of me concerning the matter thou now seekest. I warned
him of the perils of the place and would have weaned him from
his wilful ways, but he paid no wise heed to my warnings and
refused to accept my counsel. He went off with full instructions
from me how to find those things he sought; but as yet he hath
not returned, and doubtless he also hath perished like the many
who preceded him upon that perilous enterprise.” Then said
Prince Parwez, “O holy father, I know the man of whom thou
speakest, for that he was my brother; and I learned that he was
dead, but have no inkling of the cause whereby he died.” Replied
the Darwaysh, “O my lord, I can inform thee on this matter; he
hath been transmewed into a black stone, like the others of whom
I just now spake to thee. If thou wilt not accept my advice and
act according to my counsel thou also surely shalt perish by the
same means as did thy brother; and I solemnly forewarn thee to
desist from this endeavour.” Prince Parwez having pondered
these words, presently made reply, “O Darwaysh, I thank thee
again and again and am much beholden to thee in that thou art
fain of my welfare and thou hast given me the kindest of counsel
and the friendliest of advice; nor am I worthy of such favours
bestowed upon a stranger. But now remaineth naught for me to
beseech save that thou wilt point out the path, for I am fully
purposed to fare forwards and on no wise to desist from my
endeavour. I pray thee favour me with full instructions for the
road even as thou favourest my brother.” Then said the Darwaysh,
“An thou wilt not lend ear to my warnings and do as I
desire thee, it mattereth to me neither mickle nor little. Choose
for thyself and I by doom of Destiny must perforce forward thy
attempt and albeit, by reason of my great age and infirmities, I
may not conduct thee to the place I will not grudge thee a guide.”
Then Prince Parwez mounted his horse and the Darwaysh taking
one of many balls from out his scrip placed it in the youth’s hands,
directing him the while what to do, as he had counselled his
brother Bahman; and, after giving him much advice and many
warnings he ended with saying, “O my lord, have a heed not to be
perplexed and terrified by the threatening Voices,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6593" id="noteref-6593" epub:type="noteref">6593</a> and sounds from
unseen beings, which shall strike thine ear; but advance dauntless
to the hill-top where thou shalt find the cage with the Speaking-Bird
and the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water.” The Fakir
then bid him adieu with words of good omen and the Prince set
forth. He threw the ball on the ground before him and, as it rolled
up the path, he urged his horse to keep pace with it. But when he
reached the hill-foot and saw that the ball had stopped and lay still,
he dismounted forthright and paused awhile ere he should begin to
climb and conned well in his mind the directions, one and all, given
to him by the Darwaysh. Then, with firm courage and fast resolve,
he set out afoot to reach the hill-top. But hardly had he begun
to climb before he heard a voice beside him threatening him in
churlish tongue and crying, “O youth of ill-omen, stand still that I
may trounce thee for this thine insolence.” Hearing these insulting
words of the Invisible Speaker, Prince Parwez felt his blood boil
over; he could not refrain his rage and in his passion he clean forgot
the words of wisdom wherewith the Fakir had warned him. He
seized his sword and drawing it from the scabbard, turned about to
slay the man who durst insult him on such wise; but he saw no
one and, in the act of looking back both he and his horse became
black stones. Meanwhile the Princess ceased not at all hours of
the day and watches of the night to consult the string of pearls
which Parwez had left her: she counted them overnight when she
retired to rest, she slept with them around her neck during the
hours of darkness, and when she awoke at the dawn of day she
first of all consulted them and noted their condition. Now at the
very hour when her second brother was turned to stone she found
the pearls sticking one to other so close together that she might
not move a single bead apart from its fellows and she knew thereby
that Prince Parwez also was lost to her for ever.——And as
the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princess Perizadah was sore grieved at so sudden a blow and said
to herself, “Ah! woe is me and well-away! How bitter will be
living without the love of such brothers whose youthtide was
sacrificed for me! ’Tis but right that I share their fate whate’er
be my lot; else what shall I have to say on the Day of Doom
and the Resurrection of the Dead and the Judgment of Mankind?”
Wherefore next morning, without further let or stay,
she donned disguise of man’s attire; and, warning her women
and slaves that she would be absent on an errand for a term of
days during which they would be in charge of the house and
goods, she mounted her hackney and set out alone and unattended.
Now, inasmuch as she was skilled in horsemanship
and had been wont to accompany her brothers when hunting and
hawking, she was better fitted than other women to bear the toils
and travails of travel. So on the twentieth day she arrived safe
and sound at the hermitage-hut where, seeing the same Shaykh,
she took seat beside him and after salaming to him and greeting
him she asked him, “O holy father, suffer me to rest and refresh
myself awhile in this site of good omen; then deign point out to
me, I pray thee, the direction of the place, at no far distance
herefrom, wherein are found a certain Speaking-Bird and a Singing-Tree
and a Golden-Water. An thou wilt tell me I shall deem
this the greatest of favour.” Replied the Darwaysh, “Thy voice
revealeth to me that thou art a woman and no man, albeit attired
in male’s apparel. Well I wot the stead whereof thou speakest
and which containeth the marvellous things thou hast named.
But say me, what is thy purpose in asking me?” The Princess
made reply, “I have been told many a tale anent these rare
and wondrous things, and I would fain get possession of them and
bear them to my home and make them its choicest adornments.”
And said the Fakir, “O my daughter, in very truth these matters
are exceeding rare and admirable: right fit are they for fair ones
like thyself to win and take back with thee, but thou hast little
inkling of the dangers manifold and dire that encompass them.
Better far were it for thee to cast away this vain thought and go
back by the road thou camest.” Replied the Princess, “O holy
father and far-famed anchorite, I come from a distant land whereto
I will nevermore return except after winning my wish; no,
never! I pray thee tell me the nature of those dangers and what
they be, that hearing thereof my heart may judge if I have or have
not the strength and the spirit to meet them.” Then the Shaykh
described to the Princess all the risks of the road as erst he had
informed Princes Bahman and Parwez; and he ended with saying,
“The dangers will display themselves as soon as thou shalt begin
to climb the hill-foot and shall not end till such time as thou wilt
have reached the hill-head where is the home of the Speaking-Bird.
Then, if thou be fortunate enough to seize him, he will
direct thee where to find the Singing-Tree and the Golden-Water.
All the time thou climbest the hill, Voices from throats unseen
and accents fierce and fell shall resound in thine ears. Furthermore,
thou shalt see black rocks and boulders strewn upon thy
path; and these, thou must know, are the transformed bodies
of men who with exceeding courage attempted the same enterprise,
but filled with sudden fear and tempted to turn and to look
backwards were changed into stones. Now do thou steadily bear
in mind what was their case. At the first they listened to those
fearful sounds and cursings with firm souls, but anon their hearts
and minds misgave them, or, haply, they fumed with fury to hear
the villain words addressed to them and they turned about and
gazed behind them, whereat both men and horses became black
boulders.” But when the Darwaysh had told her every whit, the
Princess made reply, “From what thou sayest it seemeth clear
to me that these Voices can do nothing but threaten and frighten
by their terrible din; furthermore that there is naught to prevent
a man climbing up the hill, nor is there any fear of any one
attacking him; all he hath to do is on no account to look behind
him.” And after a short pause she presently added, “O Fakir,
albeit a woman yet I have both nerve and thews to carry me
through this adventure. I shall not heed the Voices nor be
enraged thereat, neither will they have any power to dismay me:
moreover, I have devised a device whereby my success on this
point is assured.” “And what wilt thou do?” asked he, and
she answered, “I will stop mine ears with cotton so may not
my mind be disturbed and reason perturbed by hearing those
awesome sounds.” The Fakir marvelled with great marvel and
presently exclaimed, “O my lady, methinks thou art destined
to get possession of the things thou seekest. This plan hath not
occurred to any hitherto<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6594" id="noteref-6594" epub:type="noteref">6594</a> and hence it is haply that one and all
have failed miserably and have perished in the attempt. Take
good heed to thyself however, nor run any risk other than the
enterprise requireth.” She replied, “I have no cause for fear
since this one and only danger is before me to prevent happy
issue. My heart doth bear me witness that I shall surely gain
the guerdon wherefor I have undertaken such toil and trouble.
But now do thou tell me what I must do, and whither to win my
wish I must wend.” The Darwaysh once more besought her to
return home, but Perizadah refused to listen and remained as firm
and resolute as before; so when he saw that she was fully bent
upon carrying out her purpose he exclaimed, “Depart, O my
daughter, in the peace of Almighty Allah and His blessing; and
may He defend thy youth and beauty from all danger.” Then
taking from his bag a ball he gave it her and said, “When thou
art seated in saddle throw this before thee and follow it whitherso
it lead thee; and when it shall stop at the hill-foot then dismount
and climb the slope. What will happen after I have already told
thee.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princess after farewelling the Fakir straightway bestrode her steed
and threw the ball in front of his hooves as she had been bidden
do. It rolled along before her in the direction of the hill and she
urged her hackney to keep up with it, until reaching the hill it
suddenly stopped. Hereat the Princess dismounted forthwith and
having carefully plugged both her ears with cotton, began to breast
the slope with fearless heart and dauntless soul; and as soon as
she had advanced a few steps a hubbub of voices broke out all
around her, but she heard not a sound, by reason of her hearing
being blunted by the cotton-wool. Then hideous cries arose with
horrid din, still she heard them not; and at last they grew to a
storm of shouts and shrieks and groans and moans flavoured with
foul language such as shameless women use when railing one at
other. She caught now and then an echo of the sounds but recked
naught thereof and only laughed and said to herself, “What care I
for their scoffs and jeers and fulsome taunts? Let them hoot on
and bark and bay as they may: this at least shall not turn me
from my purpose.” As she approached the goal the path became
perilous in the extreme and the air was so filled with an infernal
din and such awful sounds that even Rustam would have quailed
thereat and the bold spirit of Asfandiyar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6595" id="noteref-6595" epub:type="noteref">6595</a> have quaked with terror.
The Princess, however, pressed on with uttermost speed and dauntless
heart till she neared the hill-top and espied above her the cage
in which the Speaking-Bird was singing with melodious tones;
but, seeing the Princess draw nigh, he broke out despite his puny
form in thundering tones and cried, “Return, O fool: hie thee
back nor dare come nearer.” Princess Perizadah heeded not his
clamour a whit but bravely reached the hill-top, and running over
the level piece of ground made for the cage and seized it saying,
“At last I have thee and thou shalt not escape me.” She then
pulled out the cotton-wool wherewith she had stopped her ears,
and heard the Speaking-Bird reply in gentle accents, “O lady
valiant and noble, be of good cheer for no harm or evil shall
betide thee, as hath happened to those who essayed to make me
their prize. Albeit I am encaged I have much secret knowledge
of what happeneth in the world of men and I am content to
become thy slave, and for thee to be my liege lady. Moreover I
am more familiar with all that concerneth thee even than thou art
thyself; and one day of the days I will do thee a service which shall
deserve thy gratitude. What now is thy command? Speak that
I may fulfil thy wish.” Princess Perizadah was gladdened by
these words, but in the midst of her joy she grieved at the thought
of how she had lost her brothers whom she loved with a love so
dear, and anon she said to the Speaking-Bird, “Full many a thing
I want, but first tell me if the Golden-Water, of which I have
heard so much, be nigh unto this place and if so do thou show me
where to find it.” The Bird directed her accordingly and the
Princess took a silver flagon she had brought with her and filled it
brimful from the magical fount. Then quoth she to the Bird,
“The third and last prize I have come to seek is the Singing-Tree:
discover to me where that also can be found.” The Bird
replied, “O Princess of fair ones, behind thy back in yonder clump
that lieth close at hand groweth the Tree;” so she went forthright
to the copse and found the Tree she sought singing with sweetest
toned voice. But inasmuch as it was huge in girth she returned
to her slave the Bird and said, “The Tree indeed I found but ’tis
lofty and bulky; how then shall I pull it up?” and he made
answer, “Pluck but a branchlet of the Tree and plant it in thy
garden: ’twill at once take root and in shortest time be as gross
and fair a growth as that in yonder copse.” So the Princess broke
off a twig, and now that she had secured the three things, whereof
the holy woman spake to her, she was exceeding joyful and turning
to the Bird said, “I have in very deed won my wish, but one thing
is yet wanting to my full satisfaction. My brothers who ventured
forth with this same purpose are lying hereabouts turned into black
stones; and I fain would have them brought to life again and the
twain return with me in all satisfaction and assurance of success.
Tell me now some plan whereby mine every desire may be fulfilled.”——And
as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Speaking-Bird replied, “O Princess, trouble not thyself, the thing
is easy. Sprinkle some of the Golden-Water from the flagon upon
the black stones lying round about, and by virtue thereof each and
every shall come to life again, thy two brothers as well as the others.”
So Princess Perizadah’s heart was set at rest and taking the three
prizes with her she fared forth and scattered a few drops from the
silver flagon upon each black stone as she passed it when, lo and
behold! they came to life as men and horses. Amongst them were
her brothers whom she at once knew and falling on their necks she
embraced them, and asked in tones of surprise, “O my brothers,
what do ye here?” To this they answered, “We lay fast asleep.”
Quoth she, “Strange indeed that ye take delight in slumber away
from me and ye forget the purpose wherefor ye left me; to wit, the
winning of the Speaking-Bird and the Singing-Tree and the
Golden-Water. Did ye not see this place all bestrown with dark
hued rocks? Look now and say if there be aught left of them.
These men and horses now standing around us were all black
stones as ye yourselves also were; but, by the boon of Almighty
Allah, all have come to life again and await the signal to depart.
And if now ye wish to learn by what strange miracle both ye and
they have recovered human shape, know ye that it hath been
wrought by virtue of a water contained in this flagon which I
sprinkled on the rocks with leave of the Lord of all Living.
When I had gained possession of this cage and its Speaking-Bird,
and also of the Singing-Tree, a wand whereof ye see in my hand,
and lastly of the Golden-Water, I would not take them home with
me unless ye twain could also bear me company; so I asked of
this Bird the means whereby ye could be brought to life again.
He made me drop some drops of the Golden-Water on the
boulders and when I had done this ye two like all the others
returned to life and to your proper forms.” Hearing these her
words the Princes Bahman and Parwez thanked and praised their
sister Perizadah; and all the others she had saved showered thanks
and blessings on her head saying with one accord, “O our lady, we
are now thy slaves; nor can a life-long service repay the debt of
gratitude we owe thee for this favour thou hast shown us. Command
and we are ready to obey thee with our hearts and our
souls.” Quoth Perizadah, “The bringing back to life of these my
brothers were my aim and purpose, and in so doing ye too have
profited thereby; and I accept your acknowledgments as another
pleasure. But now do ye mount each and every man his horse
and ride back by the way ye came to your homes in Allah’s
peace.” On this wise the Princess dismissed them and made herself
also ready to depart; but, as she was about to bestride her
steed, Prince Bahman asked permission of her that he might
hold in hand the cage and ride in front of her. She answered,
“Not so, O brother mine; this Bird is now my slave and I will
carry him myself. An thou wilt, take thou this twig with thee,
but hold the cage only till I am seated in saddle.” She then
mounted her hackney and, placing the cage before her on the
pommel, bade her brother Parwez take charge of the Golden-Water
in the silver flagon and carry it with all care and the Prince
did her bidding without gainsaying. And when they all were
ready to ride forth, including the knights and the squires whom
Perizadah had brought to life by sprinkling the Water the Princess
turned to them and said, “Why delay we our departure and how
is it that none offereth to lead us?” But as all hesitated she gave
command, “Now let him amongst your number whose noblesse
and high degree entitle him to such distinction fare before us and
show us the way.” Then all with one accord replied, “O Princess
of fair ones, there be none amongst us worthy of such honour, nor
may any wight dare to ride before thee.” So when she saw that
none amongst them claimed pre-eminence or right of guidance,
and none desired to take precedence of the rest, she made excuse
and said, “O my lords, ’tis not for me by right to lead the way,
but since ye order I must needs obey.” Accordingly she pushed
on to the front, and after came her brothers and behind them the
rest. And as they journeyed on all desired to see the holy man,
and thank him for his favours and friendly rede, but when they
reached the spot where he dwelt they found him dead, and they
knew not if old age had taken him away, or if he perished in his
pride because the Princess Perizadah had found and had carried off
the three things whereof he had been appointed by Destiny guard
and guide.——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad held

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that all the
company rode on, and as each one arrived at the road which led him
to his natal land he took leave of the Lady Perizadah and went his
way, until all were gone and the Princess and her brothers were
the only left. At last they reached their journey’s end safe and
sound, and on entering their mansion Perizadah hung the cage
inside the garden hard by the belvedere and no sooner did the
Speaking-Bird begin to sing than flights of ringdoves and bulbuls
and nightingales and skylarks and parrots and other songsters came
flocking around him from afar and anear. Likewise she set the twig,
which she had taken from the Singing-Tree, in a choice parterre
also hard by the belvedere, and forthright it took root and put forth
boughs and buds and grew goodly in growth, till it became a trunk
as large as that from which she had plucked the twig, whilst from
its leafage went forth bewitching sounds rivalling the music of
the parent tree. She lastly bid them carve her a basin of pure
white marble and set it in the centre of the pleasure grounds;
then she poured therein the Golden-Water and forthright it filled
the bowl and shot upwards like a spouting fountain some twenty
feet in height; moreover the gerbes and jets fell back whence they
came and not one drop was lost: whereby the working of the
waters was unbroken and ever similar. Now but few days passed
ere the report of these three wonders was bruited abroad and
flocked the folk daily from the city to solace themselves with the
sight, and the gates stood always open wide and all who came had
entrance to the house and gardens and free leave to walk about at
will and see these rarities which affected them with admiration and
delight. Then also, as soon as both the Princes had recovered
from the toils of travel, they began to go a-hunting as heretofore;
and it chanced one day they rode forth several miles from home
and were both busied in the chase, when the Shah of Irán-land
came by decree of Destiny to the same place for the same purpose.
The Princes, seeing a band of knights and huntsmen drawing near,
were fain to ride home and to avoid such meeting; so they left the
hunting-grounds and turned them homewards. But as Fate and
lot would have it they hit upon the very road whereby King
Khusrau Shah was coming, and so narrow was the path that they
could not avoid the horsemen by wheeling round and wending
another way. So they drew rein perforce and dismounting they
salamed and did obeisance to the Shah and stood between his
hands with heads bent low. The Sovran, seeing the horses’ fine
trappings and the Princes’ costly garments, thought that the two
youths were in the suite of his Wazirs and his Ministers of state
and much wished to look upon their faces; he therefore bade them
raise their heads and stand upright in the presence and they obeyed
his bidding with modest mien and downcast eyes. He was
charmed to behold their comeliness of favour and their graceful
forms and their noble air and their courtly mien; and, after gazing
at them for some time in not a little wonder and admiration, he
asked them who they were and what might be their names and
where they abode. Hereto Prince Bahman made reply, “O Asylum
of the Universe, we are the sons of one whose life was spent
in serving the Shah, the Intendant of the royal gardens and
pleasaunces. As his days drew to a close he builded him a home
without the town for us to dwell in till we should grow to man’s
estate and become fit to do thy Highness suit and service and
carry out thy royal commands.” The Shah furthermore asked
them, “How is it that ye go a-hunting? This is a special sport
of Kings and is not meant for the general of his subjects and
dependants.” Prince Bahman rejoined, “O Refuge of the World,
we yet are young in years and being brought up at home we
know little of courtly customs; but, as we look to bear arms in
the armies of the Shah we fain would train our bodies to toil and
moil.” This answer was honoured by the royal approof and the
King rejoined, “The Shah would see how ye deal with noble
game; so choose ye whatever quarry ye will and bring it down in
the presence.” The Princes hereat remounted their horses and joined
the Sovran; and when they reached the thick-most of the forest,
Prince Bahman started a tiger and Prince Parwez rode after a
bear; and the twain used their spears with such skill and good
will that each killed his quarry and laid it at the Shah’s feet.
Then entering the wood again Prince Bahman slew a bear, and
Prince Parwez a tiger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6596" id="noteref-6596" epub:type="noteref">6596</a> and did as before; but when they would
have ridden off the third time the King forbade them saying,
“What! would ye strip the royal preserve of all the game? This
be enough and more than enough, the Shah wished only to put
your valour to the proof and having seen it with his own eyes he
is fully satisfied. Come now with us and stand before us as we sit
at meat.” Prince Bahman made reply, “We are not worthy of the
high honour and dignity wherewith thou favourest us thy humble
servants. We dutifully and humbly petition thy Highness to hold
us excused for this day; but if the Asylum of the Universe deign
appoint some other time thy slaves will right gladly execute thy
auspicious orders.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that Khusrau
Shah, astonished at their refusal, asked the cause thereof when
Prince Bahman answered, “May I be thy sacrifice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6597" id="noteref-6597" epub:type="noteref">6597</a> O King of
kings, we have at home an only sister; and all three are bound
together with bonds of the fondest affection; so we brothers go
not anywhere without consulting her nor doth she aught save
according to our counsel.” The King was pleased to see such
fraternal love and union and presently quoth he, “By the head of
the Shah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6598" id="noteref-6598" epub:type="noteref">6598</a> he freely giveth you leave to go to-day: consult your
sister and meet the Shadow of Allah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6599" id="noteref-6599" epub:type="noteref">6599</a> to-morrow at this hunting-ground,
and tell him what she saith and if she be content to let
you twain come and wait upon the Shah at meat.” So the Princes
farewelled and prayed for him; then rode back home; but they
both forgot to tell their sister how they had fallen in with the King;
and of all that passed between them they remembered not one
word.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6600" id="noteref-6600" epub:type="noteref">6600</a> Next day again they went a-hunting and on returning from
the chase the Shah enquired of them, “Have ye consulted with
your sister if ye may serve the King, and what saith she thereto?
Have ye obtained permission from her?” On hearing these words
the Princes waxed aghast with fear; the colour of their faces
changed, and each began to look into the other’s eyes. Then
Bahman said, “Pardon, O Refuge of the World, this our transgression.
We both forgot the command and remembered not to
tell our sister.” Replied the King, “It mattereth naught! ask her
to-day and bring me word to-morrow.” But it so happened that on
that day also they forgot the message yet the King was not annoyed
at their shortness of memory, but taking from his pocket three little
balls of gold, and tying them in a kerchief of silk, he handed them
to Prince Bahman saying, “Put these balls in thy waist-shawl, so
shalt thou not forget to ask thy sister; and if perchance the matter
escape thy memory, when thou shalt go to bed and take off thy
girdle, haply the sound of them falling to the ground will remind
thee of thy promise.” Despite this strict injunction of the Shadow
of Allah the Princes on that day also clean forgot the order and
the promise they had made to the King. When, however, night
came on, and Prince Bahman went to his bed-chamber for sleep,
he loosed his girdle and down fell the golden balls and at the sound
the message of the Shah flashed across his thought. So he and his
brother Parwez at once hastened to Perizadah’s bower, where she
was about retiring to rest; and, with many excuses for troubling
her at so unseasonable an hour, reported to her all that had
happened. She lamented their thoughtlessness which for three
successive days had caused them forget the royal behest and
ended with saying, “Fortune hath favoured you, O my brothers,
and brought you suddenly to the notice of the Asylum of the
Universe, a chance which often hath led to the height of good. It
grieveth me sore that in your over regard for our fraternal love and
union ye did not take service with the King when he deigned
command you. Moreover ye have far greater cause for regret and
repentance than I in that ye failed to plead a sufficient excuse and
that which ye offered must have sounded rude and churlish. A
right dangerous thing it is to thwart Kingly wishes. In his extreme
condescension the Shah commandeth you to take service with him
and ye, in rebelling against his exalted orders have done foolishly
and ye have caused me much trouble of mind. Howbeit I will sue
counsel from my slave the Speaking-Bird and see what he may say;
for when I have ever any hard and weighty question to decide I
fail not to ask his advice.” Hereupon the Princess set the cage by
her side and after telling her slave all that her brothers had made
known to her, asked admonition of him regarding what they should
do. The Speaking-Bird made answer, “It behoveth the Princes
to gratify the Shah in all things he requireth of them; moreover,
let them make ready a feast for the King and humbly pray him to
visit this house, and thereby testify to him loyalty and devotion to
his royal person.” Then said the Princess, “O Bird, my brothers
are most dear to me nor would I suffer them leave my sight for
one moment if it were possible; and Allah forfend that this daring
on their part do injury to our love and affection.” Said the
Speaking-Bird, “I have counselled thee for the best and have
offered thee the right rede; nor do thou fear aught in following it,
for naught save good shall come therefrom.” “But,” quoth the
Princess, “an the Shadow of Allah honour us by crossing the
threshold of this house needs must I present myself before him
with face unveiled?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6601" id="noteref-6601" epub:type="noteref">6601</a> “By all means,” quoth the Speaking-Bird,
“this will not harm thee, nay rather ’twill be to thine advantage.”——And

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that
early next day the two Princes Bahman and Parwez rode as
aforetime to the hunting-ground and met Khusrau Shah, who
asked them, saying, “What answer bring ye from your sister?”
Hereupon the elder brother advancing said, “O Shadow of Allah,
verily we are thy slaves and whatever thou deign bid that we are
ready to obey. These less than the least have referred the matter
to their sister and have obtained her consent; nay more, she
blamed and chided them for that they did not hurry to carry out
the commands of the Refuge of the World the moment they
were delivered. Therefore being sore displeased at us, she
desireth us on her behalf to plead forgiveness with the Sháhinshah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6602" id="noteref-6602" epub:type="noteref">6602</a>
for this offence by us offered.” Replied the King, “No crime
have ye committed to call forth the royal displeasure: nay more,
it delighteth the Shadow of Allah exceedingly to see the love
ye twain bear towards your sister.” Hearing such words of condescension
and kindliness from the Shah, the Princes held their
peace and hung their heads for shame groundwards; and the
King who that day was not keen, according to his custom, after
the chase, whenever he saw the brothers hold aloof, called
them to his presence and heartened their hearts with words of
favour; and presently, when aweary of sport, he turned the head
of his steed palace-wards and deigned order the Princes to ride
by his side. The Wazirs and Councillors and Courtiers one and
all fumed with envy and jealousy to see two unknowns entreated
with such especial favour; and as they rode at the head of the
suite adown the market-street all eyes were turned upon the
youths and men asked one of other, “Who be the two who ride
beside the Shah? Belong they to this city, or come they from
some foreign land?” And the folk praised and blessed them
saying, “Allah send our King of kings two Princes as goodly
and gallant as are these twain who ride beside him. If our hapless
Queen who languisheth in durance had brought forth sons, by
Allah’s favour they would now be of the same age as these young
lords.” But as soon as the cavalcade reached the palace the King
alighted from his horse and led the Princes to his private chamber,
a splendid retreat magnificently furnished, wherein a table had
been spread with sumptuous meats and rarest cates; and having
seated himself thereat he motioned them to do likewise. Hereupon
the brothers making low obeisance also took their seats
and ate in well-bred silence with respectful mien. Then the Shah,
desiring to warm them into talk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6603" id="noteref-6603" epub:type="noteref">6603</a> and thereby to test their wit
and wisdom, addressed them on themes galore and asked of them
many questions; and, inasmuch as they had been taught well
and trained in every art and science, they answered with propriety
and perfect ease. The Shah struck with admiration
bitterly regretted that Almighty Allah had not vouchsafed to him
sons so handsome in semblance and so apt and so learned
as these twain; and, for the pleasure of listening to them, he
lingered at meat longer than he was wont to do. And when he
rose from table and retired with them to his private apartment
he still sat longwhile talking with them and at last in his
admiration he exclaimed, “Never until this day have I set eyes
on youths so well brought up and so comely and so capable as
are these, and methinks ’twere hard to find their equals anywhere.”
In fine quoth he, “The time waxeth late, so now let
us cheer our hearts with music.” And forthright the royal band
of minstrels and musicians began to sing and perform upon
instruments of mirth and merriment, whilst dancing-girls and
boys displayed their skill, and mimes and mummers played their
parts. The Princes enjoyed the spectacle with extreme joy and
the last hours of the afternoon passed in royal revelry and regale.
But when the sun had set and evening came on, the youths
craved dismissal from the Shah with many expressions of gratitude
for the exalted favours he had deigned bestow on them; and ere
they fared forth the King of kings bespake them, saying, “Come
ye again on the morrow to our hunting-ground as heretofore, and
thence return to the palace. By the beard of the Shah, he fain
would have you always with him, and solace him with your companionship
and converse.” Prince Bahman, prostrating himself
before the presence, answered, “’Tis the very end and aim of all
our wishes, O Shadow of Allah upon Earth, that on the morrow
when thou shalt come from the chase and pass by our poor house,
thou graciously deign enter and rest in it awhile, thereby conferring
the highmost of honours upon ourselves and upon our
sister. Albeit the place is not worthy of the Shahinshah’s exalted
presence, yet at times do mighty Kings condescend to visit the
huts of their slaves.” The King, ever more and more enchanted
with their comeliness and pleasant speech, vouchsafed a most
gracious answer, saying, “The dwelling-place of youths in your
estate and degree will certainly be goodly and right worthy of
you; and the Shah willingly consenteth for the morrow to become
the guest of you twain and of your sister whom, albeit he have
not yet seen, he is assured to find perfect in all gifts of body
and mind. Do ye twain therefore about early dawn-tide expect
the Shah at the usual trysting place.” The Princes then craved
leave to wend their ways; and going home said to their sister,
“O Perizadah, the Shah hath decreed that to-morrow he will
come to our house and rest here awhile after the hunt.” Said
she, “An so it be, needs must we see to it that all be made
ready for a royal banquet and we may not be put to shame when
the Shadow of Allah shall deign shade us. There is no help but
that in this matter I ask of my slave, the Speaking-Bird, what
counsel he would give; and that prepare according thereto such
meats as are meet for him and are pleasing to the royal palate.”——And

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princes both approved of her plan and went to seek repose;
whereupon Perizadah sent for the cage and setting it before her
said, “O Bird, the Shah hath made a promise and hath decreed
that he will deign honour this our house on the morrow, wherefore
we must needs make ready for our liege lord the best of banquets
and I bid thee say me what dishes should the kitcheners cook
for him?” The Speaking-Bird replied, “O my lady, thou hast the
most skilful of cooks and confectioners. Do thou bid them dress
for thee the choicest dainties, but above all others see thou with
thine own eyes that they set before the Shah a dish of new green
cucumbers stuffed with pearls.” Quoth the Princess in utter
wonderment, “Never until this time heard I of such a dainty!
How? cucumbers with a filling of pearls! And what will the
King, who cometh to eat bread and not to gaze on stones, say to
such meat? Furthermore, I have not in my possession pearls
enough to serve for even a single cucumber.” Replied the Speaking-Bird,
“This were an easy matter: do thou dread naught but only
act as I shall advise thee. I seek not aught save thy welfare and
would on no wise counsel thee to thy disadvantage. As for the
pearls thou shalt collect them on this wise; go thou to-morrow
betimes to the pleasure-gardens and bid a hole be dug at the foot of
the first tree in the avenue to thy right hand, and there shalt thou
find of pearls as large a store as thou shalt require.” So after
dawn on the next day Princess Perizadah bade a gardener-lad
accompany her and fared to the site within the pleasure-gardens
whereof the Speaking-Bird had told her. Here the boy dug a hole
both deep and wide when suddenly his spade struck upon somewhat
hard, and he removed with his hands the earth and discovered
to view a golden casket well-nigh one foot square. Hereupon the
young gardener showed it to the Princess who exclaimed, “I
brought thee with me for this very reason. Take heed and see
that no harm come to it, but dig it out and bring it to me with all
care.” When the lad did her bidding she opened it forthright and
found it filled with pearls and unions fresh from the sea, round as
rings and all of one and the same size perfectly fitted for the purpose
which the Speaking-Bird had proposed. Perizadah rejoiced with
extreme joy at the sight and taking up the box walked back with
it to the house; and the Princes who had seen their sister faring
forth betimes with the gardener-lad and had wondered why she went
to the park thus early unaccording to her wonted custom, catching
sight of her from the casement quickly donned their walking
dresses and came to meet her. And as the two brothers walked
forwards they saw the Princess approaching them with somewhat
unusual under her arm, which when they met, proved to be a
golden casket whereof they knew naught. Quoth they, “O our
sister, at early light we espied thee going to the pleasure grounds
with a gardener-lad empty handed, but now thou bringest back this
golden casket; so disclose to us where and how thou hast found it;
and haply there may be some hoard close hidden in the parterre?”
Perizadah replied, “Sooth ye say, O my brothers: I took this lad
with me and made him dig under a certain tree where we came
upon this box of pearls, at the sight whereof methinks your hearts
will be delighted.” The Princess straightway opened the box and her
Brothers sighting the pearls and unions were amazed with extreme
amazement and rejoiced greatly to see them. Quoth the Princess,
“Come now ye twain with me, for that I have in hand a weighty
matter;” and quoth Prince Bahman, “What is there to do? I
pray thee tell us without delay for never yet hast thou kept aught
of thy life from us.” She made reply, “O my brothers, I have
nothing to hide from you, nor think ye any ill of me, for I am now
about to tell you all the tale.” Then she made known to them
what advice the Speaking-Bird had given to her; and they, conning
the matter over in their minds, marvelled much why her slave
had bidden them set a dish of green cucumbers stuffed with pearls
before the Shah, nor could they devise any reason for it. Presently
the Princess resumed, “The Speaking-Bird indeed is wise and
ware; so methinks this counsel must be for our advantage; and
at any rate it cannot be without some object and purpose. It
therefore behoveth us to do even as he hath commanded.” Hereupon
the Princess went to her own chamber and summoning the
head cook said to him, “This day the Shah, the Shadow of Allah
upon Earth, will condescend here to eat the noon-meal. So do thou
take heed that the meats be of choicest flavour and fittest to set
before the Asylum of the World, but of all the dishes there is one
thou alone must make and let not another have a hand therein.
This shall be of the freshest green cucumbers with a stuffing of
unions and pearls.”——And as the morn began to dawn Shahrazad
held her peace till</p>

    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
head Cook listened to this order of the Princess with wonderment
and said in himself, “Who ever heard of such a dish or dreamed
of ordering such an one.” The Lady seeing his astonishment
betrayed in his semblance without the science of thought-reading,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6604" id="noteref-6604" epub:type="noteref">6604</a>
said to him, “It seemeth from thy countenance that thou deemest
me daft of wits to give thee such order. I know that no one
ever tasted a dish of the kind, but what is that to thee? Do
thou e’en as thou art bidden. Thou seest this box brimful of
pearls; so take of them as many as thou needest for the dish, and
what remaineth over leave in the box.” The Kitchener who
could answer nothing in his confusion and amazement, chose as
many precious stones as he required, and presently fared away to
superintend the meats being cooked and made ready for the feast.
Meanwhile the Princess went over the house and grounds and
gave directions to the slaves about the ordinance thereof, lending
especial attention to the carpets and divans, the lamps and all
other furniture. Next day at break of dawn Princes Bahman and
Parwez rode forth in rich attire to the appointed place where they
first met the Shah, who was also punctual to his promise and
vouchsafed to join them in the hunt. Now when the sun had
risen high and its rays waxed hot, the King gave up the chase,
and set forth with the Princes to their house; and as they drew
nigh thereto the cadet pushed forwards and sent word to the
Princess that the Asylum of the World was coming in all good
omen. Accordingly, she hastened to receive him and stood
waiting his arrival at the inner entrance; and after, when the King
rode up to the gate and dismounting within the court stepped
over the threshold of the house-door, she fell down at his feet
and did him worship. Hereat her brothers said, “O Asylum of
the World, this is our sister of whom we spake;” and the Shah
with gracious kindness and condescension raised her by the
hand, and when he saw her face he marvelled much at its
wondrous comeliness and loveliness. He thought in himself,
“How like she is to her brothers in favour and form, and I trow
there be none of all my lieges in city or country who can compare
with them for beauty and noble bearing. This country-house
also exceedeth all that I have ever seen in splendour and grandeur.”
The Princess then led the Shah through the house
and showed him all the magnificence thereof, while he rejoiced
with extreme joy at everything that met his sight. So when
King Khusrau had considered whatso was in the mansion he
said to the Princess, “This home of thine is far grander than any
palace owned by the Shah, who would now stroll about the pleasure-garden,
never doubting but that it will be delightsome as the
house.” Hereat the Princess threw wide open the door whence
the grounds could be seen; and at once the King beheld before
and above all other things, the fountain which cast up incessantly,
in gerbes and jets, water clear as crystal withal golden of hue.
Seeing such prodigy he cried, “This is indeed a glorious gusher:
never before saw I one so admirable. But say me where is its
source, and by what means doth it shoot up in spurts so high?
Whence cometh this constant supply and in what fashion was it
formed? The Shah would fain see it near hand.” “O King of
kings, and Lord of the lands,” quoth the Princess, “be pleased to do
whatso thou desirest.” Thereupon they went up to the fountain
and the Shah stood gazing upon it with delight when behold, he
heard a concert of sugar-sweet voices choiring with the harmony
and melody of wit-ravishing music. So he turned him round and
gazed about him to discover the singers, but no one was in sight;
and albeit he looked both far and near all was in vain, he heard
the voices but he could descry no songster. At length completely
baffled he exclaimed, “Whence come these most musical of
sounds; and rise they from the bowels of earth or are they
floating in the depths of air? They fill the heart with rapture,
but strangely surprise the senses to see that no one singer is in
sight.” Replied the Princess with a smile, “O Lord of lords,
there are no minstrels here and the strains which strike the
Shah’s ear come from yonder tree. Deign walk on, I pray thee,
and examine it well.” So he advanced thereto, ever more and
more enchanted with the music, and he gazed now at the Golden-Water
and now at the Singing-Tree till lost in wonderment and
amazement; then, “O Allah,” said he to himself, “is all this Nature-made
or magical, for in very deed the place is full of mystery?”
Presently, turning to the Princess quoth he, “O my lady, prithee
whence came ye by this wondrous tree which hath been planted
in the middlemost of this garden: did anyone bring it from some
far distant land as a rare gift, and by what name is it known?”
Quoth Perizadah in reply, “O King of kings, this marvel hight
Singing-Tree groweth not in our country. ’Twere long to recount
whence and by what means I obtained it; and suffice it for the present
to say that the Tree, together with the Golden-Water and the
Speaking-Bird, were all found by me at one and the same time.
Deign now accompany thy slave and look upon this third
rarity; and when the Shah shall have rested and recovered from
the toils and travails of hunting, the tale of these three strange
things shall be told to the Asylum of the World in fullest
detail.” Hereto the King replied, “All the Shah’s fatigue hath
gone for gazing upon these wonders; and now to visit the
Speaking-Bird.”——And as the morning began to dawn Shahrazad
held her peace till</p>

    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night.</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Princess took the King and when she had shown to him the
Speaking-Bird, they returned to the garden where he never ceased
considering the fountain with extreme surprise and presently
exclaimed, “How is this? No spring whence cometh all this
water meeteth the Shah’s eye, and no channel; nor is there any
reservoir large enough to contain it.” She replied, “Thou speakest
sooth, O King of kings! This jetting fount hath no source; and
it springeth from a small marble basin which I filled from a single
flagon of the Golden-Water; and by the might of Allah Almighty
it increased and waxed copious until it shot up in this huge gerbe
which the Shah seeth. Furthermore it ever playeth day and night;
and, marvellous to relate, the water falling back from that height
into the basin minisheth not in quantity nor is aught of it spilt or
wasted.” Hereat the King, filled with wonder and astonishment,
bade go back to the Speaking-Bird; whereupon the Princess led
him to the belvedere whence he looked out upon thousands of all
manner fowls carolling in the trees and filling air with their hymns
and praises of the Creator; so he asked his guide, “O my lady,
whence come these countless songsters which haunt yonder tree
and make the welkin resound with their melodious notes; yet they
affect none other of the trees?” Quoth Perizadah, “O King of
kings, they are all attracted by the Speaking-Bird and flock hither
to accompany his song; and for that his cage hangeth to the
window of this belvedere they prefer only the nearest of the trees;
and here he may be heard singing sweeter notes than any of the
others, nay in a plaint more musical far than that of any nightingale.”
And as the Shah drew nigh the cage and gave ear to the
Bird’s singing, the Princess called to her captive saying, “Ho, my
slave the Bird, dost thou not perceive the Asylum of the Universe is
here that thou payest him not due homage and worship?” Hearing
these words the Speaking-Bird forthright ceased his shrilling
and at the same moment all the other songsters sat in deepest
silence; for they were loyal to their liege lord nor durst any one
utter a note when he held his peace. The Speaking-Bird then
spake in human voice saying, “O great King, may Almighty Allah
by His Might and Majesty accord thee health and happiness;” so
the Shah returned the salutation and the Slave of Princess
Perizadah ceased not to shower blessings upon his head. Meanwhile
the tables were spread after sumptuous fashion and the
choicest meats were set before the company which was seated in
due order and degree, the Shah placing himself hard by the
Speaking-Bird and close to the casement where the cage was hung.
Then the dish of green cucumbers having been set before him, he
put forth his hand to help himself, but drew it back in wonderment
when he saw that the cucumbers, ranged in order upon the plate,
were stuffed with pearls which appeared at either end. He asked
the Princess and her brothers, “What is this dish? It cannot be
meant for food; then wherefore is it placed before the Shah?
Explain to me, I command you, what this thing meaneth.” They
could not give an answer unknowing what reply to make, and as
all held their peace the Speaking-Bird answered for them saying,
“O King of the Age and the Time, dost thou deem it strange to
see a dish of cucumbers stuffed with pearls? How much stranger
then it is that thou wast not astonished to hear that the Queen thy
Consort had, contrary to the laws of Allah’s ordinance, given birth
to such animals as dog and cat and musk-rat. This should have
caused thee far more of wonder, for who hath ever heard of woman
bearing such as these?” Hereat the Shah made answer to the
Speaking-Bird, “All that thou sayest is right indeed and I know
that such things are not after the law of Almighty Allah; but I
believed the reports of the midwives, the wise women who were
with the Queen such time she was brought to bed, for they were
not strangers but her own sisters, born of the same parents as herself.
How then could I do otherwise than trust their words?”
Quoth the Speaking-Bird, “O King of kings, indeed the truth of
the matter is not hidden from me. Albeit they be the sisters of
thy Queen, yet seeing the royal favours and affection towards
their cadette they were consumed with anger and hatred and
despite by reason of their envy and jealousy. So they devised
evil devices against her and their deceits at last succeeded in
diverting thy thoughts from her, and in hiding her virtues from thy
sight. Now are their malice and treason made manifest to thee;
and, if thou require further proof, do thou summon them and
question them of the case. They cannot hide it from thee and will
be reduced to confess and crave thy pardon.”——And as the morn
began to dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
Speaking-Bird said also to Khusrau Shah, “These two royal
brothers so comely and stalwart and this lovely Princess, their
sister, are thine own lawful children to whom the Queen thy
Consort gave birth. The midwives, thy sisters-in-law, by reason
of the blackness of their hearts and faces bore them away as soon as
they were born: indeed every time a child was given to thee they
wrapped it in a bit of blanket and putting it in a basket committed
it to the stream which floweth by the palace to the intent that it
might die an obscure death. But it so fortuned that the Intendant
of thy royal gardens espied these baskets one and all as they floated
past his grounds, and took charge of the infants he found therein.
He then caused them to be nursed and reared with all care and,
whilst they were growing up to man’s estate, he looked to their
being taught every art and science; and whilst his life endured
he dealt with them and brought them up in love and tenderness
as though they had been his very own. And now, O Khusrau
Shah, wake from thy sleep of ignorance and heedlessness, and
know that these two Princes Bahman and Parwez and the Princess
Perizadah their sister are thine own issue and thy rightful heirs.”
When the King heard these words and was assured of their purport
being true and understood the evil doing of those Satans, his
sisters-in-law, he said, “O Bird, I am indeed persuaded of thy
soothfastness, for when I first saw these youths at the hunting-ground
my bowels yearned with affection towards them and my
heart felt constrained to love them as though they had been my
own seed. Both they and their sister have drawn my affections
to them as a magnet draweth iron: and the voice of blood crieth
to me and compelleth me to confess the tie and to acknowledge that
they are my true children, borne in the womb of my Queen, whose
direful Destiny I have been the means of carrying out.” Then
turning to the Princes and their sister he said with tearful eyes and
broken voice, “Ye are my children and henceforth do ye regard
me as your father.” At this they ran to him with rare delight and
falling on his neck embraced him. Then they all sat down to
meat and when they had finished eating, Khusrau Shah said to
them, “O my children, I must now leave you, but Inshallah—Allah
willing—I will come again to-morrow and bring with me
the Queen your mother.” So saying he farewelled them fondly
and mounting his horse departed to his palace; and no sooner had
he seated himself upon his throne than he summoned the Grand
Wazir and commanded him saying, “Do thou send this instant
and bind in heaviest bonds those vile women, the sisters of my
Queen; for their ill deeds have at last come to light and they
deserve to die the death of murtherers. Let the Sworder forthright
make sharp his sword; for the ground thirsteth for their
blood. Go see thyself that they are beheaded without stay or
delay: await not other order, but instantly obey my commandment.”
The Grand Wazir went forth at once and in his presence
the Envious Sisters were decapitated and thus underwent fit
punishment for their malice and their evil doing. After this,
Khusrau Shah with his retinue walked afoot to the Cathedral-mosque
whereby the Queen had been imprisoned for so many
years in bitter grief and woe, and with his own hands he led her
forth from her cage and tenderly embraced her. Then seeing her
sad plight and her care-worn countenance and wretched attire he
wept and cried, “Allah Almighty forgive me this mine unjust and
wrongful dealing towards thee. I have put to death thy sisters
who deceitfully and despitefully raised my wrath and anger against
thee, the innocent, the guiltless; and they have received due
retribution for their misdeeds.”——And as the morn began to
dawn Shahrazad held her peace till</p>

<div class="nf-center c002">
    <div>The end of the Six Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Then said she:——I have heard, O auspicious King, that the
King spake kindly and fondly to his Consort, and told her all that
had betided him, and what the Speaking-Bird had made known to
him, ending with these words, “Come now with me to the palace
where thou shalt see thy two sons and daughter grown up to become
the loveliest of beings. Hie with me and embrace them and take
them to thy bosom, for they are our children, the light of our eyes.
But first do thou repair to the Hammám and don thy royal robes
and jewels.” Meanwhile tidings of these events were noised about
the city how the King had at length shown due favour to the Queen,
and had released her from bondage with his own hands and prayed
forgiveness for the wrongs he had done to her; and how the
Princes and the Princess had been proved to be her true-born
children, and also how that Khusrau Shah had punished her sisters
who conspired against her: so joy and gladness prevailed both in
city and kingdom, and all the folk blessed the Shah’s Bánú and
cursed the Satanesses her sisters. And next day when the Queen
had bathed in the Hammam and had donned royal dress and regal
jewels, she went to meet her children together with the King who
led up to her the Princes Bahman and Parwez and the Princess
Perizadah and said, “See, here are thy children, fruit of thy womb
and core of thy heart, thine own very sons and thy daughter:
embrace them with all a mother’s love and extend thy favour and
affection to them even as I have done. When thou didst give
them birth, thine ill-omened sisters bore them away from thee and
cast them into yonder stream and said that thou hadst been
delivered first of a puppy, then of a kitten and lastly of a musk-ratling.
I cannot console myself for having credited their calumnies
and the only recompense I can make is to place in thine embrace
these three thou broughtest forth, and whom Allah Almighty
hath restored to us and hath made right worthy to be called our
children.” Then the Princes and Princess fell upon their mother’s
neck and fondly embraced her weeping tear-floods of joy. After
this the Shah and the Banu sat down to meat together with their
children; and, when they had made an end of eating, King
Khusrau Shah repaired to the garden with his Consort that he
might show her the Singing-Tree and the fountain of Golden-Water,
whereat the Queen was filled with wonder and delight.
Next they turned to the belvedere and visited the Speaking-Bird
of whom, as they sat at meat, the King had spoken to her in
highest praise, and the Queen rejoiced in his sweet voice and
melodious singing. And when they had seen all these things,
the King mounted horse, Prince Bahman riding on his right
hand and on his left Prince Parwez, while the Queen took Princess
Perizadah with her inside her litter, and thus they set
forth for the palace. As the royal cavalcade passed the city walls
and entered the capital with royal pomp and circumstance,
the subjects who had heard the glad tidings thronged in multitudes
to see their progress and volleyed shouts of acclamation; and as
the lieges had grieved aforetime to see the Queen-consort
imprisoned, so now they rejoiced with exceeding joy to find her
free once more. But chiefly they marvelled to look upon the
Speaking-Bird, for the Princess carried the cage with her, and as
they rode along thousands of sweet-toned songsters came swarming
round them from every quarter, and flew as an escort to the cage,
filling the air with marvellous music; while flocks of others,
perching upon the trees and the housetops, carolled and warbled as
it were to greet their lord’s cage accompanying the royal cavalcade.
And when the palace was reached, the Shah and his Queen and his
children sat down to a sumptuous banquet; and the city was
illuminated, and everywhere dancings and merry-makings testified
to the joy of the lieges; and for many days these revels and
rejoicings prevailed throughout the capital and the kingdom where
every man was blithe and happy and had feastings and festivities in
his house. After these festivals King Khusrau Shah made his
elder son Bahman heir to his throne and kingdom and committed
to his hands the affairs of state in their entirety, and the Prince
administered affairs with such wisdom and success that the greatness
and glory of the realm were increased twofold. The Shah also
entrusted to his youngest son Parwez the charge of his army, both
of horsemen and foot-soldiers; and Princess Perizadah was given
by her sire in marriage to a puissant King who reigned over a
mighty country; and lastly the Queen-mother forgot in perfect
joy and happiness the pangs of her captivity. Destiny ever afterwards
endowed them, one and all, with days the most delectable
and they led the liefest of lives until at last there came to them the
Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies and the
Depopulator of palaces and the Garnerer of graveyards and the
Reaper for Resurrection-day, and they became as though they
never had been. So laud be to the Lord who dieth not and who
knoweth no shadow of change.</p>
