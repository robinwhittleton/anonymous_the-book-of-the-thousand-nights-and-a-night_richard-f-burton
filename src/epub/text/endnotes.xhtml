					<p>Debauched women prefer negroes on account of the size of their parts. I measured one man in Somali-land who, when quiescent, numbered nearly six inches. This is a characteristic of the negro race and of African animals: <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> the horse; whereas the pure Arab, man and beast, is below the average of Europe; one of the best proofs by the by, that the Egyptian is not an Asiatic, but a negro partially whitewashed. Moreover, these imposing parts do not increase proportionally during erection; consequently, the “deed of kind” takes a much longer time and adds greatly to the woman’s enjoyment. In my time no honest Hindi Moslem would take his womenfolk to Zanzibar on account of the huge attractions and enormous temptations there and thereby offered to them.

					<p>The Arab singular (whence the French “<span xml:lang="fr">génie</span>“); <abbr>fem.</abbr> Jinniyah; the Div and Rakshah of old Guebre-land and the “Rakshasa,” or “Yaksha,” of Hinduism. It would be interesting to trace the evident connection, by no means “accidental,” of “Jinn” with the “Genius” who came to the Romans through the Asiatic Etruscans, and whose name I cannot derive from <i xml:lang="el-Latn">gignomai</i> or <i xml:lang="la">genitus</i>. He was unknown to the Greeks, who had the Daimon (<i xml:lang="el">δαίμον</i>), a family which separated, like the Jinn and the Genius, into two categories, the good (Agatho-dæmons) and the bad (Kako-dæmons). We know nothing concerning the status of the Jinn amongst the pre-Moslemitic or pagan Arabs: the Moslems made him a supernatural anthropoid being, created of subtile fire (Koran, <abbr>chapts.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> 27; <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LV</span> 14), not of earth like man, propagating his kind, ruled by mighty kings, the last being Ján bin Ján, missionarised by Prophets and subject to death and Judgment. From the same root are <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Junún</i>=madness (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr>, possession or obsession by the Jinn) and <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Majnún</i>=a madman. According to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-titme">R.</abbr> Jeremiah bin Eliazar in Psalm <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLI</span> 5, Adam was excommunicated for one hundred and thirty years, during which he begat children in his own image (Gen. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 3) and these were Mazikeen or Shedeem⁠—Jinns.

					<p>Originally in Al-Islam the concubine (Surriyat, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) was a captive taken in war and the Koran says nothing about buying slave-girls. But if the captives were true believers the Moslem was ordered to marry not to keep them. In modern days concubinage has become an extensive subject. Practically the disadvantage is that the slave-girls, knowing themselves to be the master’s property, consider him bound to sleep with them; which is by no means the mistress’s view. Some wives, however, when old and childless, insist, after the fashion of Sarah, upon the husband taking a young concubine and treat her like a daughter⁠—which is rare. The Nights abound in tales of concubines, but these are chiefly owned by the Caliphs and high officials who did much as they pleased. The only redeeming point in the system is that it obviated the necessity of prostitution which is, perhaps, the greatest evil known to modern society. <a href="chapter-1-2.xhtml#noteref-45" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The Arab <dfn xml:lang="ar-Latn">Banj</dfn> and Hindú <i xml:lang="hi-Latn">Bhang</i> (which I use as most familiar) both derive from the old Coptic <i xml:lang="cop-Latn">Nibanj</i> meaning a preparation of hemp (<i epub:type="z3998:taxonomy">Cannabis sativa seu Indica</i>); and here it is easy to recognise the Homeric “Nepenthe.” Al-Kazwini explains the term by “garden hemp” (<i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Kinnab bostáni</i> or <i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Sháhdánaj</i>). On the other hand not a few apply the word to the henbane (<i epub:type="z3998:taxonomy">hyoscyamus niger</i>) so much used in mediæval Europe. The Kámús evidently means henbane distinguishing it from “<i xml:lang="ar-Latn">Hashish al haráfísh</i>”=rascals’ grass, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the herb Pantagruelion.

This would be the earliest form of smoking: it is still doubtful whether the pipe was used or not. Galen also mentions intoxication by hemp. Amongst Moslems, the Persians adopted the drink as an ecstatic, and about our thirteenth century Egypt, which began the practice, introduced a number of preparations to be noticed in the course of The Nights. <a href="chapter-1-3.xhtml#noteref-119" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Europeans have also learnt to miscall the Egyptians “Arabs”: the difference is as great as between an Englishman and a Spaniard. Arabs proper divide their race into sundry successive families. “The Arab al-Arabá” (or al-Aribah, or al-Urubíyat) are the autochthones, prehistoric, proto-historic and extinct tribes; for instance, a few of the Adites who being at Meccah escaped the destruction of their wicked nation, but mingled with other classes. The “Arab al-Mutaʼarribah,” (Arabised Arabs) are the first advenæ represented by such noble strains as the Koraysh (Koreish), some still surviving. The “Arab al-Mustaʼaribah,” (insititious, naturalised or instituted Arabs, men who claim to be Arabs) are Arabs like the Sinaites, the Egyptians and the Maroccans descended by intermarriage with other races. Hence our “Mosarabians” and the “Marrabais” of Rabelais (not, “a word compounded of Maurus and Arabs”). Some genealogists, however, make the Mutaʼarribah descendants of Kahtan (possible the Joktan of Genesis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, a comparatively modern document, <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 700?); and the Mustaʼaribah those descended from Adnán the origin of Arab genealogy. And, lastly, are the “Arab al-Mustaʼajimah,” barbarised Arabs, like the present population of Meccah and Al-Medinah. Besides these there are other tribes whose origin is still unknown; such as the Mahrah tribes of Hazramaut, the “Akhdám” (=serviles) of Oman (Maskat); and the “Ebná” of Al-Yaman: Ibn Ishak supposes the latter to be descended from the Persian soldiers of Anushirwan who expelled the Abyssinian invader from Southern Arabia.

					<p>A “Court hand” says <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Payne (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 112): I know nothing of it. Other hands are: the Taʼalík; hanging or oblique, used for finer <abbr>MSS.</abbr> and having, according to Richardson, “the same analogy to the Naskhi as our Italic has to the Roman.” The Nasta’ lík (not Naskh-Taʼalík) much used in India, is, as the name suggests, a mixture of the Naskhi (writing of transactions) and the Taʼalík. The Shikastah (broken hand) everywhere represents our running hand and becomes a hard task to the reader. The Kirmá is another cursive character, mostly confined to the receipts and disbursements of the Turkish treasury. The Diváni, or Court (of Justice) is the official hand, bold and round, a business character, the lines often rising with a sweep or curve towards the (left) end. The Jáli or polished has a variety, the Jali-Taʼalik: the Sulsi (known in many books) is adopted for titles of volumes, royal edicts, diplomas and so forth; “answering much the same purpose as capitals with us, or the flourished letters in illuminated manuscripts” (Richardson). The Tughrái is that of the Tughrá, the Prince’s cypher or flourishing signature in ceremonial writings, and containing some such sentence as: Let this be executed. There are others <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> Yákuti and Sirenkil known only by name.

But Orientals are aware that the period of especial feminine devilry is between the first menstruation and twenty when, according to some, every girl is a “possible murderess.” So they wisely marry her and get rid of what is called the “lump of grief,” the “domestic calamity”⁠—a daughter. Amongst them we never hear of the abominable egotism and cruelty of the English mother, who disappoints her daughter’s womanly cravings in order to keep her at home for her own comfort; and an “old maid” in the house, especially a stout, plump old maid, is considered not “respectable.” The ancient virgin is known by being lean and scraggy; and perhaps this diagnosis is correct. <a href="chapter-1-6.xhtml#noteref-400" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The Damascus “Maristan” was described by every traveller of the last century: and it showed a curious contrast between the treatment of the maniac and the idiot or omadhaun, who is humanely allowed to wander about unharmed, if not held a Saint.

					<p>Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLVIII</span>, 8. It may be observed that according to the Ahádis (sayings of the Prophet) and the Sunnat (sayings and doings of Mahommed), all the hair should be allowed to grow or the whole head be clean shaven. Hence the “Shúshah,” or topknot supposed to be left as a handle for drawing the wearer into Paradise; and the Zulf, or side-locks, somewhat like the ringlets of the Polish Jews, are both vain “Bidaʼat,” or innovations, and therefore technically termed “Makrúh,” a practice not laudable, neither “Halál” (perfectly lawful) nor “Harám” (forbidden by the law). When boys are first shaved, generally in the second or third year, a tuft is left on the crown and another over the forehead: but this is not the fashion amongst adults. Abu Hanifah, if I am rightly informed, wrote a treatise on the Shushah or long lock growing from the Násiyah (head-poll) which is also a precaution lest the decapitated Moslem’s mouth be defiled by an impure hand; and thus it would resemble the chivalry-lock by which the Redskin brave (and even the “cowboy” of better times) facilitated the removal of his own scalp. Possibly the Turks had learned the practice from the Chinese and introduced it into Baghdad (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, 240). The Badawi plait their locks in Kurún (horns) or Jadáil (ringlets) which are undone only to be washed with the water of the she-camel.

					<p>This form of blessing is chaunted from the Minaret about half-an-hour before midday, when the worshippers take their places in the mosque. At noon there is the usual Azán or prayer-call, and each man performs a two-bow, in honour of the mosque and its gathering, as it were. The Prophet is then blessed and a second Salám is called from the raised ambo or platform (“dikkah”) by the divines who repeat the midday-call. Then an Imam recites the first Khutbah, or sermon “of praise”; and the congregation worships in silence. This is followed by the second exhortation “of Waʼaz,” dispensing the words of wisdom. The Imam now stands up before the Mihráb (prayer niche) and recites the Ikámah which is the common Azan with one only difference: after “Hie ye to salvation” it adds “Come is the time of supplication”; whence the name, “causing” (prayer) to stand (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> to begin).

They could always obtain food, especially as Muʼezzins; and were preferred because they could not take advantage of the minaret by spying into their neighbours’ households. The Egyptian race is chronically weak-eyed, the effect of the damp hot climate of the valley, where ophthalmia prevailed even during the pre-Pharaohnic days. The great Sesostris died stone-blind and his successor lost his sight for ten years (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, 176). That the Fellahs are now congenitally weak-eyed, may by seen by comparing them with negroes imported from Central Africa.

					<p>The allusion is Koranic: “O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that he first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam); afterwards of seed” (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXII</span>). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXXVI</span>); that the mingled seed of the two (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXVI</span>) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and Dímnah) says:⁠—“Man’s seed, falling into the woman’s womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother’s back; if a female, towards her belly. (P. 262, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> I. G. N. Keith-Falconer’s translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>), “Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;” and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam’s back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came.” From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans; and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of <span xml:lang="la">generatio ex animalculis in semine marium</span>. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast=the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated “Art thou not with thy Lord?” (Alasta bi Rabbi-kum); and they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator. <a href="chapter-2-3.xhtml#noteref-871" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birman wood).

According to Pocock (Notæ Spec. Hist. Arab.): “Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehamah, (belonging to Al-Medinah, Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited.” Tehamah (tierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al-Hijaz, the Moslem’s Holy Land; and its “Arabah,” a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of “Arab” from “Yaʼarab” a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called “Eretz Ereb” (or “Arab”)=land of the West; but in Arabic “Gharb” (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew. <a href="chapter-2-3.xhtml#noteref-940" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep-set eyes and thin-cheeked, of slender build and lean-loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard.

					<p>Arab. “Sahákah,” lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this “Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love”; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as “bazar” (<span xml:lang="ar">بظر</span>), hence Tabzír=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates “Bazarah” by slut or wench. He adds “it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entitle Zambúr and which are cut off in girlhood.” See also Lane, Lex. <abbr>s.v.</abbr>; Tabzír. Both writers confuse excision of the nymphæ with circumcision of the clitoris (Zambúr). Al-Siyúti (Kitab al-Izá’ fiʼIlm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as “Gamiani,” and “<span xml:lang="fr">Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef</span>,” Lesbos, 1778. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls’ schools tallow-candles and similar succedania are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe. <a href="chapter-2-3.xhtml#noteref-1109" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Tor is “Mount Sinai” in the Koran (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XCV</span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: “It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 527. Ras Safsáfah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the South is the property of Rüppell” (Midian Revisited <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, 237.). I would therefore call the “Sinaitic” Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Aráif, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj-road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes “Sainá” and “Sínín”) there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root “Sanah”=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with “Sin,” the Assyrian Moon-god, as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Baʼal Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius. <a href="chapter-2-3.xhtml#noteref-1122" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Arab. “Majlis” = sitting. The postures of coition, <span xml:lang="fr">ethnologically</span> curious and interesting, are subjects so extensive that they require a volume rather than a note. Full information can be found in the Ananga-ranga, or Stage of the Bodiless One, a treatise in Sanskrit verse vulgarly known as Koka Pandit from the supposed author, a Wazir of the great Rajah Bhoj or, according to others, of the Maharajah of Kanoj. Under the title Lizzat al-Nisá (The Pleasures⁠—or enjoying⁠—of Women) it has been translated into all the languages of the Moslem East, from Hindustani to Arabic. It divides postures into five great divisions: (1) the woman lying supine, of which there are eleven subdivisions; (2) lying on her side, right or left, with three varieties; (3) sitting, which has ten; (4) standing, with three subdivisions, and (5) lying prone, with two. This total of twenty-nine, with three forms of “Purusháyit,” when the man lies supine (see the Abbot in Boccaccio <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 4), becomes thirty-two, approaching the French <i xml:lang="fr">quarante façons</i>. The Upavishta, majlis, or sitting postures, when one or both “sit at squat” somewhat like birds, appear utterly impossible to Europeans who lack the pliability of the Eastern’s limbs. Their object in congress is to avoid tension of the muscles which would shorten the period of enjoyment. In the text the woman lies supine and the man sits at squat between her legs: it is a favourite from Marocco to China. A literal translation of the Ananga-ranga appeared in 1873 under the name of Káma-Shástra; or the Hindoo Art of Love (<span xml:lang="la">Ars Amoris Indica</span>); but of this only six copies were printed. It was re-issued (printed but not published) in 1885.

					<p>Arab. “Dara’ ” or “Dira’,” a habergeon, a coat of ring-mail, sometimes worn in pairs.

It is easy to make these hauberks arrow-proof or sword-proof, even bullet-proof if Arab gunpowder be used: but against a modern rifle-cone they are worse than worthless as the fragments would be carried into the wound.

					<p>This is one of the lucky signs and adds to the value of the beast. There are some fifty of these marks, some of them (like a spiral of hair in the breast which denotes that the rider is a cuckold) so ill-omened that the animal can be bought for almost nothing. Of course great attention is paid to colours, the best being the dark rich bay (“red” of Arabs) with black points, or the flea-bitten grey (termed Azrak = blue or Akhzar = green) which whitens with age. The worst are dun, cream coloured, piebald and black, which last are very rare. Yet according to the Mishkát al-Masábih (Lane 2, 54) Mohammed said, “The best horses are black (dark brown?) with white blazes (Arab. “Ghurrah”) and upper lips; next, black with blaze and three white legs (bad, because white-hoofs are brittle): next, bay with white blaze and white fore and hind legs.” He also said, “Prosperity is with sorrel horses;” and praised a sorrel with white forehead and legs; but he dispraised the “Shikál” which has white stockings (Arab. “Muhajjil”) on alternate hoofs (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> right hind and left fore).

					<p>The Comrades of the Cave, famous in the Middle Ages of Christianity (Gibbon <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIII</span>), is an article of faith with Moslems, being part subject of chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span>, the Koranic Surah termed the Cave. These Ripp Van Winkle-tales begin with Endymion so famous amongst the Classics and Epimenides of Crete who slept fifty-seven years; and they extend to modern days as <span xml:lang="fr">La Belle au Bois dormant</span>. The Seven Sleepers are as many youths of Ephesus (six royal councillors and a shepherd, whose names are given on the authority of Ali); and, accompanied by their dog, they fled the persecutions of Dakianús (the Emperor Decius) to a cave near Tarsús in Natolia where they slept for centuries. The Caliph Muʼawiyah when passing the cave sent into it some explorers who were all killed by a burning wind. The number of the sleepers remains uncertain, according to the Koran (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 21) three, five or seven; and their sleep lasted either three hundred or three hundred and nine years. The dog (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 17) slept at the cave-entrance with paws outstretched and, according to the general, was called “Katmir” or “Kitmir;” but Al-Rakím (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 8) is also applied to it by some. Others hold this to be the name of the valley or mountain and others of a stone or leaden tablet on which their names were engraved by their countrymen who built a chapel on the spot (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 20). Others again make the Men of Al-Rakím distinct from the Cave-men, and believe (with Bayzáwi) that they were three youths who were shut up in a grotto by a rock-slip. Each prayed for help through the merits of some good deed: when the first had adjured Allah the mountain cracked till light appeared; at the second petition it split so that they saw one another and after the third it opened. However that may be, Kitmir is one of the seven favoured animals; the others being the Hudhud (hoopoe) of Solomon (Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXII</span> 20); the she-camel of Sálih (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXXVII</span>); the cow of Moses which named the Second Surah; the fish of Jonah; the serpent of Eve; and the peacock of Paradise.

These fangs are always drawn by the jugglers but they grow again and thus many lives are lost. The popular way of extracting the crochets is to grasp the snake firmly behind the neck with one hand and with the other to tantalise it by offering and withdrawing a red rag. At last the animal is allowed to strike it and a sharp jerk tears out both eye-teeth as rustics used to do by slamming a door. The head is then held downwards and the venom drains from its bag in the shape of a few drops of slightly yellowish fluid which, as conjurers know, may be drunk without danger. The patient looks faint and dazed, but recovers after a few hours and feeds as if nothing had happened.

They can possess property and will it away without the husband’s leave: they can absent themselves from the house for a month without his having a right to complain; and they assist in all his counsels for the best of reasons: a man can rely only on his wives and children, being surrounded by rivals who hope to rise by his ruin.

Fact, however, in low-lying lands, like Persian Mazanderan versus the Plateau; Indian Malabar compared with Marátha-land; California as opposed to Utah and especially Egypt contrasted with Arabia. In these hot-damp climates the venereal requirements and reproductive powers of the female greatly exceed those of the male; and hence the dissoluteness of morals would be phenomenal, were it not obviated by seclusion, the sabre and the revolver.

					<p>“Long beard and little wits,” is a saying throughout the East where the Kausaj (= man with thin, short beard) is looked upon as cunning and tricksy. There is a venerable Joe Miller about a schoolmaster who, wishing to singe his long beard short, burnt it off and his face to boot:⁠—which reminded him of the saying. A thick beard is defined as one which wholly conceals the skin; and in ceremonial ablution it must be combed out with the fingers till the water reach the roots. The Sunnat, or practice of the Prophet, was to wear the beard not longer than one hand and two fingers’ breadth. In Persian “Kúseh” (thin-beard) is an insulting term opposed to “Khush-rísh,” a well-bearded man. The Iranian growth is perhaps the finest in the world, often extending to the waist; but it gives infinite trouble, requiring, for instance, a bag when travelling. The Arab beard is often composed of two tufts on the chin-sides and straggling hairs upon the cheeks; and this is a severe mortification, especially to Shaykhs and elders, who not only look upon the beard as one of man’s characteristics, but attach a religious importance to the appendage. Hence the enormity of Kamar al-Zaman’s behaviour. The Persian festival of the vernal equinox was called Kuseh-nishín (Thin-beard sitting). An old man with one eye paraded the streets on an ass with a crow in one hand and a scourge and fan in the other, cooling himself, flogging the bystanders and crying heat! heat! (garmá! garmá!).

					<p>Bin Yúsuf al-Sakafi, a statesman and soldier of the seventh and eighth centuries (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr>).

He pulled down the Kaʼabah and restored it to the condition in which it now is. Al-Siyuti (<abbr>p.</abbr> 219) accuses him of having suborned a man to murder Ibn Omar with a poisoned javelin, and of humiliating the Prophet’s companions by “sealing them in the necks and hands,” that is he tied a thong upon the neck of each and sealed the knot with lead. In Irak he showed himself equally masterful; but an iron hand was required by the revolutionists of Kufah and Basrah. He behaved like a good Knight in rescuing the Moslem women who called upon his name when taken prisoners by Dahir of Debal (Tathá in Sind). Al-Hajjaj was not the kind of man the Caliph would have chosen for a pander; but the Shiʼahs hated him and have given him a lasting bad name. In the East men respect manly measures, not the hysterical, philanthropic pseudo-humanitarianism of our modern government which is really the cruellest of all. When Ziyád bin Abihi was sent by Caliph Muʼawiyah to reform Bassorah, a den of thieves, he informed the lieges that he intended to rule by the sword and advised all evil-doers to quit the city. The people were forbidden, under pain of death, to walk the streets after prayers; on the first night two hundred suffered; on the second five and none afterwards. Compare this with our civilised rule in Egypt where even bands of brigands, a phenomenon perfectly new and unknown to this century, have started up, where crime has doubled in quantity and quality, and where “Christian rule” has thoroughly scandalised a Moslem land. <a href="chapter-4-1.xhtml#noteref-1641" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Several recipes are given by Herklots (Glossary <abbr>s.v.</abbr> Majoon). These electuaries are usually prepared with “Charas,” or gum of hemp, collected by hand or by passing a blanket over the plant in early morning, and it is highly intoxicating. Another intoxicant is “Sabzi,” dried hemp-leaves, poppy-seed, cucumber-seed, black pepper and cardamoms rubbed down in a mortar with a wooden pestle, and made drinkable by adding milk, ice-cream, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> The Hashish of Arabia is the Hindustani Bhang, usually drunk and made as follows. Take of hemp-leaves, well washed, 3 drams; black pepper 45 grains and of cloves, nutmeg and mace (which add to the intoxication) each 12 grains. Triturate in 8 ounces of water or the juice of watermelon or cucumber, strain and drink. The Egyptian Zabíbah is a preparation of hemp-florets, opium and honey, much affected by the lower orders, whence the proverb: “Temper thy sorrow with Zabibah,.” In Al-Hijaz it is mixed with raisins (Zabíb) and smoked in the water-pipe.

					<p>The <abbr>Bresl.</abbr> <abbr>Edit.</abbr> (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 171⁠–⁠174) entitles this tale, “Story of Shaddád bin Ad and the City of Iram the Columned;” but it relates chiefly the building by the King of the First Adites who, being promised a future Paradise by Prophet Húd, impiously said that he would lay out one in this world. It also quotes Kaʼab al-Ahbár as an authority for declaring that the tale is in the “Pentateuch of Moses.” Iram was in al-Yaman near Adan (our Aden) a square of ten parasangs (or leagues each = 18,000 feet) every way; the walls were of red (baked) brick 500 cubits high and 20 broad, with four gates of corresponding grandeur. It contained 300,000 Kasr (palaces) each with a thousand pillars of gold-bound jasper, <abbr>etc.</abbr> (whence its title). The whole was finished in five hundred years; and, when Shaddad prepared to enter it, the “Cry of Wrath” from the Angel of Death slew him and all his many. It is mentioned in the Koran (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXXIX</span> 6⁠–⁠7) as “Irem adorned with lofty buildings (or pillars).” But Ibn Khaldun declares that commentators have embroidered the passage; Iram being the name of a powerful clan of the ancient Adites and “imád” being a tent-pole: hence “Iram with the numerous tents or tent-poles.” Al-Bayzawi tells the story of Abdullah ibn Kilabah (D’Herbelot’s Colabah). At Aden I met an Arab who had seen the mysterious city on the borders of Al-Ahkáf, the waste of deep sands, west of Hadramaut; and probably he had, the mirage or sun-reek taking its place.

					<p>Arab. “Fúl al-hárr” = beans like horsebeans soaked and boiled as opposed to the “Fúl Mudammas” (esp. of Egypt) = unshelled beans steamed and boiled all night and eaten with linseed oil as “kitchen” or relish. Lane (M. E., <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>) calls them after the debased Cairene pronunciation, Mudemmes. A legend says that, before the days of Pharaoh (always he of Moses), the Egyptians lived on pistachios which made them a witty, lively race. But the tyrant remarking that the domestic ass, which eats beans, is degenerate from the wild ass, uprooted the pistachio-trees and compelled the lieges to feed on beans which made them a heavy, gross, cowardly people fit only for burdens. Badawis deride “bean-eaters” although they do not loathe the pulse like onions. The principal result of a bean diet is an extraordinary development of flatulence both in stomach and intestines: hence, possibly, Pythagoras who had studied ceremonial purity in Egypt, forbade the use, unless he referred to venery or political business. I was once sitting in the Greek quarter of Cairo dressed as a Moslem when arose a prodigious hubbub of lads and boys, surrounding a couple of Fellahs. These men had been working in the fields about a mile east of Cairo; and, when returning home, one had said to the other, “If thou wilt carry the hoes I will break wind once for every step we take.” He was as good as his word and when they were to part he cried, “And now for thy bakhshish!” which consisted of a volley of fifty, greatly to the delight of the boys. <a href="chapter-4-16.xhtml#noteref-1861" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Most ingenious were Kara Gyuz’s little ways of driving on an obstinate donkey and of tackling a huge Anatolian pilgrim. He mounted the Neddy’s back, face to tail, and inserting his left thumb like a clyster, hammered it with his right, when the donkey started at speed. For the huge pilgrim he used a ladder.

The old Guebres called it Pul-i-Chinávar or Chinávad and the Jews borrowed it from them as they did all their fancies of a future life against which Moses had so gallantly fought. It is said that a bridge over the grisly “brook Kedron” was called Sirát (the road) and hence the idea, as that of hell-fire from Ge-Hinnom (Gehenna) where children were passed through the fire to Moloch.

The popular preparation (called Núrah) consists of quicklime 7 parts, and Zirník or orpiment, 3 parts: it is applied in the Hammam to a perspiring skin, and it must be washed off immediately the hair is loosened or it burns and discolours. The rest of the body-pile (Shaʼarat opp. to Shaʼar = hair) is eradicated by applying a mixture of boiled honey with turpentine or other gum, and rolling it with the hand till the hair comes off. Men I have said remove the pubes by shaving, and pluck the hair of the armpits, one of the vestages of pre-Adamite man. A good depilatory is still a desideratum, the best perfumers of London and Paris have none which they can recommend.

					<p>The well-known capital of Al-Yaman, a true Arabia Felix, a Paradise inhabited by demons in the shape of Turkish soldiery and Arab caterans. According to Moslem writers Sanaʼa was founded by Shem son of Noah who, wandering southward with his posterity after his father’s death, and finding the site delightful, dug a well and founded the citadel, Ghamdán, which afterwards contained a <i xml:lang="fr">Maison Carrée</i> rivalling (or attempting to rival) the Meccan Kaʼabah. The builder was Surahbíl who, says M. C. de Perceval coloured its four faces red, white, golden and green; the central quadrangle had seven stories (the planets) each forty cubits high, and the lowest was a marble hall ceiling’d with a single slab. At the four corners stood hollow lions through whose mouths the winds roared. This palatial citadel-temple was destroyed by order of Caliph Omar. The city’s ancient name was Azal or Uzal whom some identify with one of the thirteen sons of Joktan (Genesis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 27): it took its present name from the Ethiopian conquerors (they say) who, seeing it for the first time, cried “Hazá Sanaʼah!” meaning in their tongue, this is commodious, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> I may note that the word is Kisawahili (Zanzibarian) <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> “Yámbo <em>sáná</em>⁠—is the state <em>good</em>?” Sanaʼa was the capital of the Tabábiʼah or Tobba Kings who judaized; and the Abyssinians with their Negush made it Christian while the Persians under Anushirwán converted it to Guebrism.

Europeans ignoring the science and practice, are contemptuously compared with village-cocks by Hindu women who cannot be satisfied, such is their natural coldness, increased doubtless by vegetable diet and unuse of stimulants, with less than twenty minutes.

					<p>Arab. “Al-Khutnah.” Nowhere commanded in the Koran and being only a practice of the Prophet, the rite is not indispensable for converts, especially the aged and the sick. Our ideas upon the subject are very hazy for modern “niceness” allows a “Feast of the Circumcision,” but no discussion thereon. Moses (alias Osarsiph) borrowed the rite from the Egyptian hierophants who were all thus “purified”; the object being to counteract the over-sensibility of the “sixth sense” and to harden the <i xml:lang="la">glans</i> against abrasions and infection by exposure to air and friction against the dress. Almost all African tribes practise it but the modes vary and some are exceedingly curious: I shall notice a peculiarly barbarous fashion called Al-Salkh (the flaying) still practised in the Arabian province Al-Asír (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 80). There is a difference too between the Hebrew and the Moslem rite. The Jewish operator, after snipping off the foreskin, rips up the prepuce with his sharp thumb-nails so that the external cutis does not retract far from the internal; and the wound, when healed, shows a narrow ring of cicatrice. This ripping is not done by Moslems. They use a stick as a probe passed round between glans and prepuce to ascertain the extent of the frenum and that there is no abnormal adhesion. The foreskin is then drawn forward and fixed by the forceps, a fork of two bamboo splints, five or six inches long by a quarter thick, or in some cases an iron like our compasses. This is tied tightly over the foreskin so as to exclude about an inch and a half of the prepuce above and three quarters below. A single stroke of the razor drawn directly downwards removes the skin. The slight bleeding is stopped by burnt rags or ashes and healed with cerates, pledgets and fumigations. Thus Moslem circumcision does not prevent the skin retracting. <a href="chapter-5-55.xhtml#noteref-2418" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Rajab (<abbr>No.</abbr> 7) = “worshipping,” especially by sacrifice, is also known as Al-Asamm the deaf; because being sacred, the rattle of arms was unheard. Shaʼabán = “collecting,” dispersing, ruining, because the tribal wars recommenced: Ramazan (intensely hot) has been explained and Shawwál (<abbr>No.</abbr> 10.) derives from Shaul (elevating) when the he-camels raise their tails in rut.

He spoke when a babe in cradle; he performed miracles of physic; he was taken up to Heaven; he will appear as the forerunner of Mohammed on the White Tower of Damascus, and finally he will be buried at Al-Medinah. The Jews on the other hand speak of him as “that man:” they hold that he was begotten by Joseph during the menstrual period and therefore a born magician. Moreover he learned the Sham ha-maphrash or Nomen tetragrammaton, wrote it on parchment and placed it in an incision in his thigh, which closed up on the Name being mentioned (Buxtorf, Lex Talmud 25⁠–⁠41).

					<p>The popular English idea of the Arab horse is founded upon utter unfact. Book after book tells us, “There are three distinct breeds of Arabians⁠—the <em>Attechi</em>, a very superior breed; the <em>Kadishi</em>, mixed with these and of little value; and the <em>Kochlani</em>, highly prized and very difficult to procure.” “Attechi” may be At-Tází (the Arab horse, or hound) or some confusion with “At” (Turk.) a horse. “Kadish” (Gadish or Kidish) is a nag; a gelding, a hackney, a “pacer” (generally called “Rahwán”). “Kochlani” is evidently “Kohláni,” the Kohl-eyed, because the skin round the orbits is dark as if powdered. This is the true blue blood; and the bluest of all is “Kohláni al-Ajúz” (of the old woman) a name thus accounted for. An Arab mare dropped a filly when in flight; her rider perforce gallopped on and presently saw the foal appear in camp, when it was given to an old woman for nursing and grew up to be famous. The home of the Arab horse is the vast plateau of Al-Najd: the Tahámah or lower maritime regions of Arabia, like Malabar, will not breed good beasts. The pure blood all descends from five collateral lines called Al-Khamsah (the Cinque). Literary and pedantic Arabs derive them from the mares of Mohammed a native of the dry and rocky region, Al-Hijaz, whither horses are all imported. Others go back (with the Koran, <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVIII</span>) to Solomon, possibly Salmán, a patriarch fourth in descent from Ishmael and some 600 years older than the Hebrew King. The Badawi derive the five from Rabíʼat al-Faras (R. of the mare) fourth in descent from Adnán, the fount of Arab genealogy. But they differ about the names: those generally given are Kahilan (Kohaylat), Sakláwi (which the Badawin pronounce Sagláwi), Abayán, and Hamdáni; others substitute Manákhi (the long-maned), Tanís and Jalfún. These require no certificate amongst Arabs; for strangers a simple statement is considered enough. The Badawin despise all half-breeds (Arab sires and country mares), Syrian, Turkish, Kurdish and Egyptian. They call these (first mentioned in the reign of Ahmes, <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 1600) the “sons of horses”; as opposed to “sons of mares,” or thorough-breds. Nor do they believe in city-bred animals. I have great doubts concerning our old English sires, such as the Darley Arabian which looks like a Kurdish half-bred, the descendant of those Cappadocians so much prized by the Romans: in Syria I rode a “Harfúshí” (Kurd) the very image of it. There is no difficulty in buying Arab stallions except the price. Of course the tribe does not like to part with what may benefit the members generally; but offers of £500 to £1,000 would overcome men’s scruples. It is different with mares, which are almost always the joint property of several owners. The people too dislike to see a hat on a thorough-bred mare: “What hast thou done that thou art ridden by that ill-omened Kafir?” the Badawin used to mutter when they saw a highly respectable missionary at Damascus mounting a fine Ruwalá mare. The feeling easily explains the many wars about horses occurring in Arab annals, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> about Dáhis and Ghabrá.

The title is variously explained, from two protuberances on his head or helm, from two long locks and, possibly, from the ram-horns of Jupiter Ammon. The anecdote in the text seems suggested by the famous interview (probably a <i xml:lang="fr">canard</i>) with Diogenes: see in the Gesta, Tale <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CXLVI</span>. “The answer of Diomedes the Pirate to Alexander.” Iskandar was originally called Marzbán (Lord of the Marches), son of Marzabah; and, though descended from Yunán, son of Japhet, the eponymus of the Greeks, was born obscure, the son of an old woman. According to the Persians he was the son of the Elder Dáráb (Darius Codomannus of the Kayanian or Second dynasty), by a daughter of Philip of Macedon; and was brought up by his grandfather. When Abraham and Isaac had rebuilt the Kaʼabah they foregathered with him and Allah sent him forth against the four quarters of the earth to convert men to the faith of the Friend or to cut their throats; thus he became one of the four world-conquerors with Nimrod, Solomon, Bukht al-Nasr (Nabochodonosor); and he lived down two generations of men. His Wazir was Aristú (the Greek Aristotle) and he carried a couple of flags, white and black, which made day and night for him and facilitated his conquests. At the end of Persia, where he was invited by the people, on account of the cruelty of his half brother Darab <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, he came upon two huge mountains on the same line, behind which dwelt a host of abominable pygmies, two spans high, with curious eyes, ears which served as mattresses and coverlets, huge fanged mouths, lions’ claws and hairy hind quarters. They ate men, destroyed everything, copulated in public and had swarms of children. These were Yájúj and Májúj (Gog and Magog) descendants of Japhet. Sikandar built against them the famous wall with stones cemented and riveted by iron and copper. The “Great Wall” of China, the famous bulwark against the Tartars dates from <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 320; (Alexander of Macedon died <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 324) and as the Arabs knew Canton well before Mohammed’s day, they may have built their romance upon it.

He finds a stone of special excellence which he calls Almás (diamond); and he obtains it from the Valley of Serpents by throwing down flesh to the eagles.

					<p>A saying of Mohammed is recorded “Al-fakru fakhrí” (poverty is my pride!), intelligible in a man who never wanted for anything. Here he is diametrically opposed to Ali who honestly abused poverty; and the Prophet seems to have borrowed from Christendom, whose “Lazarus and Dives” shows a man sent to Hell because he enjoyed a very modified Heaven in this life and which suggested that one of the man’s greatest miseries is an ecclesiastical virtue⁠—“Holy Poverty”⁠—represented in the Church as a bride young and lovely. If a “rich man can hardly enter the kingdom” what must it be with a poor man whose conditions are far more unfavourable? Going to the other extreme we may say that Poverty is the root of all evil and the more so as it curtails man’s power of benefiting others. Practically I observe that those who preach and praise it the most, practise it the least willingly: the ecclesiastic has always some special reasons, a church or a school is wanted; but not the less he wishes for more money. In Syria this Holy Poverty leads to strange abuses. At Bayrut I recognised in most impudent beggars well-to-do peasants from the Kasrawán district, and presently found out that whilst their fields were under snow they came down to the coast, enjoyed a genial climate and lived on alms. When I asked them if they were not ashamed to beg, they asked me if I was ashamed of following in the footsteps of the Saviour and Apostles.

					<p>Moslems like the Classics (Aristotle and others) hold the clitoris (<em>Zambúr</em>) to be the <span xml:lang="la">sedes et scaturigo veneris</span> which, says Sonnini, is mere profanity. In the babe it protrudes beyond the labiæ and snipping off the head forms female circumcision. This rite is supposed by Moslems to have been invented by Sarah who so mutilated Hagar for jealousy and was afterwards ordered by Allah to have herself circumcised at the same time as Abraham. It is now (or should be) universal in Al-Islam and no Arab would marry a girl “unpurified” by it. Son of an “uncircumcised” mother (Ibn al-bazrá) is a sore insult. As regards the popular idea that Jewish women were circumcised till the days of Rabbi Gershom (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1000) who denounced it as a scandal to the Gentiles, the learned <abbr>Prof.</abbr> H. Graetz informs me, with some indignation, that the rite was never practised and that the great Rabbi contended only against polygamy. Female circumcision, however, is I believe the rule amongst some outlying tribes of Jews. The rite is the proper complement of male circumcision, evening the sensitiveness of the genitories by reducing it equally in both sexes: an uncircumcised woman has the venereal orgasm much sooner and oftener than a circumcised man, and frequent coitus would injure her health; hence I believe, despite the learned historian, that it is practised by some Eastern Jews. “Excision” is universal amongst the negroids of the Upper Nile (Werne), the Somál and other adjacent tribes. The operator, an old woman, takes up the instrument, a knife or razor-blade fixed into a wooden handle, and with three sweeps cuts off the labia and the head of the clitoris. The parts are then sewn up with a pack-needle and a thread of sheepskin; and in Dar-For a tin tube is inserted for the passage of urine. Before marriage the bridegroom trains himself for a month on beef, honey and milk; and, if he can open his bride with the natural weapon, he is a sworder to whom no woman in the tribe can deny herself. If he fail, he tries penetration with his fingers and by way of last resort whips out his whittle and cuts the parts open. The sufferings of the first few nights must be severe. The few Somáli prostitutes who practised at Aden always had the labiæ and clitoris excised and the skin showing the scars of coarse sewing. The moral effect of female circumcision is peculiar. While it diminishes the heat of passion it increases licentiousness, and breeds a debauchery of mind far worse than bodily unchastity, because accompanied by a peculiar cold cruelty and a taste for artificial stimulants to “luxury.” It is the sexlessness of a spayed canine imitated by the suggestive brain of humanity. <a href="chapter-5-68.xhtml#noteref-2560" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The ruby is supposed by Moslems to be a common mineral thoroughly “cooked” by the sun, and produced only on the summits of mountains inaccessible even to Alpinists. The idea may have originated from exaggerated legends of the Badakhshán country (supposed to be the home of the ruby) and its terrors of break-neck foot-paths, jagged peaks and horrid ravines: hence our “<em>balass</em>-ruby” through the Spanish corruption “Balaxe.” Epiphanius, archbishop of Salamis in Cyprus, who died <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 403, gives, in a little treatise (<span xml:lang="la">De duodecim gemmis rationalis summi sacerdotis Hebræorum Liber, opera Fogginii</span>, Romæ, 1743, <abbr>p.</abbr> 30), a precisely similar description of the mode of finding jacinths in Scythia. “In a wilderness in the interior of Great Scythia,” he writes, “there is a valley begirt with stony mountains as with walls. It is inaccessible to man, and so excessively deep that the bottom of the valley is invisible from the top of the surrounding mountains. So great is the darkness that it has the effect of a kind of chaos. To this place certain criminals are condemned, whose task it is to throw down into the valley slaughtered lambs, from which the skin has been first taken off. The little stones adhere to these pieces of flesh. Thereupon the eagles, which live on the summits of the mountains, fly down following the scent of the flesh, and carry away the lambs with the stones adhering to them. They, then, who are condemned to this place, watch until the eagles have finished their meal, and run and take away the stones.” Epiphanius, who wrote this, is spoken of in terms of great respect by many ecclesiastical writers, and <abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome styles the treatise here quoted, “<span xml:lang="la">Egregium volumen, quod si legere volueris, plenissimam scientiam consequeris</span>;” and, indeed, it is by no means improbable that it was from the account of Epiphanius that this story was first translated into Arabic. A similar account is given by Marco Polo and by Nicolò de Conti, as of a usage which they had heard was practised in India, and the position ascribed to the mountain by Conti, namely, fifteen days’ journey north of Vijanagar, renders it highly probable that Golconda was alluded to. He calls the mountain Albenigaras, and says that it was infested with serpents. Marco Polo also speaks of these serpents, and while his account agrees with that of Sindbad, inasmuch as the serpents, which are the prey of Sindbad’s Rukh, are devoured by the Venetian’s eagles, that of Conti makes the vultures and eagles fly away with the meat to places where they may be safe from the serpents.

					<p>It is not easy to explain this passage unless it be a garbled allusion to the steel-plate of the diamond-cutter.

Diamonds occur in alluvial lands mostly open and comparatively level, as in India, the Brazil and the Cape. Archbishop Epiphanius of Salamis (ob. <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 403) tells this story about the jacinth or ruby (Epiphanii Opera, a Petaio, Coloniæ 1682); and it was transferred to the diamond by Marco Polo (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 29, “of Eagles bring up diamonds”) and Nicolò de Conti, whose “mountain Albenigaras” must be Vijayanagar in the kingdom of Golconda. Major Rennel places the famous mines of Pauna or Purna in a mountain-tract of more than 200 miles square to the south-west of the Jumna. Al-Kazwini locates the “Chaos” in the “Valley of the Moon amongst the mountains of Serendib” (Ceylon); the Chinese tell the same tale in the campaigns of Hulaku; and it is known in Armenia. <abbr>Col.</abbr> Yule (M.

The classicists of course find the Shaykh of the Sea in the Tritons and Nereus, and Bochart (Hiero. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 858, 880) notices the homo aquaticus, Senex Judæus and Senex Marinus.

					<p>In parts of West Africa and especially in Gorilla-land there are many stories of women and children being carried off by apes, and all believe that the former bear issue to them. It is certain that the anthropoid ape is lustfully excited by the presence of women and I have related how at Cairo (1856) a huge cynocephalus would have raped a girl had it not been bayonetted. Young ladies who visited the Demidoff Gardens and menagerie at Florence were often scandalised by the vicious exposure of the baboons’ parti-coloured persons. The female monkey equally solicits the attentions of man and I heard in India from my late friend, Mirza Ali Akbar of Bombay, that to his knowledge connection had taken place. Whether there would be issue and whether such issue would be viable are still disputed points: the produce would add another difficulty to the pseudo-science called psychology, as such mule would have only half a soul and issue by a congener would have a quarter-soul. A traveller well known to me once proposed to breed pithecoid men who might be useful as hewers of wood and drawers of water: his idea was to put the highest races of apes to the lowest of humanity.

H. Damant (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 357⁠–⁠360 of the “Indian Antiquary” of 1873) relates the “Tale of the Touchstone,” a legend of Dinahpur, wherein a woman “sells” her four admirers. In the Persian Tales ascribed to the Dervish “Mokles” (Mukhlis) of Isfahan, the lady Aruyá tricks and exposes a Kazi, a doctor and a governor. Boccaccio (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 1) has the story of a lady who shut up her gallant in a chest with her husband’s sanction; and a similar tale (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 1) of Rinuccio and Alexander with the corpse of Scannadeo (Throkh-god). Hence a Lydgate (circ. <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1430) derived the plot of his metrical tale of the “Lady Prioress and her Three Sisters”; which was modified in the Netherlandish version by the introduction of the Long Wapper, a Flemish Robin Goodfellow.

					<p>Arab. “Laylat al-Kadr” = Night of Power or of Divine Decrees. It is “better than a thousand months” (Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XCVII</span> 3), but unhappily the exact time is not known although all agree that it is one of the last ten in Ramazan. The latter when named by Kiláb ibn Murrah, ancestor of Mohammed, about two centuries before Al-Islam, corresponded with July-August and took its name from “Ramzá” or intense heat. But the Prophet, in the tenth Hijrah year, most unwisely forbade “Nasy” = triennial intercalation (Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 36) and thus the lunar month went round all the seasons. On the Night of Power the Koran was sent down from the Preserved Tablet by Allah’s throne, to the first or lunar Heaven whence Gabriel brought it for opportunest revelation to the Apostle (Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XCVII</span>). Also during this night all Divine Decrees for the ensuing year are taken from the Tablet and are given to the angels for execution whilst, the gates of Heaven being open, prayer (as in the text) is sure of success.

The exact time is known only to Prophets; but the pious sit through the Night of Ramazan 27th (our 26th) praying and burning incense-pastilles. In Stambul this is officially held to be the Night of Power. So in mediæval Europe on Christmas Eve the cattle worshipped God in their stalls and I have met peasants in France and Italy who firmly believed that brute beasts on that night not only speak but predict the events of the coming year. <a href="chapter-6-3.xhtml#noteref-2868" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The Badawi have curious prejudices about it: it is a disgrace to sell it (though not to exchange it), and “Labbán,” or “milk-vendor,” is an insult.

The Moslem acknowledges a favour by blessing the donor and by wishing him increase of prosperity. “May thy shadow never be less!” means, Mayest thou always extend to me thy shelter and protection. I have noticed this before but it merits repetition. Strangers, and especially Englishmen, are very positive and very much mistaken upon a point, which all who have to do with Egyptians and Arabs ought thoroughly to understand.

The last Arkam fell before an army sent by Moses to purge the Holy Land (Al-Hijaz) of idolatry. Commentators on the Koran (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>) call the Pharaoh of Moses Al-Walíd and derive him from the Amalekites: we have lately ascertained that this Mene-Ptah was of the Shepherd-Kings and thus, according to the older Moslems, the Hyksos were of the seed of Imlik. (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 116; and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 190.) In Syria they fought with Joshua son of Nun. The tribe or rather nationality was famous and powerful: we know little about it and I may safely predict that when the Amalekite country shall have been well explored, it will produce monuments second in importance only to the Hittites. “A nomadic tribe which occupied the Peninsula of Sinai” (Smith’s Dict. of the Bible) is peculiarly superficial, even for that most superficial of books. <a href="chapter-6-5.xhtml#noteref-2977" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Relations between Badawi tribes are of three kinds; (1) Asháb, allies offensive and defensive, friends who intermarry; (2) Kímán (plur. of Kaum) when the blood-feud exists, and (3) Akhwán = brothers. The last is a complicated affair; “Akháwat” or brotherhood, denotes the tie between patron and client (a noble and an ignoble tribe) or between the stranger and the tribe which claims an immemorial and unalienable right to its own lands. Hence a small fee (Al-Rifkah) must be paid and the traveller and his beast become “dakhíl,” or entitled to brother-help.

					<p>The articles are now of two kinds mostly of baudruche (sheep’s gut) and a few of caoutchouc. They are made almost exclusively in the <span xml:lang="fr">faubourgs</span> of Paris, giving employment to many women and young girls; Grenelle turns out the baudruche and Grenelle and Lilas the India-rubber article; and of the three or four makers M.

The sheep’s gut is not joined in any way but of single piece as it comes from the animal after, of course, much manipulation to make it thin and supple; the inferior qualities are stuck together at the sides. Prices vary from 4½ to 36 francs per gross. Those of India-rubber are always joined at the side with a solution especially prepared for the purpose. I have also heard of fish-bladders but can give no details on the subject.

The systematic depreciation was begun by the late <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Thackeray, perhaps the last man to value the noble independence of Byron’s spirit; and it has been perpetuated, I regret to see, by better judges. These critics seem wholly to ignore the fact that Byron founded a school which covered Europe from Russia to Spain, from Norway to Sicily, and which from England passed over to the two Americas. This exceptional success, which has not yet fallen even to Shakespeare’s lot, was due to genius only, for the poet almost ignored study and poetic art.

Purposeful perversions of Holy Writ are very popular amongst Moslems and form part of their rhetoric; but such is not the case here. According to Von Hammer (Trébutien <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 154), “Eastern geographers place the Bir al-Muʼutallal (Ruined Well) and the Kasr al-Mashíd (High-builded Castle) in the province of Hadramaut, and we wait for a new Niebuhr to inform us what are the monuments or the ruins so called.” His text translates <span xml:lang="fr">puits arides et palais de plâtre</span> (not likely!). Lane remarks that Mashíd mostly means “plastered,” but here = Mushayyad, lofty, explained in the Jalálayn Commentary as = rafíʼa, high-raised.

					<p>Here again are the “Swan-maidens” (See <a href="chapter-5-74.xhtml#night-509">Night <span epub:type="z3998:roman">DIX</span></a>) “one of the primitive myths, the common heritage of the whole Aryan (Iranian) race.” In Persia Bahram-i-Gúr when carried off by the Dív Sapíd seizes the Peri’s dove-coat: in Santháli folk-lore Torica, the Goatherd, steals the garment doffed by one of the daughters of the sun; and hence the twelve birds of Russian Story. To the same cycle belong the Seal-tales of the Faroe Islands (Thorpe’s Northern Mythology) and the wise women or mermaids of Shetland (Hibbert). Wayland the smith captures a wife by seizing a mermaid’s raiment and so did Sir Hagán by annexing the wardrobe of a Danubian water-nymph. Lettsom, the translator, mixes up this swan-raiment with that of the Valkyries or Choosers of the Slain. In real life stealing women’s clothes is an old trick and has often induced them, after having been seen naked, to offer their persons spontaneously. Of this I knew two cases in India, where the theft is justified by divine example. The blue god Krishna, a barbarous and grotesque Hindu Apollo, robbed the raiment of the pretty Gopálís (cowherdesses) who were bathing in the Arjun River and carried them to the top of a Kunduna tree; nor would he restore them till he had reviewed the naked girls and taken one of them to wife. See also Imr al-Kays (of the Muʼallakah) with “Onaiza” at the port of Daratjuljul (Clouston’s Arabian Poetry, <abbr>p.</abbr> 4). A critic has complained of my tracing the origin of the Swan-maiden legend to the physical resemblance between the bird and a high-bred girl (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> <a href="chapter-5-74.xhtml#night-509-1">here</a>). I should have explained my theory which is shortly, that we must seek a material basis for all so-called supernaturalisms, and that anthropomorphism satisfactorily explains the Swan-maiden, as it does the angel and the devil.

					<p>Afterwards called Wák Wák, and in the <abbr>Bresl.</abbr> <abbr>Edit.</abbr> Wák al-Wák. See Lane’s notes upon these Islands. Arab Geographers evidently speak of two Wak Waks. Ibn al-Fakih and Al-Mas’údi (<abbr>Fr.</abbr> Transl., <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 6⁠–⁠7) locate one of them in East Africa beyond Zanzibar and Sofala. “<span xml:lang="fr">Le territoire des Zendjes</span> (Zanzibar-Negroids) <span xml:lang="fr">commence au canal</span> (Al-Khalij) <span xml:lang="fr">dérivé du haut Nil</span> (the Juln River?) <span xml:lang="fr">et se prolonge jusqu’au pays de Sofalah et des Wak-Wak</span>.” It is simply the peninsula of Guardafui (Jard Hafun.) occupied by the Gallas, pagans and Christians, before these were ousted by the Moslem Somal; and the former perpetually ejaculated “Wak” (God) as Moslems cry upon Allah. This identification explains a host of other myths such as the Amazons, who as Marco Polo tells us held the “Female Island” Socotra (Yule <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 396). The fruit which resembled a woman’s head (whence the puellæ Wakwakienses hanging by the hair from trees), and which when ripe called out “Wak Wak” and “Allah al-Khallák” (the Creator) refers to the Calabash-tree (<em>Adausonia digitata</em>), that grotesque growth, a vegetable elephant, whose gourds, something larger than a man’s head, hang by a slender filament. Similarly the “cocoa” got its name, in Port. = Goblin, from the fancied face at one end. The other Wak Wak has been identified in turns with the Seychelles, Madagascar, Malacca, Sunda or Java (this by Langlès), China and Japan. The learned <abbr>Prof.</abbr> de Goeje (Arabishe Berichten over Japan, Amsterdam Muller, 1880) informs us that in Canton the name of Japan is Wo-Kwok, possibly a corruption of Koku-tan, the ebony-tree (<em>Diospyros ebenum</em>) which Ibn Khordábah and others find together with gold in an island 4,500 parasangs from Suez and East of China. And we must remember that Basrah was the chief starting-place for the Celestial Empire during the rule of the Tang dynasty (seventh and ninth centuries). Colonel J. W. Watson of Bombay suggests New Guinea or the adjacent islands where the Bird of Paradise is said to cry “Wak Wak!” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> W. F. Kirby in the Preface (<abbr>p.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>) to his neat little book “The New Arabian Nights,” says: “The Islands of Wak-Wak, seven years’ journey from Bagdad, in the story of Hasan, have receded to a distance of a hundred and fifty years’ journey in that of Majin (of Khorasan). There is no doubt (?) that the Cora Islands, near New Guinea, are intended; for the wonderful fruits which grow there are Birds of Paradise, which settle in flocks on the trees at sunset and sunrise, uttering this very cry.” Thus, like Ophir, Wak Wak has wandered all over the world and has been found even in Peru by the Turkish work Tárikh al-Hind al-Gharbi = History of the West Indies (Orient.

But after the girl-mother’s first child (in Europe <i xml:lang="fr">le premier embellit</i>) all changes. Nature and bodily power have been overtasked; then comes the long suckling at the mother’s expense: the extension of the skin and the enlargement of its vessels are too sudden and rapid for the diminished ability of contraction and the bad food aids in the continual consumption of vitality. Hence, among Eastern women age and ugliness are synonymous.

					<p>Amongst Moslems bastardy is a sore offence and a love-child is exceedingly rare. The girl is not only carefully guarded but she also guards herself knowing that otherwise she will not find a husband. Hence seduction is all but unknown. The wife is equally well guarded and lacks opportunities hence adultery is found difficult except in books. Of the Ibn (or Walad) Harám (bastard as opposed to the Ibn Halál) the proverb says, “This child is not thine, so the madder he be the more is thy glee!” Yet strange to say public prostitution has never been wholly abolished in Al-Islam. Al-Mas’údi tell us that in Arabia were public prostitutes (Bagháyá), even before the days of the Apostle, who affected certain quarters as in our day the Tartúshah of Alexandria and the Hosh Bardak of Cairo. Here says Herr Carlo Landberg (<abbr>p.</abbr> 57, Syrian Proverbs) “<span xml:lang="fr">Elles parlent une langue toute à elle.</span>” So pretentious and dogmatic a writer as the author of <span xml:lang="fr">Proverbes et Dictons de la Province de Syrie</span>, ought surely to have known that the Hosh Bardak is the head-quarters of the Cairene Gypsies.

					<p>Our Aden which is thus noticed by Abulfeda (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1331): “Aden in the lowlands of Tehámah * * * also called Abyana from a man (who found it?), built upon the sea-shore, a station (for land travellers) and a sailing-place for merchant ships India-bound, is dry and sunparcht (Kashifah, squalid, scorbutic) and sweet water must be imported. * * * It lies 86 parasangs from San’á but Ibn Haukal following the travellers makes it three stages. The city, built on the skirt of a wall-like mountain, has a water-gate and a land-gate known as Bab al-Sákayn. But ʼAdan Láʼah (the modest, the timid, the less known as opposed to Abyan, the better known?) is a city in the mountains of Sabir, Al-Yaman, whence issued the supporters of the Fatimite Caliphs of Egypt.” ʼAdan etymologically means in Arab. and Heb. pleasure (<i xml:lang="el">ἥδονη</i>), Eden (the garden), the Heaven in which spirits will see Allah and our “Coal-hole of the East,” which we can hardly believe ever to have been an Eden. <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Badger who supplied me with this note described the two Adens in a paper in Ocean Highways, which he cannot now find.

					<p>Arab. “Zahrawíyah” which contains a kind of double entendre. Fátimah the Prophet’s only daughter is titled Al-Zahrá the “bright-blooming”; and this is also an epithet of Zohrah the planet Venus. For Fatimah see <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> <a href="chapter-6-3.xhtml#chapter-6-3-10">here</a>. Of her Mohammed said, “Love your daughters, for I too am a father of daughters” and, “Love them, they are the comforters, the dearlings.” The Lady appears in Moslem history a dreary young woman (died æt. 28) who made this world, like Honorius, a hell in order to win a next-world heaven. Her titles are Zahrá and Batúl (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 90) both signifying virgin. Burckhardt translates Zahrá by “bright blooming” (the etymological sense); it denotes literally a girl who has not menstruated, in which state of purity the Prophet’s daughter is said to have lived and died. “Batúl” has the sense of a “clean maid” and is the title given by Eastern Christians to the Virgin Mary. The perpetual virginity of Fatimah even after motherhood (Hasan and Husayn) is a point of orthodoxy in Al-Islam as Juno’s with the Romans and Umá’s with the Hindu worshippers of Shiva. During her life Mohammed would not allow Ali a second wife, and he held her one of the four perfects, the other three being Asia wife of “Pharaoh,” the Virgin Mary and Khadíjah his own wife. She caused much scandal after his death by declaring that he had left her the Fadak estate (Abulfeda <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, 133, 273) a castle with a fine palm-orchard near Khaybar. Abu Bakr dismissed the claim quoting the Apostle’s Hadis. “We prophets are folk who will away nothing: what we leave is alms gift to the poor,” and Shiʼahs greatly resent his decision. (See Dabistan <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 51⁠–⁠52 for a different rendering of the words). I have given the popular version of the Lady Fatimah’s death and burial (Pilgrimage <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 315) and have remarked that Moslem historians delight in the obscurity which hangs over her last resting-place, as if it were an honour even for the receptacle of her ashes to be concealed from the eyes of men.

In England it is the reverse; the obtuse sensitiveness of a people bred on beef and beer has made the “Religion of the Nineteenth Century” a manner of harmless magic, whose miracles are table-turning and ghost seeing whilst the prodigious rascality of its prophets (the so-called Mediums) has brought it into universal disrepute. It has been said that Catholicism must be true to co-exist with the priest and it is the same with Spiritualism proper, by which I understand the belief in a life beyond the grave, a mere continuation of this life; it flourishes (despite the Medium) chiefly because it has laid before man the only possible and intelligible idea of a future state. <a href="chapter-9-4.xhtml#noteref-4174" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>To spit or blow the nose in good society is “vulgar.” Sneezing (Al-ʼAtsah) is a complicated affair. For Talmudic traditions of death by sneezing see Lane (M.

Amongst Hindus sneezing and yawning are caused by evil spirits whom they drive away by snapping thumb and forefinger as loudly as possible. The pagan Arabs held sneezing a bad omen, which often stopped their journeys. Moslems believe that when Allah placed the Soul (life?) in Adam, the dry clay became flesh and bone and the First Man, waking to life, sneezed and ejaculated “Alhamdolillah;” whereto Gabriel replied, “Allah have mercy upon thee, O Adam!” Mohammed, who liked sneezing because accompanied by lightness of body and openness of pores, said of it, “If a man sneeze or eructate and say ‘Alhamdolillah’ he averts seventy diseases of which the least is leprosy” (Juzám); also, “If one of you sneeze, let him exclaim, ‘Alhamdolillah,’ and let those around salute him in return with, ‘Allah have mercy upon thee!’ and lastly let him say, ‘Allah direct you and strengthen your condition.’ ” Moderns prefer, “Allah avert what may joy thy foe!” = (our God bless you!) to which the answer is “Alhamdolillah!” Mohammed disliked yawning (Suabá or Thuabá), because not beneficial as a sneeze and said, “If one of you gape and cover not his mouth, a devil leaps into it.” This is still a popular superstition from Baghdad to Morocco. <a href="chapter-9-8.xhtml#noteref-4359" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Lane rejects this tale because it is “extremely objectionable; far more so than the title might lead me to expect.” But he quotes the following marginal note by his Shaykh:⁠—“Many persons (women) reckon marrying a second time amongst the most disgraceful of actions. This opinion is commonest in the country-towns and villages; and my mother’s relations are thus distinguished; so that a woman of them, when her husband dieth or divorceth her while she is young, passeth in widowhood her life, however long it may be, and disdaineth to marry a second time.” I fear that this state of things belongs to the good old days now utterly gone by; and the loose rule of the stranger, especially the English, in Egypt will renew the scenes which characterised Sind when Sir Charles Napier hanged every husband who cut down an adulterous wife. I have elsewhere noticed the ignorant idea that Moslems deny to women souls and seats in Paradise, whilst Mohammed canonised two women in his own family. The theory arose with the “Fathers” of the Christian Church who simply exaggerated the misogyny of <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul. <abbr>St.</abbr> Ambrose commenting on Corinthians <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, boldly says:⁠—“<span xml:lang="la">Feminas ad imaginem Dei factas non esse.</span>” <abbr>St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas and his school adopted the Aristotelian view, “<span xml:lang="la">Mulier est erratum naturæ, et mas occasionatus, et per accidens generatur; atque idèo est monstrum.</span>” For other instances see Bayle <abbr>s.v.</abbr> Gediacus (Revd. Simon of Brandebourg) who in 1695 published a “<span xml:lang="la">Defensio Sexus muliebris</span>,” a refutation of an anti-Socinian satire or squib, “<span xml:lang="la">Disputatio perjucunda, Mulieres homines non esse</span>,” Parisiis, 1693. But when Islam arose in the seventh century, the Christian learned cleverly affixed the stigma of their own misogyny upon the Moslems <span xml:lang="la">ad captandas fœminas</span> and in Southern Europe the calumny still bears fruit. Mohammed (Koran, <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIV</span>) commands for the first time, in the sixth year of his mission, the veiling and, by inference, the seclusion of women, which was apparently unknown to the Badawin and, if practised in the cities was probably of the laxest. Nor can one but confess that such modified separation of the sexes, which it would be impossible to introduce into European manners, has great and notable advantages. It promotes the freest intercourse between man and man, and thus civilises what we call the “lower orders”: in no Moslem land, from Morocco to China, do we find the brutals without manners or morals which are bred by European and especially by English civilisation. For the same reason it enables women to enjoy fullest intimacy and friendship with one another, and we know that the best of both sexes are those who prefer the society of their own as opposed to “quite the lady’s man” and “quite the gentleman’s woman.” It also adds an important item to social decorum by abolishing <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> such indecencies as the “ballroom <em>flirtation</em>”⁠—a word which must be borrowed from us, not translated by foreigners. And especially it gives to religious meetings, a tone which the presence of women modifies and not for the better. Perhaps, the best form is that semi-seclusion of the sex, which prevailed in the heroic ages of Greece, Rome, and India (before the Moslem invasion), and which is perpetuated in Christian Armenia and in modern Hellas. It is a something between the conventual strictness of Al-Islam and the liberty, or rather licence, of the “Anglo-Saxon” and the “Anglo-American.” And when England shall have cast off that peculiar insularity which makes her differ from all civilised peoples, she will probably abolish three gross abuses, time-honoured scandals, which bear very heavily on women and children. The first is the Briton’s right to will property away from his wife and offspring. The second is the action for “breach of promise,” salving the broken heart with pounds, shillings, and pence: it should be treated simply as an exaggerated breach of contract. The third is the procedure popularly called “Crim. Con.,” and this is the most scandalous of all: the offence is against the rights of property, like robbery or burglary, and it ought to be treated criminally with fine, imprisonment and in cases with corporal punishment after the sensible procedure of Moslem law. <a href="chapter-9-10.xhtml#noteref-4412" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Iblis and his connection with Diabolos has been noticed in <a href="#note-19">note 19</a>.

Others call him Al-Háris (the Lion) hence Eve’s first-born was named in his honour Abd al-Haris. His angelic name was Azázíl before he sinned by refusing to prostrate himself to Adam, as Allah had commanded the heavenly host for a trial of faith, not to worship the first man, but to make him a Keblah or direction of prayer addressed to the Almighty. Hence he was ejected from Heaven and became the arch-enemy of mankind (Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span> 48). He was an angel but related to the Jinn: Al-Bayzáwi, however (on Koran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 82), opines that angelic by nature he became a Jinn by act.

					<p>A popular saying also applied to men. It is usually accompanied with showing the open hand and a reference to the size of the fingers. I find this story most interesting from an anthropological point of view; suggesting how differently various races regard the subject of adultery. In Northern Europe the burden is thrown most unjustly upon the man, the woman who tempts him being a secondary consideration; and in England he is absurdly termed “a seducer.” In former times he was “paraded” or “called out,” now he is called up for damages, a truly ignoble and shopkeeper-like mode of treating a high offence against private property and public morality. In Anglo-America, where English feeling is exaggerated, the lover is revolver’d and the woman is left unpunished. On the other hand, amongst Eastern and especially Moslem peoples, the woman is cut down and scant reckoning is taken from the man. This more sensible procedure has struck firm root amongst the nations of Southern Europe where the husband kills the lover only when he still loves his wife and lover-like is furious at her affection being alienated.</p>
					<p>Practically throughout the civilised world there are only two ways of treating women. Moslems keep them close, defend them from all kinds of temptations and if they go wrong kill them. Christians place them upon a pedestal, the observed of all observers, expose them to every danger and if they fall, accuse and abuse them instead of themselves. And England is so grandly logical that her law, under certain circumstances, holds that <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> A. has committed adultery with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> B. but <abbr>Mr.</abbr> B. has not committed adultery with <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> A. Can any absurdity be more absurd? Only “<span xml:lang="fr">summum jus, summa injuria</span>.” See my Terminal Essay.

					<p>Oriental writers, Indian and Persian, as well as Arab, lay great stress upon the extreme delicacy of the skin of the fair ones celebrated in their works, constantly attributing to their heroines bodies so sensitive as to brook with difficulty the contact of the finest shift. Several instances of this will be found in the present collection and we may fairly assume that the skin of an Eastern beauty, under the influence of constant seclusion and the unremitting use of cosmetics and the bath, would in time attain a pitch of delicacy and sensitiveness such as would in some measure justify the seemingly extravagant statements of their poetical admirers, of which the following anecdote (quoted by Ibn Khellikan from the historian Et Teberi) is a fair specimen. Ardeshir ibn Babek (Artaxerxes <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>), the first Sassanian King of Persia (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 226⁠–⁠242), having long unsuccessfully besieged El Hedr, a strong city of Mesopotamia belonging to the petty King Es Satiroun, at last obtained possession of it by the treachery of the owner’s daughter Nezireh and married the latter, this having been the price stipulated by her for the betrayal to him of the place. “It happened afterwards that, one night, as she was unable to sleep and turned from side to side in the bed, Ardeshir asked her what prevented her from sleeping. She replied, ‘I never yet slept on a rougher bed than this; I feel something irk me.’ He ordered the bed to be changed, but she was still unable to sleep. Next morning, she complained of her side, and on examination, a myrtle-leaf was found adhering to a fold of the skin, from which it had drawn blood. Astonished at this circumstance, Ardeshir asked her if it was this that had kept her awake and she replied in the affirmative. ‘How then,’ asked he, ‘did your father bring you up?’ She answered, ‘He spread me a bed of satin and clad me in silk and fed me with marrow and cream and the honey of virgin bees and gave me pure wine to drink.’ Quoth Ardeshir, ‘The same return which you made your father for his kindness would be made much more readily to me’; and bade bind her by the hair to the tail of a horse, which galloped off with her and killed her.” It will be remembered that the true princess, in the well-known German popular tale, is discovered by a similar incident to that of the myrtle-leaf.

He never saw a man put hand to pocket without expecting a present, or a funeral go by without hoping for a legacy, or a bridal procession without preparing his own house, hoping they might bring the bride to him by mistake. * * * When asked if he knew aught greedier than himself he said “Yes; a sheep I once kept upon my terrace-roof seeing a rainbow mistook it for a rope of hay and jumping to seize it broke its neck!” Hence “Ashʼab’s sheep” became a by-word (Preston tells the tale in full, <abbr>p.</abbr> 288). <a href="chapter-10-1.xhtml#noteref-4635" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This threefold distribution occurred to me many years ago and when far beyond reach of literary authorities: I was, therefore, much pleased to find the subjoined threefold classification with minor details made by Baron von Hammer-Purgstall (Preface to Contes Inédits <abbr>etc.</abbr> of G. S. Trébutien, Paris, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">MDCCCXXVIII</span>). (1) The older stories which serve as a base to the collection, such as the Ten Wazirs (“Malice of Women”) and Voyages of Sindbad (?) which may date from the days of Mahommed. These are distributed into two sub-classes; (<em>a</em>) the marvellous and purely imaginative (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> Jamasp and the Serpent Queen) and (<em>b</em>) the realistic mixed with instructive fables and moral instances. (2) The stories and anecdotes peculiarly Arab, relating to the Caliphs and especially to Al-Rashíd; and (3) The tales of Egyptian provenance, which mostly date from the times of the puissant “Aaron the Orthodox.” <abbr>Mr.</abbr> John Payne (Villon Translation, <abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> <abbr>pp.</abbr> 367⁠–⁠73) distributes the stories roughly under five chief heads as follows: (1) Histories or long Romances, as King Omar bin Al-Nuʼman. (2) Anecdotes or short stories dealing with historical personages and with incidents and adventures belonging to the every-day life of the period to which they refer: <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> those concerning Al-Rashíd and Hátim of Tayy. (3) Romances and romantic fictions comprising three different kinds of tales; (<em>a</em>) purely romantic and supernatural; (<em>b</em>) fictions and nouvelles with or without a basis and background of historical fact and (<em>c</em>) <span xml:lang="fr">Contes fantastiques</span>. (4) Fables and Apologues; and (5) Tales proper, as that of Tawaddud. <a href="chapter-10-3.xhtml#noteref-4719" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>A notable instance of Roman superficiality, incuriousness and ignorance.

Æsopus. The first or eldest Lokman, entitled Al-Hakím (the Sage) and the hero of the Koranic chapter which bears his name, was son of Bá’úrá of the Children of Azar, sister’s son to Job or son of Job’s maternal aunt; he witnessed David’s miracles of mail-making and when the tribe of ’Ád was destroyed, he became King of the country. The second, also called the Sage, was a slave, an Abyssinian negro, sold to the Israelites during the reign of David or Solomon, synchronous with the Persian Kay Káús and Kay Khusrau, also Pythagoras the Greek(!). His physique is alluded to in the saying, “Thou resemblest Lokman (in black ugliness) but not in wisdom” (Ibn Khallikan <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 145). This negro or negroid, after a godly and edifying life, left a volume of “Amsál,” proverbs and exempla (not fables or apologues); and Easterns still say, “One should not pretend to teach Lokmán”⁠—in Persian, “Hikmat ba Lokman ámokhtan.” Three of his apothegms dwell in the public memory: “The heart and the tongue are the best and worst parts of the human body.” “I learned wisdom from the blind who make sure of things by touching them” (as did <abbr>St.</abbr> Thomas); and, when he ate the colocynth offered by his owner, “I have received from thee so many a sweet that ’twould be surprising if I refused this one bitter.” He was buried (says the Tárikh Muntakhab) at Ramlah in Judæa, with the seventy Prophets stoned in one day by the Jews. The youngest Lokman “of the vultures” was a prince of the tribe of Ad who lived 3,500 years, the age of seven vultures (Tabari). He could dig a well with his nails; hence the saying, “Stronger than Lokman” (A. P. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 701); and he loved the arrow-game, hence “More gambling than Lokman” (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 938). “More voracious than Lokman” (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 134) alludes to his eating one camel for breakfast and another for supper. His wife Barákish also appears in proverb, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> “Camel us and camel thyself” (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 295) <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> give us camel flesh to eat, said when her son by a former husband brought her a fine joint which she and her husband relished.

					<p>The fox and the jackal are confounded by the Arabic dialects not by the Persian, whose “Rubáh” can never be mistaken for “Shaghál.” “Saʼlab” among the Semites is locally applied to either beast and we can distinguish the two only by the fox being solitary and rapacious, and the jackal gregarious and a carrion-eater. In all Hindu tales the jackal seems to be an awkward substitute for the Grecian and classical fox, the Giddar or Kolá (<em>Canis aureus</em>) being by no means sly and wily as the Lomri (<em>Vulpes vulgaris</em>). This is remarked by Weber (<span xml:lang="de">Indische Studien</span>) and <abbr>Prof.</abbr> Benfey’s retort about “King Nobel” the lion is by no means to the point.

					<p>Boccaccio (ob. <abbr>Dec.</abbr> 2, 1375), may easily have heard of The Thousand Nights and a Night or of its archetype the Hazár Afsánah.

					<p>Translated and well annotated by <abbr>Prof.</abbr> Tawney, who, however, affects asterisks and has considerably bowdlerised sundry of the tales, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> the Monkey who picked out the Wedge (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 28). This tale, by the by, is found in the Khirad Afroz (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 128) and in the Anwar-i-Suhayli (<abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>) and gave rise to the Persian proverb, “What has a monkey to do with carpentering?” It is curious to compare the Hindu with the Arabic work whose resemblances are as remarkable as their differences, while even more notable is their correspondence in impressionising the reader. The Thaumaturgy of both is the same: the Indian is profuse in demonology and witchcraft; in transformation and restoration; in monsters as wind-men, fire-men and water-men; in air-going elephants and flying horses (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 541⁠–⁠43); in the wishing cow, divine goats and laughing fishes (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 24); and in the speciosa miracula of magic weapons. He delights in fearful battles (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 400) fought with the same weapons as the Moslem and rewards his heroes with a “turband of honour” (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 266) in lieu of a robe. There is a quaint family likeness arising from similar stages and states of society: the city is adorned for gladness; men carry money in a robe-corner and exclaim “Ha! good!” (for “Good, by Allah!”); lovers die with exemplary facility; the “soft-sided” ladies drink spirits (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 61) and princesses get drunk (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 476); whilst the Eunuch, the Hetaira and the bawd (Kuttini) play the same preponderating parts as in The Nights. Our Brahman is strong in love-making; he complains of the pains of separation in this phenomenal universe; he revels in youth, “twin-brother to mirth,” and beauty which has illuminating powers; he foully reviles old age and he alternately praises and abuses the sex, concerning which more presently. He delights in truisms, the fashion of contemporary Europe (see Palmerin of England <abbr>chapt.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>), such as “It is the fashion of the heart to receive pleasure from those things which ought to give it,” <abbr>etc.</abbr> <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> What is there the wise cannot understand? and so forth. He is liberal in trite reflections and frigid conceits (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 19, 55, 97, 103, 107, in fact everywhere); and his puns run through whole lines: this in fine Sanskrit style is inevitable. Yet some of his expressions are admirably terse and telling, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> Ascending the swing of Doubt: Bound together (lovers) by the leash of gazing: Two babes looking like Misery and Poverty: Old Age seized me by the chin: (A lake) first assay of the Creator’s skill: (A vow) difficult as standing on a sword-edge: My vital spirits boiled with the fire of woe: Transparent as a good man’s heart: There was a certain convent full of fools: Dazed with scripture-reading: The stones could not help laughing at him: The Moon kissed the laughing forehead of the East: She was like a wave of the Sea of Love’s insolence (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 127), a wave of the Sea of Beauty tossed up by the breeze of Youth: The King played dice, he loved slave-girls, he told lies, he sat up o’ nights, he waxed wroth without reason, he took wealth wrongously, he despised the good and honoured the bad (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 562); with many choice bits of the same kind. Like the Arab the Indian is profuse in personification; but the doctrine of preexistence, of incarnation and emanation and an excessive spiritualism, ever aiming at the infinite, makes his imagery run mad. Thus we have Immoral Conduct embodied; the God of Death; Science; the Svarga-heaven; Evening; Untimeliness; and the Earth-bride, while the Ace and Deuce of dice are turned into a brace of Demons. There is also that grotesqueness which the French detect even in Shakespeare, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> She drank in his ambrosial form with thirsty eyes like partridges (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 476) and it often results from the comparison of incompatibles, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> a row of birds likened to a garden of nymphs; and from forced allegories, the favourite figure of contemporary Europe. Again, the rhetorical Hindu style differs greatly from the sobriety, directness and simplicity of the Arab, whose motto is Brevity combined with precision, except where the latter falls into “fine writing.” And, finally, there is a something in the atmosphere of these Tales which is unfamiliar to the West and which makes them, as more than one has remarked to me, very hard reading. <a href="chapter-10-3.xhtml#noteref-4889" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This author, however, when hazarding a change of style which is, I think, regretable, has shown abundant art by filling up the frequent deficiencies of the text after the fashion of Baron McGuckin de Slane in Ibn Khallikan. As regards the tout ensemble of his work, a noble piece of English, my opinion will ever be that expressed in my Foreword. A carping critic has remarked that the translator, “as may be seen in every page, is no Arabic scholar.” If I be a judge, the reverse is the case: the brilliant and beautiful version thus traduced is almost entirely free from the blemishes and carelessness which disfigure Lane’s, and thus it is far more faithful to the original. But it is no secret that on the staff of that journal the translator of Villon has sundry enemies, <i xml:lang="fr">vrais diables enjupponés</i>, who take every opportunity of girding at him because he does not belong to the clique and because he does good work when theirs is mostly sham. The sole fault I find with <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Payne is that his severe grace of style treats an unclassical work as a classic, when the romantic and irregular would have been a more appropriate garb.

					<p>There is no more immoral work than the “Old Testament.” Its deity is an ancient Hebrew of the worst type, who condones, permits or commands every sin in the Decalogue to a Jewish patriarch, <i xml:lang="la">quâ</i> patriarch.

					<p>By its love symptoms, suggesting that possession is the sole cure for passion, Erasistratus discovered the love of Antiochus for Stratonice. Mure (Hist. of Greek Literature, 1850) speaks of the Ode to Aphrodite (Frag. 1) as “one in which the whole volume of Greek literature offers the most powerful concentration into one brilliant focus of the modes in which amatory concupiscence can display itself.” But Bernhardy, Bode, Richter, K.

					<p>Plato (Symp.) is probably mystical when he accounts for such passions by there being in the beginning three species of humanity, men, women and men-women or androgynes. When the latter were destroyed by Zeus for rebellion, the two others were individually divided into equal parts. Hence each division seeks its other half in the same sex; the primitive man prefers men and the primitive woman women. <span xml:lang="fr">C’est beau</span>, but⁠—is it true? The idea was probably derived from Egypt which supplied the Hebrews with androgynic humanity; and thence it passed to extreme India, where Shiva as Ardhanárí was male on one side and female on the other side of the body, combining paternal and maternal qualities and functions. The first creation of humans (Gen. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 27) was hermaphrodite (= Hermes and Venus) <span xml:lang="la">masculum et fœminam creavit eos</span>⁠—male and female created He them⁠—on the sixth day, with the command to increase and multiply (ibid. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 28) while Eve the woman was created subsequently. Meanwhile, say certain Talmudists, Adam carnally copulated with all races of animals.

The Metáwali heretics, a people of Persian descent and Shiite tenets, and the peasantry of “Bilád B’sharrah,” which I would derive from Bayt Ashirah, still pilgrimage to the ruins and address their vows to the Sayyidat al-Kabírah, the Great Lady. Orthodox Moslems accuse them of abominable orgies and point to the lamps and rags which they suspend to a tree entitled Shajarat al-Sitt⁠—the Lady’s tree⁠—an Acacia Albida which, according to some travellers, is found only here and at Sayda (Sidon) where an avenue exists. The people of Kasrawán, a Christian province in the Libanus, inhabited by a peculiarly prurient race, also hold high festival under the far-famed Cedars and their women sacrifice to Venus like the Kadashah of the Phœnicians.

The next discovery was that two strings of the same substance and tension, the one being double the length of the other, gave the diapason-interval or an eighth; and the same was effected from two strings of similar length and size, the one having four times the tension of the other.
