			<h2 epub:type="title">Al-Malik Al-Nasir and the Three Chiefs of Police</h2>

<p>Once upon a time Al-Malik al-Násir<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2032" id="noteref-2032" epub:type="noteref">2033</a> sent for the Wális or Chiefs
of Police of Cairo, Bulak, and Fostat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2033" id="noteref-2033" epub:type="noteref">2033</a> and said to them, “I desire
each of you to recount me the marvellousest thing that hath
befallen him during his term of office.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Al-Malik
al-Nasir to the three Walis, “I desire each of you to recount
me the marvellousest thing which hath befallen him during his
term of office.” So they answered, “We hear and we obey.”
Then said the Chief of the Police of Cairo, “Know thou, O our
lord the Sultan, the most wonderful thing that befel me, during my
term of office, was on this wise:” and he began</p>

<h3 id="c271b" class="c016"><em>THE STORY OF THE CHIEF OF POLICE OF CAIRO.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">There were in this city two men of good repute fit to bear witness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2034" id="noteref-2034" epub:type="noteref">2034</a><a id="p271"></a>
in matters of murder and wounds; but they were both secretly
addicted to intrigues with low women and to wine-bibbing and to
dissolute doings, nor could I succeed (do what I would) in bringing
them to book; and I began to despair of success. So I charged
the taverners and confectioners and fruiterers and candle-chandlers
and the keepers of brothels and bawdy houses to acquaint me of
these two good men whenever they should anywhere be engaged
in drinking or other debauchery, or together or apart; and ordered
that, if they both or if either of them bought at their shops aught for
the purpose of wassail and carousal, the vendors should not conceal
it from me. And they replied, “We hear and obey.” Presently
it chanced that one night, a man came to me and said, “O my
master, know that the two just men, the two witnesses, are in such
a street in such a house, engaged in abominable wickedness.” So
I disguised myself, I and my body-servant, and ceased not trudging
till I came to the house and knocked at the door, whereupon a
slave-girl came out and opened to me, saying, “Who art thou?” I
entered without answering her and saw the two legal witnesses and
the house-master sitting, and lewd women by their side and before
them great plenty of wine. When they saw me, they rose to
receive me, and made much of me, seating me in the place of
honour and saying to me, “Welcome for an illustrious guest and
well come for a pleasant cup-companion!” And on this wise they
met me without showing a sign of alarm or trouble. Presently,
the master of the house arose from amongst us and went out and
returned after a while with three hundred dinars, when the men
said to me, without the least fear, “Know, O our lord the Wali, it
is in thy power to do even more than disgrace and punish us; but
this will bring thee in return nothing but weariness: so we reck
thou wouldest do better to take this much money and protect us;
for Almighty Allah is named the Protector and loveth those of His
servants who protect their Moslem neighbours; and thou shalt
have thy reward in this world and due recompense in the world to
come.” So I said to myself, “I will take the money and protect
them this once; but, if ever again I have them in my power, I will
take my wreak of them;” for, you see, the money had tempted
me. Thereupon I took it and went away thinking that no one
would know it; but, next day, on a sudden one of the Kazi’s
messengers came to me and said to me, “O Wali, be good enough
to answer the summons of the Kazi who wanteth thee.” So I
arose and accompanied him, knowing not the meaning of all this;
and when I came into the judge’s presence, I saw the two witnesses
and the master of the house, who had given me the money, sitting
by his side. Thereupon this man rose and sued me for three hundred
dinars, nor was it in my power to deny the debt; for he
produced a written obligation and his two companions, the legal
witnesses, testified against me that I owed the amount. Their
evidence satisfied the Kazi and he ordered me to pay the sum; nor
did I leave the Court till they had of me the three hundred gold
pieces. So I went away, in the utmost wrath and shame, vowing
mischief and vengeance against them and repenting that I had not
punished them. Such, then is the most remarkable event which
befel me during my term of office. Thereupon rose the Chief of
the Bulak Police and said, “As for me, O our lord the Sultan, the
most marvellous thing that happened to me, since I became Wali,
was as follows:” and he began</p>

<h3 id="c273" class="c016"><em>THE STORY OF THE CHIEF OF THE BULAK POLICE.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">I was once in debt to the full amount of three hundred thousand
gold pieces;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2035" id="noteref-2035" epub:type="noteref">2035</a> and, being distressed thereby, I sold all that was
behind me and what was before me and all I hent in hand, but I
could collect no more than an hundred thousand dinars——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wali of
Bulak continued:—So I sold all that was behind and before me,
but could collect no more than an hundred thousand dinars and
remained in great perplexity. Now one night, as I sat at home in
this state, behold, there came a knocking; so I said to one of my
servants, “See who is at the door.” He went out and returned,
wan of face, changed in countenance and with his side-muscles
a-quivering; so I asked him, “What aileth thee?”; and he
answered, “There is a man at the door; he is half naked, clad in
skins, with sword in hand and knife in girdle, and with him are a
company of the same fashion and he asketh for thee.” So I took my
sword and going out to see who these were, behold, I found them
as the boy had reported and said to them, “What is your business?”
They replied, “Of a truth we be thieves and have done
fine work this night; so we appointed the swag to thy use, that thou
mayst pay therewith the debts which sadden thee and deliver thee
from thy distress.” Quoth I, “Where is the plunder?”; and they
brought me a great chest, full of vessels of gold and silver; which
when I saw, I rejoiced and said to myself, “Herewith I will settle
all claims upon me and there will remain as much again.” So I
took the money and going inside said in my mind, “It were ignoble
to let them fare away empty-handed.” Whereupon I brought out
the hundred thousand dinars I had by me and gave it to them,
thanking them for their kindness; and they pouched the monies
and went their way, under cover of the night so that none might
know of them. But when morning dawned I examined the contents
of the chest, and found them copper and tin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2036" id="noteref-2036" epub:type="noteref">2036</a> washed with
gold worth five hundred dirhams at the most; and this was
grievous to me, for I had lost what monies I had and trouble
was added to my trouble. Such, then, is the most remarkable
event which befel me during my term of office. Then rose the
Chief of the Police of Old Cairo and said, “O our lord the Sultan,
the most marvellous thing that happened to me, since I became
Wali, was on this wise;” and he began</p>

<h3 id="c274" class="c016"><em>THE STORY OF THE CHIEF OF THE OLD CAIRO POLICE.</em></h3>

<p class="c017">I once hanged ten thieves each on his own gibbet, and especially
charged the guards to watch them and hinder the folk from taking
any one of them down. Next morning when I came to look at
them, I found two bodies hanging from one gallows and said to the
guards, “Who did this, and where is the tenth gibbet?” But they
denied all knowledge of it, and I was about to beat them till they
owned the truth, when they said, “Know, O Emir, that we fell
asleep last night, and when we awoke, we found that some one had
stolen one of the bodies, gibbet and all; so we were alarmed and
feared thy wrath. But, behold, up came a peasant-fellow driving
his ass; whereupon we laid hands on him and killed him and
hanged his body upon this gallows, in the stead of the thief who
had been stolen.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2037" id="noteref-2037" epub:type="noteref">2037</a> Now when I heard this, I marvelled and asked
them, “What had he with him?”; and they answered, “He had a
pair of saddle-bags on the ass.” Quoth I, “What was in them?”;
quoth they, “We know not.” So I said, “Bring them hither;”
and when they brought them to me I bade open them, behold,
therein was the body of a murdered man, cut in pieces. Now as
soon as I saw this, I marvelled at the case and said in myself,
“Glory to God! The cause of the hanging of this peasant was
none other but his crime against this murdered man; and thy
Lord is not unjust towards His servants.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2038" id="noteref-2038" epub:type="noteref">2038</a> And men also tell
