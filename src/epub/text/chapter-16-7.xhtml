<p>They relate (but Allah is All-knowing of His unknown and All-cognisant
of what forewent in the annals of folk and the wonders
of yore, and of times long gone before!) that in the city of Shám<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8056" id="noteref-8056" epub:type="noteref">8056</a>
there dwelt of old a man Attáf hight, who rivalled Hátim of Tayy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8057" id="noteref-8057" epub:type="noteref">8057</a>
in his generosity and his guest-love and in his self-control as to
manners and morals. Now he lived in the years when the Caliph
Harun al-Rashid was reigning in Baghdad-city, and it happened
on a day of the days that this Commander of the Faithful awoke
morne and melancholic, and right straitened was his breast. So
he arose, and taking Ja’afar the Barmecide and Masrúr the Eunuch
passed with them into the place where his treasures were stored.
Presently quoth he to the Wazir, “O Ja’afar, open to me this
door that I may solace me with the sight, and my breast may
be broadened and haply be gladdened by such spectacle.” The
Minister did the bidding of his lord, who, finding a room full of
books, put forth his hand, and taking up one of the volumes,
opened and read. Then he fell to weeping thrice, and thrice to
laughing aloud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8058" id="noteref-8058" epub:type="noteref">8058</a> whereat the Wazir considered him and cried, “O
King of the Age, how is it I espy thee reading and weeping and
laughing at one and the same moment when none so act save
madmen and maniacs?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8059" id="noteref-8059" epub:type="noteref">8059</a> And having spoken on this wise he held
his peace; but the Prince of True Believers turned himwards and
cried, “O dog of the sons of Bermak, I see thee going beyond
thy degree and quitting the company of sensible men, and thou
speakest vainly making me a madman in saying:—None laugh and
cry at one and the same time save maniacs?” With these words
the Caliph restored the volume to its place in the Treasury and
bade lock the door, after which the three returned to the Divan.
Here the Commander of the Faithful regarded Ja’afar and
exclaimed, “Go thou forth from before me and address me not
again nor seat thee upon the Wazirial seat until thou answer
thine own question and thou return me a reply concerning that
which is writ and aligned in yonder book I was reading, to the end
thou learn why I wept and wherefore I laught at one and the same
hour.” And he cried at him in anger saying, “Off and away with
thee, nor face me again save with the answer, else will I slay thee
with the foulest of slaughter.” Accordingly Ja’afar fared forth and
hardly could he see with his eyes, and he kept saying to himself,
“Indeed I have fallen with a sore fall; foul befal it for a fall; how
fulsome it is!” Then he fared homewards where he encountered
face to face his father Yahyá the Bermaki, who was issuing from the
mansion and he recounted to him the tale, whereat his parent said,
“Go at once, abide not here, but turn thee Damascus-wards until shall
terminate this decline of fortune and this disjunction of favour, and
at the ending thereof thou shalt see wonders therein.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8060" id="noteref-8060" epub:type="noteref">8060</a> Ja’afar
replied, “Not until I shall have laid a charge upon my Harím;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8061" id="noteref-8061" epub:type="noteref">8061</a> but
Yahya cried, “Enter not these doors, hie thee at once to Al-Shám, for
even so ’tis determined by Destiny.” Accordingly the Wazir gave
ear to his sire, and taking a bag containing one thousand dinars
and slinging on his sword farewelled him; then, mounting a
she-mule, alone and unattended by slave or page, he rode off and
he ceased not riding for ten days full-told until he arrived at the
Marj<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8062" id="noteref-8062" epub:type="noteref">8062</a> or mead of Damascus. Now it so fortuned that on that
same day Attaf,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8063" id="noteref-8063" epub:type="noteref">8063</a> a fair youth and a well-known of the “Smile of
the Prophet,” and one of the noblest and most generous of her
sons had pitched tents and had spread a banquet outside the city,
where chancing to sight Ja’afar mounted on his beast, he knew him
to be a wayfarer passing by, and said to his slaves, “Call to me
yonder man!” They did his bidding and the stranger rode up to
the party of friends, and dismounting from his mule saluted them
with the salam which they all returned. Then they sat for a while<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8064" id="noteref-8064" epub:type="noteref">8064</a>
after which Attaf arose and led Ja’afar to his house companied by
all the company which was there and they paced into a spacious
open hall and seated themselves in converse for an hour full-told.
Anon the slaves brought them a table spread with the evening
meal and bearing more than ten several manners of meat. So
they ate and were cheered, and after the guests had washed hands,
the eunuchs and attendants brought in candles of honey-coloured
wax that shed a brilliant light, and presently the musicians came
in band and performed a right royal partition while the servants
served up conserves for dessert. So they ate, and when they had
eaten their sufficiency they<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8065" id="noteref-8065" epub:type="noteref">8065</a> drank coffee; and finally, at their
ease and in their own good time, all the guests arose and made
obeisance and fared homewards. Then Attaf and Ja’afar sat at
table for an hour or so, during which the host offered his guest an
hundred greetings, saying, “All kinds of blessings have descended
from Heaven upon our heads. Tell me, how was it thou honouredst
us, and what was the cause of thy coming and of thy favouring us
with thy footsteps?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8066" id="noteref-8066" epub:type="noteref">8066</a> So Ja’afar disclosed to him his name and
office<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8067" id="noteref-8067" epub:type="noteref">8067</a> and told him the reasons of his ride to Damascus from
the beginning to the end full and detailed, whereto Attaf rejoined,
“Tarry with me an thou please a decade of years; and grieve not
at all, for thy Worship is owner of this place.” After this the
eunuchs came in and spread for Ja’afar bedding delicately wrought
at the head of the hall and its honour-stead, and disposed other
sleeping-gear alongside thereof, which seeing the Wazir said to himself,
“Haply my host is a bachelor, that they would spread his bed
by my side; however, I will venture the question.” Accordingly he
addressed his host saying, “O Attaf, art thou single or married?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8068" id="noteref-8068" epub:type="noteref">8068</a>
“I am married, O my lord,” quoth the other, whereat Ja’afar
resumed, “Wherefore dost thou not go within and lie with thy
Harím?” “O my lord,” replied Attaf, “the Harim is not about to
take flight, and it would be naught but disgraceful to me were I
to leave a visitor like thyself, a man by all revered, to sleep alone
while I fare to-night with my Harim and rise betimes to enter the
Hammam.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8069" id="noteref-8069" epub:type="noteref">8069</a> In me such action would I deem be want of courtesy
and failure in honouring a magnifico like thine Honour. In very
sooth, O my lord, so long as thy presence deign favour this house
I will not sleep within my Harem until I farewell thy Worship and
thou depart in peace and safety to thine own place.” “This be a
marvellous matter,” quoth Ja’afar to himself, “and peradventure
he so doeth the more to make much of me.” So they lay
together that night and when morning morrowed they arose and
fared to the Baths whither Attaf had sent for the use of his
guest a suit of magnificent clothes, and caused Ja’afar don it
before leaving the Hammam. Then finding the horses at the
door, they mounted and repaired to the Lady’s Tomb,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8070" id="noteref-8070" epub:type="noteref">8070</a> and spent
a day worthy to be numbered in men’s lives. Nor did they
cease visiting place after place by day and sleeping in the same
stead by night, in the way we have described, for the space of
four months, after which time the soul of the Wazir Ja’afar waxed
sad and sorry, and one chance day of the days, he sat him down
and wept. Seeing him in tears Attaf asked him, saying, “Allah
fend from thee all affliction, O my lord! why dost thou weep and
wherefore art thou grieved? An thou be heavy of heart why not
relate to me what hath oppressed thee?” Answered Ja’afar,
“O my brother, I find my breast sore straitened and I would
fain stroll about the streets of Damascus and solace me with
seeing the Cathedral-mosque of the Ommiades.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8071" id="noteref-8071" epub:type="noteref">8071</a> “And who, O
my lord,” responded the other, “would hinder thee therefrom?
Do thou deign wander whither thou wilt and take thy solace, so
may thy spirits be gladdened and thy breast be broadened.
Herein is none to let or stay thee at all, at all.” Hearing these
words Ja’afar arose to fare forth, when quoth his host, “O my
lord, shall they saddle thee a hackney?” but the other replied,
“O my friend, I would not be mounted for that the man on horseback
may not divert himself by seeing the folk; nay the folk
enjoy themselves by looking upon him.” Quoth Attaf, “At
least delay thee a while that I may supply thee with spending
money to bestow upon the folk; and then fare forth and walk
about to thy content and solace thyself with seeing whatso thou
wilt; so mayest thou be satisfied and no more be sorrowed.”
Accordingly, Ja’afar took from Attaf a purse of three hundred
dinars and left the house gladly as one who issueth from durance
vile, and he turned into the city and began a-wandering about the
streets of Damascus and enjoying the spectacle; and at last he
entered the Jámi’ al-Amawi where he prayed the usual prayers.
After this he resumed his strolling about pleasant places until he
came to a narrow street and found a bench formed of stone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8072" id="noteref-8072" epub:type="noteref">8072</a> set
in the ground. Hereon he took seat to rest a while, and he
looked about, when behold, fronting him were latticed windows
wherein stood cases planted with sweet-smelling herbs.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8073" id="noteref-8073" epub:type="noteref">8073</a> And
hardly had he looked before those casements were opened and
suddenly appeared thereat a young lady,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8074" id="noteref-8074" epub:type="noteref">8074</a> a model of comeliness
and loveliness and fair figure and symmetrical grace, whose
charms would amate all who upon her gaze, and she began
watering her plants. Ja’afar cast upon her a single glance and
was sore hurt by her beauty and brilliancy; but she, after looking
upon the lattices and watering the herbs to the extent they
required turned her round and gazed adown the street where she
caught a sight of Ja’afar sitting and earnestly eyeing her. So she
barred the windows and disappeared. But the Minister lingered
on the bench hoping and expecting that haply the casement would
open a second time and allow him another look at her; and as
often as he would have risen up his nature said to him, “Sit thee
down.” And he stinted not so doing till evening came on, when
he arose and returned to the house of Attaf, whom he found
standing at the gateway to await him, and presently his host exclaimed,
“’Tis well, O my lord! during all this delay indeed my
thoughts have gone with thee for that I have long been expecting
thy return.” “’Tis such a while since I walked abroad,” answered
Ja’afar, “that I had needs look about me and console my soul,
wherefor I lingered and loitered.” Then they entered the house
and sat down, when the eunuchs served up on trays the evening
meal, and the Minister drew near to eat thereof but was wholly
unable, so he cast from his hand the spoon and arose. Hereat
quoth his host, “Why, O my lord, canst thou not eat?” “Because
this day’s noon-meal hath been heavy to me and hindereth
my supping; but ’tis no matter!” quoth the other. And when
the hour for sleep came Ja’afar retired to rest; but in his excitement
by the beauty of that young lady he could not close eye, for
her charms had mastered the greater part of his sense and had
snared his senses as much as might be; nor could he do aught
save groan and cry, “Ah miserable me! who shall enjoy thy
presence, O full Moon of the Age and who shall look upon that
comeliness and loveliness?” And he ceased not being feverish
and to twist and turn upon his couch until late morning, and he
was as one lost<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8075" id="noteref-8075" epub:type="noteref">8075</a> with love; but as soon as it was the undurn-hour
Attaf came in to him and said, “How is thy health? My
thoughts have been settled on thee: and I see that thy slumber
hath lasted until between dawn and midday: indeed I deem that
thou hast lain awake o’night and hast not slept until so near
the mid-forenoon.” “O my brother, I have no Kayf,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8076" id="noteref-8076" epub:type="noteref">8076</a> replied
Ja’afar. So the host forthwith sent a white slave to summon a
physician, and the man did his bidding, and after a short delay
brought one who was the preventer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8077" id="noteref-8077" epub:type="noteref">8077</a> of his day. And when
ushered into Ja’afar’s room he addressed the sick man, “There
is no harm to thee and boon of health befal thee:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8078" id="noteref-8078" epub:type="noteref">8078</a> say me what
aileth thee?” “All is excitement<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8079" id="noteref-8079" epub:type="noteref">8079</a> with me,” answered the other,
whereat the Leach putting forth his fingers felt the wrist of his
patient, when he found the pulsations pulsing strong and the
intermissions intermitting regularly.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8080" id="noteref-8080" epub:type="noteref">8080</a> Noting this he was ashamed
to declare before his face, “Thou art in love!” so he kept
silence and presently said to Attaf, “I will write thee a recipe
containing all that is required by the case.” “Write!” said the
host, and the Physician sat down to indite his prescription, when
behold, a white slave came in and said to his lord, “Thy Harim
requireth thee.” So the host arose and retired to learn what was
wanted of him in the women’s apartments, and when his wife
saw him she asked, “O my lord, what is thy pleasure that we
cook for dinner and supper?” “Whatsoever may be wanted,”
he rejoined and went his ways, for since Ja’afar had been guested
in his house Attaf had not once entered the inner rooms according
as he had before declared to the Minister. Now the Physician
during the host’s visit to the Harem had written out the prescription
and had placed it under the pillow of the patient, and as he
was leaving the house he came suddenly upon the housemaster on
return to the men’s apartment, and Attaf asked him, “Hast thou
written thy prescription?” “Yes,” answered the Leach, “I
have written it and set it under his head.” Thereupon the host
pulled out a piastre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8081" id="noteref-8081" epub:type="noteref">8081</a> and therewith fee’d the physician; after
which he went up to Ja’afar’s couch and drew the paper from
under his pillow and read it and saw therein written,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8082" id="noteref-8082" epub:type="noteref">8082</a> “O Attaf,
verily thy guest is a lover, so do thou look for her he loveth and
for his state purvey and make not overmuch delay.” So the host
addressed his guest, saying, “Thou art now become one of us:
why then hide from me thy case and conceal from me thy condition?
This Doctor, than whom is none keener or cleverer in
Damascus, hath learned all that befel thee.” Hereupon he produced
the paper and showed it to Ja’afar, who took it and read it
with a smile; then he cried, “This Physician is a master leach
and his saying is soothfast. Know that on the day when I went
forth from thee and sauntered about the streets and lanes, there
befel me a matter which I never had thought to have betided me;
no, never; and I know not what shall become of me for that, O
my brother Attaf, my case is one involving life-loss.” And he
told him all that had happened to himself; how when seated upon
the bench a lattice had been unclosed afront of him and he had
seen a young lady, the loveliest of her time, who had thrown it
open and had come forward to water her window-garden; adding,
“Now my heart was upstirred by love to her, and she had suddenly
withdrawn after looking down the street and closed the casement
as soon as she had seen a stranger gazing upon her. Again and
again I was minded to rise and retire but desire for her kept me
seated in the hope that haply she would again throw open the
lattice and allow me the favour of another glimpse, so could I see
her a second time. However, inasmuch as she did not show till
evening came on I arose and repaired hither, but of my exceeding
agitation for the ardour of love to her I was powerless to touch
meat or drink, and my sleep was broken by the excess of desire
for her which had homed in my heart. And now, O my brother
Attaf, I have made known to thee whatso betided me.” When
the host heard these words, he was certified that the house
whereof Ja’afar spoke was his house and the lattice his own lattice
and the lovely and lovesome young lady his wife the daughter of
his paternal uncle, so he said in his thought, “There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great. Verily we are Allah’s and unto Him shall we return!”
But presently he regained himself in the nobility of his nature,
and he continued, “O Ja’afar, thine intent is pure for that the
dame thou sawest yesterday was divorced by her husband; and
I will straightway fare to her father and bespeak him to the end
that none may lay hand upon her; and then will I return and
let thee ken all concerning her.” So saying he arose and went
at once to his cousin-wife<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8083" id="noteref-8083" epub:type="noteref">8083</a> who greeted him and kissing his hand
said to him, “Is thy guest a-going?” Said he, “By no means:
the cause of my coming to thee is not his going, the reason
thereof is my design of sending thee to the home of thy people,
for that thy father anon met me in the market-street and declared
to me that thy mother is dying of a colick, and said to me:—Go
send her daughter without delay so that she may see her
parent alive and meet her once more.” Accordingly the young wife
arose; and, hardly knowing how she moved for tears at such tidings,
she took her slave-girls with her and repairing to her home rapped
at the door, and her mother who opened to her cried on seeing
her, “May this thy coming (Inshallah!) be well, O my daughter,
but how is it thou comest thus unexpected?” “Inshallah!”
said the wife, “thou art at rest from the colick?” and the mother
rejoined, “Who told thee I was colicky? but pass thou within.”
So she entered the court and her father, Abdullah Chelebi hight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8084" id="noteref-8084" epub:type="noteref">8084</a>
hearing her footstep from an inner room, asked, “What is there
to do?” “Thou mettest anon,” replied his daughter, “Attaf thy
son-in-law in the Bazar and didst tell him that my mother was
sore afflicted with a colick.” Hearing this he exclaimed, “This day
I went not once to the market-street nor have I seen a soul!” Now
they had not ceased conversing ere the door was rapped; and as
the slave girls opened it, they saw porters laden with the young
lady’s gear and garments and they led the men into the court
where the father asked them, “Who sent these stuffs?” “Attaf,”
they replied, and setting down their loads within went their way.
Then the father turned to his daughter and said to her, “What
deed hast done that my son-in-law bade take up thy gear and
have it sent after thee?” And the mother said to him, “Hold thy
peace and speak not such speech lest the honour of the house be
blamed and shamed.” And as they were talking, behold, up came
Attaf companied by a party of friends when his father-in-law
asked him, “Wherefore hast thou done on this wise?” “To-day,”
answered he, “there came from me a wrongous oath: on account
of my inclination to thy daughter my heart is dark as night
whereas her good name is whiter than my turband and ever
bright.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8085" id="noteref-8085" epub:type="noteref">8085</a> Furthermore an occasion befel and this oath fell from my
mouth and I bade her be the owner of herself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8086" id="noteref-8086" epub:type="noteref">8086</a> And now will I
beweep the past and straightway set her free.” So saying he
wrote a writ of repudiation and returning to Ja’afar said, “From
early dawn I have wearied myself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8087" id="noteref-8087" epub:type="noteref">8087</a> for thy sake and have so acted
that no man can lay hand upon her. And at last thou mayst now
enjoy life and go to the gardens and the Hammams and take thy
pleasure until the days of her widowhood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8088" id="noteref-8088" epub:type="noteref">8088</a> be gone by.” Replied
Ja’afar, “Allah quicken thee for what thou wroughtest of kindness
to me,” and Attaf rejoined, “Find for thyself something thou
requirest, O my brother.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8089" id="noteref-8089" epub:type="noteref">8089</a> Then he fell to taking him every day
amongst the crowd of pleasure-seekers and solacing him with a
show of joyous spectacles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8090" id="noteref-8090" epub:type="noteref">8090</a> till the term of divorce had sped, when
he said to the Wazir, “O Ja’afar, I would counsel thee with an
especial counsel.” “And what may it be, O my brother?” quoth
the other; and quoth he, “Know, O my lord, that many of the
folk have found the likeness between thy Honour and Ja’afar the
Barmecide, wherefore must I fain act on this wise. I will bring
thee a troop of ten Mamelukes and four servants on horseback,
with whom do thou fare privily and by night forth the city and
presently transmit to me tidings from outside the walls that thou
the Grand Wazir, Ja’afar the Barmecide, art recalled to court and
bound thither from Egypt upon business ordered by the Sultan.
Hereat the Governor of Damascus, ’Abd al-Malik bin Marwán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8091" id="noteref-8091" epub:type="noteref">8091</a>
and the Grandees of Syria will flock forth to meet and greet thee
with fêtes and feasts, after which do thou send for the young lady’s
sire and of him ask her to wife. Then I will summon the Kazi
and witnesses and will write out without stay or delay the marriage-writ
with a dower of a thousand dinars the while thou makest
ready for wayfare, and if thou journey to Homs or to Hamah
do thou alight at whatso place ever pleaseth thee. Also I will
provide thee of spending-money as much as thy soul can desire
and supply to thee raiment and gear, horses and bât-animals, tents
and pavilions of the cheap and of the dear, all thou canst require.
So what sayest thou concerning this counsel?” “Fair fall it for
the best of rede which hath no peer,” replied Ja’afar. Hereupon
Attaf arose and gathering his men about his guest sent him forth
the city when the Minister wrote a writ and despatched it by
twenty horsemen with a trader to inform the Governor of Syria
that Ja’afar the Barmecide was passing that way and was
about to visit Damascus on the especial service of the Sultan.
So the Kapújí<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8092" id="noteref-8092" epub:type="noteref">8092</a> entered Damascus and read out the Wazirial
letter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8093" id="noteref-8093" epub:type="noteref">8093</a> announcing Ja’afar’s return from Egypt. Hereat the Governor
arose and after sending a present of provisions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8094" id="noteref-8094" epub:type="noteref">8094</a> without the walls
bade pitch the tents, and the Grandees of Syria rode forth to meet
the Minister, and the Headmen of the Province set out to greet
him, and he entered with all honour and consideration. It was
indeed a day fit to be numbered among the days of a man’s life,
a day of general joyance for those present, and they read the
Farmán and they offered the food and the forage to the Chamberlain
and thus it became known to one and all of the folk that a
writ of pardon had come to Ja’afar’s hands and on this wise the
bruit went abroad, far and near, and the Grandees brought him all
manner of presents. After this Ja’afar sent to summon the young
lady’s father and as soon as he appeared in his presence, said
to him, “Thy daughter hath been divorced?” and said the other
“Yes; she is at home with me.” Quoth the Minister, “I would
fain take her to wife;” and quoth the father, “Here am I ready
to send her as thy handmaid.” The Governor of Sham added,
“I will assume charge of the dowry,” and the damsel’s father
rejoined, “It hath already come to hand.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8095" id="noteref-8095" epub:type="noteref">8095</a> Hereat they summoned
the Kazi and wrote out the writ of Ja’afar’s marriage; and,
having ended the ceremony, they distributed meat and drink to
the poor in honour of the wedding, and Abd al-Malik bin Marwan
said to Ja’afar, “Deign, O my lord, come hither with me and
become my guest, and I will set apart for thee a place wherein
thou canst consummate thy marriage.” But the other replied,
“Nay, I may not do so; I am sent on public affairs by the Commander
of the Faithful and I purpose setting off with my bride
and marching without further delay.” The Grandees of Syria
spent that night until morning without any being able to snatch
a moment of sleep, and as soon as dawned the day Ja’afar sent
to summon his father-in-law and said, “On the morrow I design
setting forth, and I desire that my bride be ready for the road;”
whereto replied the other, “Upon my head be it and my eyes!”
Then Abdullah Chelebi fared homewards and said to his daughter,
“O my child, Attaf hath divorced thee from bed and from board,
whereas Sultan Ja’afar the Bermaki hath taken thee to wife, and
on Allah is the repairing of our broken fortunes and the fortifying
of our hearts.” And she held her peace for displeasure
by cause that she loved Attaf on account of the blood-tie and
his exceeding great generosity. But on the next day Ja’afar
sent a message to her sire informing him that the march would
begin about mid-afternoon and that he wished him to make all
ready, so the father did accordingly; and when Attaf heard
thereof he sent supplies and spending-money.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8096" id="noteref-8096" epub:type="noteref">8096</a> At the time
appointed the Minister took horse escorted by the Governor and
the Grandees, and they brought out the mule-litter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8097" id="noteref-8097" epub:type="noteref">8097</a> wherein was
the bride, and the procession rode onwards until they had reached
the Dome of the Birds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8098" id="noteref-8098" epub:type="noteref">8098</a> whereat the Minister bade them return
home and they obeyed him and farewelled him. But on the ride
back they all met Attaf coming from the city, and he reined in
his horse and saluted the Governor and exchanged salams with
his companions, who said to him, “Now at the very time we are
going in thou comest out.” Attaf made answer, “I wotted not
that he would set forth this day, but as soon as I was certified
that he had mounted I sent to summon his escort and came forth
a-following him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8099" id="noteref-8099" epub:type="noteref">8099</a> To this the Governor replied, “Go catch them
up at the Dome of the Birds, where they are now halting.”
Attaf followed this counsel and reaching the place alighted from
his mare, and approaching Ja’afar embraced him and cried,
“Laud to the Lord, O brother mine, who returneth thee to thy
home with fortunes repaired and heart fortified;” and said the
Minister, “O Attaf, Allah place it in my power to requite thee;
but cease thou not to write me and apprise me of thy tidings;
and for the nonce I order thee to return hence and not to lie the
night save in thine own house.” And his host did his bidding
whilst the cousin-wife hearing his voice thrust her head out of the
litter and looked upon him with flowing tears, understanding the
length to which his generosity had carried him. So fared it with
Attaf and his affair; but now give ear to what befel him from
Abd al-Malik bin Marwan. As they hied them home one who
hated the generous man asked the Governor, “Wottest thou the
wherefore he went forth to farewell his quondam guest at so
late a time as this?” “Why so?” answered the other; and the
detractor continued, “Ja’afar hath tarried four months as a guest
in his household, and disguised so that none save the host knew
him, and now Attaf fared not forth for his sake but because of the
woman.” “What woman?” enquired the Governor, and the
other replied, “His whilom wife, whom he divorced for the sake
of his stranger, and married her to him; so this day he followeth
to enjoin him once more concerning the Government of Syria
which perchance is promised to him. And ’tis better that thou
breakfast upon him ere he sup upon thee.” The other enquired,
“And whose daughter is she, is not her sire Abdullah Chelebi?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8100" id="noteref-8100" epub:type="noteref">8100</a>
Whereto the man answered, “Yes, O my lord, and I repeat that
she was put away to the intent that Ja’afar might espouse her.”
When the Governor heard these words, he was wroth with wrath
galore than which naught could be more, and he hid his anger
from Attaf for a while of time until he had devised a device to
compass his destruction. At last, one day of the days he bade cast
the corpse of a murthered man into his enemy’s garden and after
the body was found by spies he had sent to discover the slayer,
he summoned Attaf and asked him, “Who murthered yon man
within thy grounds?” Replied the other, “’Twas I slew him.”
“And why didst slay him?” cried the Governor, “and what harm
hath he wrought thee?” But the generous one replied, “O my
lord, I have confessed to the slaughter of this man in order that
I and only I may be mulcted in his blood-wite lest the neighbours
say:—By reason of Attaf’s garden we have been condemned to
pay his fine.” Quoth Abd al-Malik, “Why should I want to take
mulcts from the folk? Nay; I would command according to
Holy Law and even as Allah hath ordered, ‘A life for a life.’”
He then turned for testimony to those present and asked them,
“What said this man?” and they answered, “He said:—I slew
him.” “Is the accused in his right mind or Jinn-mad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8101" id="noteref-8101" epub:type="noteref">8101</a>?” pursued
the Governor; and they said, “In his senses.” Then quoth
the Governor to the Mufti, “O Efendi, deliver me thine official
decision according to that thou heardest from the accused’s
mouth;” and the Judge pronounced and indited his sentence
upon the criminal according to his confession. Hereupon the
Governor gave order for his slaves to plunder the house and
bastinado the owner; then he called for the headsman, but the
Notables interfered and cried, “Give him a delay, for thou hast
no right to slay him without further evidence; and better send
him to gaol.” Now all Damascus was agitated and excited by
this affair, which came upon the folk so suddenly and unforeseen.
And Attaf’s friends<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8102" id="noteref-8102" epub:type="noteref">8102</a> and familiars came down upon the Governor
and went about spreading abroad that the generous man had not
spoken such words save in fear lest his neighbours be molested
and be mulcted for a murther which they never committed, and
that he was wholly innocent of such crime. So Abd al-Malik
bin Marwan summoned them and said, “And ye plead that
the accused is Jinn-mad this were folly, for he is the prince
of intelligent men: I was resolved to let him live until the
morrow; but I have been thwarted and this very night I will
send and have him strangled.” Hereupon he returned him to
prison and ordered the gaoler to do him die before day might
break. But the man waxed wroth with exceeding wrath to hear
the doom devised for Attaf and having visited him in prison
said to him, “Verily the Governor is determined to slay thee for
he was not satisfied with the intercession made for thee by the
folk or even with taking the legal blood-wite.” Hereat Attaf wept
and cried, “Allah (be He magnified and glorified!) hath assigned
unto every death a cause. I desired but to do good amongst the
garden folk and prevent their being fined; and now this benevolence
hath become the reason of my ruin.” Then, after much
‘say and said’ the gaoler spake as follows, “Why talk after such
fashion? I am resolved to set thee free and to ransom thee with
my life; and at this very moment I will strike off thy chains and
deliver thee from him. But do thou arise and tear my face and
pluck out my beard and rend my raiment; then, after thrusting a
gag<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8103" id="noteref-8103" epub:type="noteref">8103</a> into my mouth wend thy ways and save thy life and leave
me to bear all blame.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8104" id="noteref-8104" epub:type="noteref">8104</a> Quoth Attaf, “Allah requite thee for
me with every weal!” Accordingly the gaoler did as he had
undertaken and his prisoner went forth unhurt and at once followed
the road to Baghdad. So far concerning him; but now hear thou
what befel the Governor of Syria, Abd al-Malik bin Marwan.
He took patience till midnight, when he arose and fared
accompanied by the headsman to the gaol that he might witness
the strangling of Attaf; but lo and behold! he found the prison-door
wide open and the keeper in sore sorrow with his raiment all
rent to rags and his beard plucked out and his face scratched and
the blood trickling from his four sides and his case was the
miserablest of cases. So they removed the gag from his mouth
and the Governor asked him, “Who did with thee on this wise?”
and the man answered, “O my lord, yesternight, about the middle
thereof, a gang of vagabonds and ne’er-do-wells as they were ’Ifrits
of our lord Sulayman (upon whom be The Peace!), not one of
whom I recognised, came upon me and ere I was ware of them
they broke down the prison door and killed me;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8105" id="noteref-8105" epub:type="noteref">8105</a> and when I
would have cried aloud and shouted for aid they placed yonder
gag in my mouth, then they wounded me and shredded my dress
and left me in the state thou seest. Moreover they took Attaf
after breaking his chains and said to him:—Go and lay thy
complaint before the Sultan.” Now those who accompanied
the Governor said, “This be a gaoler and the son of a gaoler,
nor during all his days hath anyone charged him with letting a
prisoner out of hand.” Quoth Abd al-Malik to the wounded man
“Hie thee to thy house and stay there;” whereat he straightway
arose and went his ways. After this the Governor took horse, he
and his escort; and all rode off to search for Attaf during a term
of four days and some of them dug and dug deep down while the
others returned after a bootless errand, and reported that they
had failed to find him. Such was the case with the Governor of
Syria; and now give ear to the adventure of Attaf. He left not
wayfaring until but a single stage remained between him and
Baghdad when robbers came upon him and stripped him of all his
clothes, so that he was compelled to enter the capital in foulest
condition, naked even as his mother bare him. And after some
charitable wight had thrown an old robe about him and bound his
head with a clout (and his unshorn hair fell over his eyes)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8106" id="noteref-8106" epub:type="noteref">8106</a> he fell
to asking for the mansion of the Wazir Ja’afar and the folk guided
him thereto. But when he would have entered the attendants
suffered him not; so he stood at that gate till an old man joined
him. Attaf enquired of him saying, “Hast thou with thee, O
Shaykh, an ink-case and pens and paper?” and the other replied,
“I have; but what is thy need thereof? tell me, so may I write
for thee.” “I will write myself,” rejoined Attaf; and when the
old man handed to him the gear, he took seat and indited an
address to Ja’afar informing him of all that passed from first to
last, and especially of his own foul plight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8107" id="noteref-8107" epub:type="noteref">8107</a> Presently he returned
the ink-case and reed pens to the Shaykh; and, going up to the
gate, asked those standing about the doors, “Will ye not admit for
me this missive and place it in the hand of his Highness, Ja’afar
the Bermaki, the Wazir?” “Give it here,” said they, and one of
them took it with the intent of handing it to the Minister when
suddenly the cannon roared;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8108" id="noteref-8108" epub:type="noteref">8108</a> the palace was in a hubbub and each
and everyone cried, “What is to do?” Hereat many voices replied,
“The Sultan, who hath been favoured with a man-child, biddeth
decorate the city for seven days.” Hereat the attendant, who had
charged himself with the letter, threw it in that confusion from his
hand and Attaf was led to gaol as a vagrant. Anon Ja’afar took
horse and, after letting read the Sultan’s rescript about the city-decorations,
gave command that all the prisoners be released,
Attaf amongst the number. As he issued forth the gaol he beheld
all the streets adorned with flags and tapestry, and when
evening approached eating-cloths and trays of food were set
and all fell-to, while sundry said to Attaf who was in pauper
plight, “Come and eat thou;” for it was a popular feast.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8109" id="noteref-8109" epub:type="noteref">8109</a>
And affairs went on after this same fashion and the bands made
music and cannon was fired until ended the week of decoration
during which the folk ceased not to-ing and fro-ing. As evening
evened Attaf entered a cathedral-mosque and prayed the night-prayers
when he was accosted by the eunuchs who cried, “Arise
and gang thy gait, that we may close the mosque-door, O Attaf,”
for his name had become known. He replied, “O man, the Apostle
of Allah saith, ‘Whoso striveth for good is as the doer thereof and
the doer is of the people of Paradise:’ so suffer me to sleep here
in some corner;” but quoth the other, “Up with thee and be off:
yesterday they stole me a bit of matting and to-night I will bolt
the door nor allow any to sleep here. And indeed the Apostle of
Allah (whom the Almighty save and assain!) hath forbidden sleep
o’ nights in the mosques.” Attaf had no competence to persuade
the Castrato by placing himself under his protection, albeit he
prayed him sore saying, “I am a stranger in the city nor have
I knowledge of any, so do thou permit me here to pass this
one night and no more.” But as he was again refused he
went forth into the thoroughfares where the street dogs barked at
him, and thence he trudged on to the market where the watchmen
and warders cried out at him, till at last he entered a ruinous
house where he stumbled when walking and fell over something
which proved to be a youth lately murthered, and in tripping
he fell upon his face and his garments were bewrayed and crimsoned
with blood. And as he stood in doubt as to what must be done
the Wali and the watch, who were going round the town by night,
met him face to face; and as soon as they saw him all rushed at
him in a body and seizing him bore him to the gaol. Here we
leave speaking of him; and now return we to Ja’afar and what
befel him. After he had set out from Damascus and sent back
Attaf from the Dome of the Birds he said in his mind, “Thou art
about to consummate marriage with a damsel and to travel until
thou shalt reach Baghdad, so meanwhile up and take thee an ewer
of water and make the Wuzú and pray.” However, as he purposed
that evening to go in unto the wife of Attaf, controversy
forewent compliments<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8110" id="noteref-8110" epub:type="noteref">8110</a> and the tent-pitchers, who were sent on
to the next station set up the pavilion of the bride and the other
tents. Ja’afar took patience until every eye however wakeful
waxed sleep-full, at which time he rose up and went in to Attaf’s
wife who, the moment she saw him enter, covered her face with
her hands as from a stranger. “The Peace be upon thee!” said
he and said she, “With thee also be The Peace and the ruth of
Allah and His blessings.” Then he continued, “O daughter of
my father’s brother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8111" id="noteref-8111" epub:type="noteref">8111</a> why hast thou placed thy hand upon thy face?
In the lawful there be naught of shameful.” “True, O my lord,”
she replied, “but Modesty is a part of Religion. If to one the like
of thee it be a light matter that the man who guested thee and
served thee with his coin and his case be treated on this wise and
thou have the heart to take his mate from him, then am I but a
slave between thy hands.” “Art thou the divorced wife of Attaf?”
asked Ja’afar, and she answered, “I am.” Quoth he, “And why
did thy husband on such wise?” and quoth she, “The while I
stood watering plants at the window, thy Highness deigned look
upon me and thou toldest thy love to Attaf, who forthright put
me away and made me wife to thy Worship. And this is wherefore
I conceal from thee my face.” Ja’afar cried, “Thou art now
unlawful to him and licit to me; but presently thou shalt become
illicit to me and legitimate to thy husband: so from this time
forth thou art dearer and more honourable to me than my eyes
and my mother and my sister. But for the moment thy return to
Damascus is not possible for fear of foolish tongues lest they prattle
and say:—Attaf went forth to farewell Ja’afar, and his wife lay the
night with the former, and thus have the back-bones had a single
lappet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8112" id="noteref-8112" epub:type="noteref">8112</a> However I will bear thee to Baghdad where I will stablish
thee in a spacious and well furnished lodging with ten slave girls
and eunuchs to serve thee; and, as long as thou abide with me, I
will give thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8113" id="noteref-8113" epub:type="noteref">8113</a> every day five golden ducats and every month a
suit of sumptuous clothes. Moreover everything in thy lodging
shall be thine; and whatever gifts and offerings be made to thee
they shall be thy property, for the folk will fancy thee to be my
bride and will entertain thee and escort thee to the Hammams and
present thee with sumptuous dresses. After this fashion thou shalt
pass thy days in joyance and thou shalt abide with me in highmost
honour and esteem and worship till what time we see that can be
done. So from this moment forth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8114" id="noteref-8114" epub:type="noteref">8114</a> throw away all fear and hereafter
be happy in heart and high in spirits, for that now thou standest
me in stead of mother and sister and here naught shall befal thee
save weal. And now my first desire to thee which burned in my
soul hath been quenched and exchanged for brotherly love yet
stronger than what forewent it.” So Attaf’s wife rejoiced with
exceeding joy; and, as they pursued their journey, Ja’afar ceased
not to clothe her in the finest of clothes, so that men might honour
her as the Wazir’s Consort; and ever to entreat her with yet
increasing deference. This endured until they entered Baghdad-city
where the attendants bore her Takhtrawán into the Minister’s
Harem and an apartment was set apart for her even as he had
promised, and she was provided with a monthly allowance of a
thousand dinars and all the comforts and conveniences and
pleasures whereof he had bespoken her; nor did he ever allow his
olden flame for her to flare up again, and he never went near
her; but sent messengers to promise her a speedy reunion with
her mate. Such was the case of Ja’afar and Attaf’s wife; and
now give ear to what befel and betided the Minister during his
first reception by his liege lord who had sorely regretted his
departure and was desolated by the loss of him. As soon as he
presented himself before the Caliph, who rejoiced with exceeding
joy and returned his salute and his deprecation of evil,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8115" id="noteref-8115" epub:type="noteref">8115</a> the Commander
of the Faithful asked him, “Where was the bourne of this
thy wayfare?” and he answered, “Damascus.” “And where didst
alight?” “In the house of one Attaf hight,” rejoined Ja’afar,
who recounted all that his host had done with him from the
beginning to the end. The Prince of True Believers took patience,
until he had told his story and then cried to his Treasurer
saying, “Hie thee hence and open the Treasury and bring me forth
a certain book.” And when this was done he continued, “Hand
that volume to Ja’afar.” Now when the Minister took it and read
it he found written therein all that had occurred between Attaf
and himself and he left not reading till he came to the time when
the twain, host and guest, had parted and each had farewelled other
and Attaf had fared homewards. Hereupon the Caliph cried to
him, “Close the book at what place it completeth the recital of
thy bidding adieu to Attaf and of his returning to his own place,
so shalt thou understand how it was I said to thee:—Near me not
until thou bring that which is contained in this volume.” Then the
Commander of the Faithful restored the book to the Treasurer
saying, “Take this and set it in the bibliotheca;” then, turning to
Ja’afar he observed, “Verily Almighty Allah (be He glorified
and magnified!) hath deigned show thee whatso I read therein
until I fell a-weeping and a-laughing at one and the same time.
So now do thou retire and hie thee home.” Ja’afar did his
bidding and reassumed the office of Wazir after fairer fashion
than he was before. And now return we to the purport of our
story as regardeth the designs of Attaf and what befel him when
they took him out of gaol. They at once led him to the Kazi
who began by questioning him, saying, “Woe to thee, didst thou
murther this Háshimí?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8116" id="noteref-8116" epub:type="noteref">8116</a> Replied he, “Yes, I did!” “And
why killedst thou him?” “I found him in yonder ruin and, I
struck him advisedly and slew him!” “Art thou in thy right
senses?” “Yea, verily.” “What may be thy name?” “I am
hight Attaf.” Now when the Judge heard this confession, which
was thrice repeated, he wrote a writ to the Mufti and acquainted
him with the contention: and the divine after delivering his
decision produced a book and therein indited the <i><span xml:lang="fr">procès-verbal</span></i>.
Then he sent notice thereof to Ja’afar the Wazir for official order
to carry out the sentence and the Minister took the document and
affixing his seal and signature thereto gave order for the execution.
So they bore Attaf away and led him to the gallows-foot whither
he was followed by a world of folk in number as the dust; and,
as they set him under the tree Ja’afar the Wazir, who was riding
by with his suite at the time, suddenly espied a crowd going forth
the city. Thereupon he summoned the Sobáshí<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8117" id="noteref-8117" epub:type="noteref">8117</a> who came up to
him and kissed his knee. “What is the object of this gathering
of folk who be manifold as the dust and what do they want?”
quoth the Wazir; and quoth the officer, “We are wending to hang<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8118" id="noteref-8118" epub:type="noteref">8118</a>
a Syrian who hath murthered a youth of Sharif family.” “And
who may be this Syrian?” asked the Wazir, and the other
answered, “One hight Attaf.” But when Ja’afar heard the word
Attaf he cried out with a mighty loud outcry and said, “Hither
with him.” So after loosing the noose from his neck they set him
before the Wazir who regarding him at once recognised his
whilome host albeit he was in the meanest of conditions, so he
sprang up and threw himself upon him and he in turn threw himself
upon his sometime guest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8119" id="noteref-8119" epub:type="noteref">8119</a> “What condition be this?” quoth
Ja’afar as soon as he could speak, and quoth Attaf, “This cometh
of my acquaintance with thee which hath brought me to such
pass.” Hereupon the twain swooned clean away and fell down
fainting on the floor, and when they came to themselves and could
rise to their feet Ja’afar the Wazir sent his friend Attaf to the
Hammam with a sumptuous suit of clothes which he donned as he
came out. Then the attendants led him to the Wazirial mansion
where both took seat and they drank wine and ate the early meal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8120" id="noteref-8120" epub:type="noteref">8120</a>
and after their coffee they sat together in converse. And when
they had rested and were cheered, Ja’afar said, “Do thou acquaint
me with all that betided thee from the time we took leave each of
other until this day and date.” So Attaf fell to telling him how
he had been entreated by Abd al-Malik bin Marwan, Governor of
Syria; how he had been thrown into prison and how his enemy
came thither by night with intent to strangle him; also how the
gaoler devised a device to save him from slaughter and how he
had fled nor ceased flight till he drew near Baghdad when
robbers had stripped him; how he had lost an opportunity of
seeing the Wazir because the city had been decorated; and,
lastly, what had happened to him through being driven from the
Cathedral-mosque; brief, he recounted all from commencement to
conclusion. Hereupon the Minister loaded him with benefits and
presently gave orders to renew the marriage-ceremony between
man and wife; and she seeing her husband led in to pay her the
first visit lost her senses, and her wits flew from her head and she
cried aloud, “Would Heaven I wot if this be on wake or the
imbroglio of dreams!” So she started like one frightened and a
moment after she threw herself upon her husband and cried, “Say
me, do I view thee in vision or really in the flesh?” whereto he
replied, “In the world of sense and no sweven is this.” Then he
took seat beside her and related to her all that had befallen him of
hardships and horrors till he was taken from under the Hairibee;
and she on her part recounted how she had dwelt under Ja’afar’s
roof, eating well and drinking well and dressing well and in
honour and worship the highmost that might be. And the joy
of this couple on reunion was perfect. But as for Ja’afar when the
morning morrowed, he arose and fared for the Palace; then,
entering the presence, he narrated to the Caliph all that had
befallen Attaf, art and part; and the Commander of the Faithful
rejoined, “Indeed this adventure is the most wondrous that can
be, and the most marvellous that ever came to pass.” Presently
he called to the Treasurer and bade him bring the book a second
time from the Treasury, and when it was brought the Prince of
True Believers took it, and handing it to Ja’afar, said to him, “Open
and read.” So he perused the whole tale of Attaf with himself
the while his liege lord again wept and laughed at the same
moment and said, “In very deed, all things strange and rare are
written and laid up amongst the treasuries of the Kings; and
therefor I cried at thee in my wrath and forbade thee my presence
until thou couldst answer the question, What is there in this
volume? and thou couldst comprehend the cause of my tears and
my smiles. Then thou wentest from before me and wast driven
by doom of Destiny until befel thee with Attaf that which did
befal; and in fine thou returnedst with the reply I required.” Then
the Caliph enrobed Ja’afar with a sumptuous honour-robe and
said to the attendants, “Bring hither to me Attaf.” So they went
out and brought him before the Prince of True Believers; and the
Syrian standing between his hands blessed the Sovran and prayed
for his honour and glory in permanence of prosperity and felicity.
Hereat quoth the Caliph, “O Attaf, ask whatso thou wishest!”
and quoth the generous man, “O King of the Age, I pray only
thy pardon for Abd al-Malik bin Marwan.” “For that he harmed
thee?” asked Harun al-Rashid, and Attaf answered, “O my lord,
the transgression came not from him, but from Him who caused
him work my wrong; and I have freely pardoned him. Also do
thou, O my lord, write a Farmán with thine own hand certifying
that I have sold to the gaoler, and have received from him
the price thereof, all my slaves and estates in fullest tale and
most complete. Moreover deign thou appoint him inspector over
the Governor of Syria<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8121" id="noteref-8121" epub:type="noteref">8121</a> and forward to him a signet-ring by way
of sign that no petition which doth not bear that seal shall be
accepted or even shall be heard and lastly transmit all this with
a Chamberlain unto Damascus.” Now all the citizens of Syria
were expecting some ill-turn from the part of Attaf, and with this
grievous thought they were engrossed, when suddenly tidings from
Baghdad were bruited abroad; to wit, that a Kapuji was coming
on Attaf’s business. Hereat the folk feared with exceeding great
affright and fell to saying, “Gone is the head of Abd al-Malik bin
Marwan, and gone all who could say aught in his defence.” And
when the arrival of the Chamberlain was announced all fared
forth to meet and greet him, and he entered on a day of flocking
and crowding,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8122" id="noteref-8122" epub:type="noteref">8122</a> which might be truly numbered amongst the days
and lives of men. And presently he produced the writ of
indemnity, and pardon may not be procured save by one duly
empowered to pardon. Then he sent for the gaoler and committed
to him the goods and chattels of Attaf, together with the signet
and the appointment of supervisor over the Governor of Syria with
an especial Farman that no order be valid unless sealed with the
superior’s seal. Nor was Abd al-Malik bin Marwan less rejoiced
that the adventure had ended so well for him when he saw the
Kapuji returning Baghdad-wards that he might report all concerning
his mission. But as for Attaf, his friend Ja’afar bestowed
upon him seigniories and presented him with
property and moneys exceeding tenfold
what he had whilome owned
and made him more
prosperous than he
had ever
been aforetime.</p>

  <h3 class="c015"><em>NOTE ON THE TALE OF ATTAF.</em></h3>
</div>

<p class="c027">Mr. Alexander J. Cotheal, of New York, a correspondent who already on
sundry occasions has rendered me able aid and advice, was kind enough to send
me his copy of the Tale of Attaf (the “C. MS.” of the foregoing pages). It
is a small 4to of pp. 334, size 5¾ by 8 inches, with many of the leaves injured and
repaired; and written in a variety of handwritings, here a mere scribble, there
regular and legible as printed Arabic. A fly-leaf inserted into the Arabic binding
contains in cursive hand the title, “A Book embracing many Tales of the Tales of
the Kings and named ‘Stories from the Thousand Nights and a Night.’” And
a note at the end supplies the date; “And the finish thereof was on Fifth Day
(Thursday), 9th from the beginning of the auspicious month Rabí’a 2nd, in the
year 1096 of the Hijrah of the Apostle, upon whom be the choicest of blessings
and the fullest of greetings; and Allah prospereth what he pleaseth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8123" id="noteref-8123" epub:type="noteref">8123</a> and
praise be to God the One.” Thus (A.H. 1096 = A.D. 1685) the volume is upwards
of 200 years old. It was bought by Mr. Cotheal many years ago with
other matters among the effects of a deceased American missionary who had
brought it from Syria.</p>

<p>The “Tale of Attaf” occupies pp. 10–50, and the end is abrupt. The treatment
of the “Novel” contrasts curiously with that of the Chavis MS. which
forms my text, and whose directness and simplicity give it a European and
even classical character. It is an excellent study of the liberties allowed to
themselves by Eastern editors and scribes. In the Cotheal MS. the tone is
distinctly literary, abounding in verse (sometimes repeated from other portions
of The Nights), and in Saj’a or Cadence which the copyist sometimes denotes
by marks in red ink. The wife of Attaf is a much sterner and more important
personage than in my text: she throws water upon her admirer as he gazes
upon her from the street, and when compelled to marry him by her father, she
“gives him a bit of her mind” as forcibly and stingingly as if she were of
“Anglo-Saxon” blood; <i><span xml:lang="la">e.g.</span></i> “An thou have in thee aught of manliness and
generosity thou wilt divorce me even as he did.” Sundry episodes like that of
the brutal Eunuch at Ja’afar’s door, and the Vagabond in the Mosque are also
introduced; but upon this point I need say no more, as Mr. Cotheal shall now
speak for himself.</p>
