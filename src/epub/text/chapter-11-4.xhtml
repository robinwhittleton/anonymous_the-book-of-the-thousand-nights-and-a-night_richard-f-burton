			<h2 epub:type="title">Harun al-Rashid and the Woman of the Barmecides<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5187" id="noteref-5187" epub:type="noteref">5187</a></h2>

<p>They tell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5188" id="noteref-5188" epub:type="noteref">5188</a> that Harun Al-Rashid was sitting one day to abate
grievances, when there came up to him a woman and said, “O
Commander of the Faithful, may Allah perfect thy purpose and
gladden thee in whatso He hath given thee and increase thee in
elevation! Indeed, thou hast done justice and wrought equitably.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5189" id="noteref-5189" epub:type="noteref">5189</a>
Quoth the Caliph to those who were present with him, “Know ye
what this one meaneth by her saying?” and quoth they, “Of a
surety, she meaneth not otherwise than well, O Prince of True
Believers.” Al-Rashid rejoined; “Nay, in this she purposeth only
to curse me. As for her saying, ‘Allah perfect thy purpose,’
she hath taken it from the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">

    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When thy purpose is effected beginneth its decay; ✿ when they say ‘Thy wish is won’ feel thou sure ’twill pass away.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">As for her saying ‘Allah gladden thee in whatso He hath given
thee,’ she took it from the saying of Almighty Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5190" id="noteref-5190" epub:type="noteref">5190</a> ’Till,
whenas they were gladdened in that which they were given, We
suddenly laid hold of them and lo, they were in despair!’ As for
her saying, ‘Allah increase thee in elevation!’ she took it from
the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">‘No flier flieth however tall ✿ but as he flieth shall come to fall.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">And as for her saying, ‘Indeed, thou hast done justice and
wrought equitably,’ ’tis from the saying of the Almighty, ‘If
ye swerve<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5191" id="noteref-5191" epub:type="noteref">5191</a> or lag behind or turn aside, verily, Allah of that which
ye do is well aware;’ and ‘As for the swervers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5192" id="noteref-5192" epub:type="noteref">5192</a> they are fuel for
Hell.’” Then he turned to the woman and asked her, “Is it not
thus?” Answered she; “Yes, O Commander of the Faithful,”
and quoth he, “What prompted thee to this?” Quoth she,
“Thou slewest my parents and my kinsfolk and despoiledst their
good.” Enquired the Caliph, “Whom meanest thou?” and
she replied, “I am of the house of Barmak.” Then said he to her,
“As for the dead, they are of those who are past away, and it
booteth not to speak of them; but, as for that which I took of
wealth, it shall forthright be restored to thee, yea, and more
than it.” And he was bountiful to her to the uttermost of his
bounties.</p>
