			<h2 epub:type="title">The Story of the Three Sharpers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6691" id="noteref-6691" epub:type="noteref">6691</a></h2>

<p>Saying, Verily their adventure is wondrous and their actions
delightsome and marvellous; presently adding——There were
in time of yore three Sharpers who were wont every day in early
morning to prowl forth and to prey, rummaging<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6692" id="noteref-6692" epub:type="noteref">6692</a> among the
mounds which outlay the city. Therein each would find a silver bit
of five parahs or its equivalent, after which the trio would forgather
and buy whatso sufficed them for supper: they would also expend
two Nusfs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6693" id="noteref-6693" epub:type="noteref">6693</a> upon Bast,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6694" id="noteref-6694" epub:type="noteref">6694</a> which is Bhang, and purchase a waxen
taper with the other silver bit. They had hired a cell in the flank
of a Wakálah, a caravanserai without the walls, where they could
sit at ease to solace themselves and eat their Hashísh after lighting
the candle and enjoy their intoxication and consequent merriment
till the noon o’ night. Then they would sleep, again awaking
at day-dawn when they would arise and seek for spoil, according
to their custom, and ransack the heaps where at times they
would hit upon a silverling of five dirhams and at other times a
piece of four; and at eventide they would meet to spend together
the dark hours, and they would expend everything they came
by every day. For a length of time they pursued this path
until, one day of the days, they made for the mounds as was
their wont and went round searching the heaps from morning
to evening without finding even a half-parah; wherefore they
were troubled and they went away and nighted in their cell
without meat or drink. When the next day broke they arose
and repaired for booty, changing the places wherein they were
wont to forage; but none of them found aught; and their breasts
were straitened for lack of a find of dirhams wherewith to buy
them supper. This lasted for three full-told and following days until
hunger waxed hard upon them and vexation; so they said one to
other, “Go we to the Sultan and let us serve him with a sleight,
and each of us three shall claim to be a past master of some craft:
haply Allah Almighty may incline his heart uswards and he may
largesse us with something to expend upon our necessities.”
Accordingly all three agreed to do on this wise and they sought
the Sultan whom they found in the palace-garden. They asked
leave to go in to him, but the Chamberlains refused admission:
so they stood afar off unable to approach the presence. Then
quoth they one to other, “’Twere better we fall to and each smite
his comrade and cry aloud and make a clamour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6695" id="noteref-6695" epub:type="noteref">6695</a> and as soon
as he shall hear us he will send to summon us.” Accordingly
they jostled one another and each took to frapping his fellow,
making the while loud outcries. The Sultan hearing this turmoil
said, “Bring me yonder wights;” and the Chamberlains and
Eunuchs ran out to them and seized them and set them between
the hands of the Sovran. As soon as they stood in the presence
he asked them, “What be the cause of your wrath one against
other?” They answered, “O King of the Age, we are past
masters of crafts, each of us weeting an especial art.” Quoth
the Sultan, “What be your crafts?” and quoth one of the trio,
“O our lord, as for my art I am a jeweller by trade.” The
King exclaimed, “Passing strange! a sharper and a jeweller:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6696" id="noteref-6696" epub:type="noteref">6696</a>
this is a wondrous matter.” And he questioned the second——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the
next night which was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an
thou be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut
short the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious
King, the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is
benefiting and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that
the Sultan asked the second Sharper saying, “And thou, the other,
what may be thy craft?” He answered, “I am a genealogist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6697" id="noteref-6697" epub:type="noteref">6697</a> of
the horse-kind.” So the King glanced at him in surprise and said
to himself, “A sharper yet he claimeth an astounding knowledge!”
Then he left him and put the same question to the third
who said to him, “O King of the Age, verily my art is more
wondrous and marvellous than aught thou hast heard from these
twain: their craft is easy but mine is such that none save I can
discover the right direction thereto or know the first of it from the
last of it.” The Sultan enquired of him, “And what be thy
craft?” Whereto he replied, “My craft is the genealogy of the
sons of Adam.” Hearing these words the Sovran wondered with
extreme wonderment and said in himself, “Verily He informeth
with His secrets the humblest of His creatures! Assuredly these
men, an they speak truth in all they say and it prove soothfast,
are fit for naught except kingship. But I will keep them by me
until the occurrence of some nice contingency wherein I may test
them; then, if they approve themselves good men and trustworthy
of word, I will leave them on life; but if their speech be lying I
will do them die.” Upon this he set apart for them apartments
and rationed them with three cakes of bread and a dish of roast
meat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6698" id="noteref-6698" epub:type="noteref">6698</a> and set over them his sentinels dreading lest they fly. This
case continued for a while till behold, there came to the Sultan
from the land of ’Ajam a present of rarities, amongst which were
two gems whereof one was clear of water and the other was
clouded of colour.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6699" id="noteref-6699" epub:type="noteref">6699</a> The Sultan hent them in hand for a time and
fell to considering them straitly for the space of an hour; after
which he called to mind the first of the three Sharpers, the self-styled
jeweller, and cried, “Bring me the jeweller-man.” Accordingly
they went and brought him and set him before the Sovran
who asked him, “O man, art thou a lapidary?” And when the
Sharper answered “Yes” he gave him the clear-watered stone, saying,
“What may be the price of this gem?”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer
me to survive.” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our later night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sharper
took the jewel in hand and turned it rightwards and leftwards and
considered the outside and pried into the inside; after which he
said to the Sultan, “O my lord, verily this gem containeth a
worm<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6700" id="noteref-6700" epub:type="noteref">6700</a> bred within the heart thereof.” Now when the King heard
these words he waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and commanded
the man’s head to be stricken off, saying, “This jewel is clear of
colour and free of flaw or other default; yet thou chargest it
falsely with containing a worm!” Then he summoned the Linkman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6701" id="noteref-6701" epub:type="noteref">6701</a>
who laid hands on the Sharper and pinioned his elbows and
trussed up his legs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6702" id="noteref-6702" epub:type="noteref">6702</a> like a camel’s and was about to smite his neck
when behold, the Wazir entered the presence and, seeing the
Sovran in high dudgeon and the Sharper under the scymitar, asked
what was to do. The Sultan related to him what had happened
when he drew near to him and said, “O my lord, act not after
this fashion! An thou determine upon the killing of yonder man,
first break the gem and, if thou find therein a worm, thou wilt
know the wight’s word to have been veridical; but an thou find it
sound then strike off his head.” “Right is thy rede,” quoth the
King: then he took in hand the gem and smote it with his
mace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6703" id="noteref-6703" epub:type="noteref">6703</a> and when it brake behold, he found therein the worm
amiddlemost thereof. So he marvelled at the sight and asked the
man, “What proved to thee that it harboured a worm?” “The
sharpness of my sight,” answered the Sharper. Then the Sultan
pardoned him and, admiring his power of vision, addressed his
attendants saying, “Bear him back to his comrades and ration him
with a dish of roast meat and two cakes of bread.” And they did
as he bade them. After some time, on a day of the days, there
came to the King the tribute of ’Ajam-land accompanied with
presents amongst which was a colt whose robe black as night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6704" id="noteref-6704" epub:type="noteref">6704</a>
showed one shade in the sun and another in the shadow. When
the animal was displayed to the Sultan he fell in love with it and
set apart for it a stall and solaced himself at all times by gazing
at it and was wholly occupied with it and sang its praises till they
filled the whole country side. Presently he remembered the
Sharper who claimed to be a genealogist of the horse-kind and
bade him be summoned. So they fared forth and brought him
and set him between the hands of the Sovran who said to him,
“Art thou he who knoweth the breed and descent of horses?”
“Yea verily,” said the man. Then cried the King, “By the truth
of Him who set me upon the necks of His servants and who sayeth
to a thing ‘Be’ and it becometh, an I find aught of error or confusion
in thy words, I will strike off thy head.” “Hearkening and
obedience,” quoth the Sharper. Then they led him to the colt
that he might consider its genealogy. He called aloud to the
groom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6705" id="noteref-6705" epub:type="noteref">6705</a>——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sharper
called aloud to the stirrup-holder and when they brought him he
bade the man back the colt for his inspection. So he mounted
the animal and made it pace to the right and to the left causing it
now to prance and curvet and then to step leisurely, while the
connoisseur looked on and after a time quoth he to the groom,
“’Tis enough!” Then he went in to the presence and stood
between the hands of the King who enquired, “What hast thou
seen in the colt, O Kashmar?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6706" id="noteref-6706" epub:type="noteref">6706</a> Replied the Sharper, “By Allah,
O King of the Age, this colt is of pure and noble blood on the
side of the sire: its action is excellent and all its qualities are
praiseworthy save one; and but for this one it had been perfect
in blood and breed nor had there been on earth’s face its fellow
in horseflesh. But its blemish remaineth a secret.” The Sultan
asked, “And what is the quality which thou blamest?” and the
Sharper answered, “Its sire was noble, but its dam was of other
strain: she it was that brought the blemish and if thou, O my
lord, allow me I will notify it to thee.” “’Tis well, and needs
must thou declare it,” quoth the Sultan. Then said the Sharper,
“Its dam is a buffalo-cow.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6707" id="noteref-6707" epub:type="noteref">6707</a> When the King heard these words
he was wroth with wrath exceeding and he bade the Linkman
take the Sharper and behead him, crying, “O dog! O accursed!
How can a buffalo-cow bear a horse?” The Sharper replied, “O
my lord, the Linkman is in the presence; but send and fetch him
who brought thee the colt and of him make enquiry. If my words
prove true and rightly placed, my skill shall be stablished; but
an they be lies let my head pay forfeit for my tongue. Here
standeth the Linkman and I am between thy hands: thou hast
but to bid him strike off my head!” Thereupon the King sent
for the owner and breeder of the colt and they brought him to the
presence.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
the sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
sent for the owner and breeder of the colt and asked him saying,
“Tell me the truth anent the blood of this colt. Didst thou buy
it or breed it so that it was a rearling of thy homestead?” Said
he, “By Allah, O King of the Age, I will speak naught which is
not sooth, for indeed there hangeth by this colt the strangest
story: were it graven with graver-needles upon the eye-corners
it had been a warning to whoso would be warned. And this it is.
I had a stallion of purest strain whose sire was of the steeds of the
sea;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6708" id="noteref-6708" epub:type="noteref">6708</a> and he was stabled in a stall apart for fear of the evil eye,
his service being entrusted to trusty servants. But one day in
springtide the Syce took the horse into the open and there
picquetted him when behold, a buffalo-cow walked into the
enclosed pasture where the stallion was tethered, and seeing her
he brake his heel-ropes and rushed at her and covered her. She
conceived by him and when her days were completed and her
throwing-time came she suffered sore pains and bare yonder colt.
And all who have seen it or have heard of it were astounded,” said
he, presently adding, “by Allah, O King of the Age, had its dam
been of the mare-kind the colt would have had no equal on earth’s
surface or aught approaching it.” Hereat the Sultan took thought
and marvelled; then, summoning the Sharper he said to him
when present, “O man, thy speech is true and thou art indeed a
genealogist in horseflesh and thou wottest it well. But I would
know what proved to thee that the dam of this colt was a buffalo-cow?”
Said he, “O King, my proof thereof was palpable nor can
it be concealed from any wight of right wits and intelligence and
special knowledge; for the horse’s hoof is round whilst the hooves
of buffaloes are elongated and duck-shaped,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6709" id="noteref-6709" epub:type="noteref">6709</a> and hereby I kenned
that this colt was a jumart, the issue of a cow-buffalo.” The
Sultan was pleased with his words and said, “Ration him with a
plate of roast meat and two cakes of bread;” and they did as
they were bidden. Now for a length of time the third Sharper
was forgotten till one day the Sultan bethought him of the man
who could explain the genealogy of Adam’s sons. So he bade
fetch him and when they brought him into the presence he said,
“Thou art he that knowest the caste and descent of men and
women?” and the other said, “Yes.” Then he commanded the
Eunuchs take him to his wife<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6710" id="noteref-6710" epub:type="noteref">6710</a> and place him before her and cause
him declare her genealogy. So they led him in and set him
standing in her presence and the Sharper considered her for a
while looking from right to left; then he fared forth to the
Sultan who asked him, “What hast thou seen in the Queen?”
Answered he, “O my lord, I saw a somewhat adorned with
loveliness and beauty and perfect grace, with fair stature of symmetrical
trace and with modesty and fine manners and skilful case;
and she is one in whom all good qualities appear on every side,
nor is aught of accomplishments or knowledge concealed from
her and haply in her centre all desirable attributes. Natheless,
O King of the Age, there is a curious point that dishonoureth
her from the which were she free none would outshine her of all
the women of her generation.” Now when the Sultan heard the
words of the Sharper, he sprang hastily to his feet and clapping
hand upon hilt bared his brand and fell upon the man purposing
to slay him;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
fell upon the Sharper with his sword purposing to slay him; but
the Chamberlains and the Eunuchs prevented him saying, “O our
lord, kill him not until his falsehood or his fact shall have been
made manifest to thee.” The Sultan said to him, “What then
appeared to thee in my Queen?” “He<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6711" id="noteref-6711" epub:type="noteref">6711</a> is ferly fair,” said the
man, “but his mother is a dancing-girl, a gypsey.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6712" id="noteref-6712" epub:type="noteref">6712</a> The fury of
the King increased hereat and he sent to summon the inmates of
his Harem and cried to his father-in-law, “Unless thou speak me
sooth concerning thy daughter and her descent and her mother
I”——<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6713" id="noteref-6713" epub:type="noteref">6713</a> He replied, “By Allah, O King of the Age, naught saveth
a man save soothfastness! Her mother indeed was a Gháziyah:
in past time a party of the tribe was passing by my abode when
a young maid strayed from her fellows and was lost. They asked
no questions concerning her; so I lodged her and bred her in my
homestead till she grew up to be a great girl and the fairest of her
time. My heart would not brook her wiving with any other; so I
wedded her and she bare me this daughter whom thou, O King,
hast espoused.” When the Sultan heard these words the flame in
his heart was quenched<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6714" id="noteref-6714" epub:type="noteref">6714</a> and he wondered at the subtlety of the
Sharper man; so he summoned him and asked him saying, “O
wily one, tell me what certified to thee that my Queen had a
dancing girl, a gypsey, to mother?” He answered, “O King of
the Age, verily the Ghaziyah race hath eye-balls intensely black
and bushy brows whereas other women than the Ghaziyah have
the reverse of this.” On such wise the King was convinced of the
man’s skill and he cried, “Ration him with a dish of roast meat
and two scones.” They did as he bade and the three Sharpers
tarried with the Sultan a long time till one day when the King
said to himself, “Verily these three men have by their skill solved
every question of genealogy which I proposed to them: first the
jeweller proved his perfect knowledge of gems; secondly the
genealogist of the horse-kind showed himself as skilful, and the
same was the case with the genealogist of mankind, for he discovered
the origin of my Queen and the truth of his words
appeared from all quarters. Now ’tis my desire that he do the
same with me that I also may know my provenance.” Accordingly
they set the man between his hands and he said to him, “O
fellow, hast thou the power to tell me mine origin?” Said the
Sharper, “Yes, O my lord, I can trace thy descent, but I will so do
only upon a condition; to wit, that thou promise me safety<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6715" id="noteref-6715" epub:type="noteref">6715</a> after
what I shall have told thee; for the saw saith, ‘Whilst Sultan
sitteth on throne’ ware his despite, inasmuch as none may be contumacious
when he saith ‘Smite.’” Thereupon the Sultan told
him, “thou hast a promise of immunity, a promise which shall
never be falsed.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent, and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
pledged his word for the safety of the Sharper with the customary
kerchief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6716" id="noteref-6716" epub:type="noteref">6716</a> and the man said, “O King of the Age, whenas I acquaint
thee with thy root and branch, let it be between us twain
lest these present hear us.” “Wherefore O man?” asked the
Sultan, and the Sharper answered, “O my lord, Allah of All-might
hath among His names ‘The Veiler’”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6717" id="noteref-6717" epub:type="noteref">6717</a> wherefore the King bade
his Chamberlains and Eunuchs retire so that none remained in the
place save those two. Then the Sharper came forward and said,
“O my lord, thou art a son of shame and an issue of adultery.”
As soon as the King heard these words his case changed and his
colour waxed wan and his limbs fell loose:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6718" id="noteref-6718" epub:type="noteref">6718</a> he foamed at the
mouth;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6719" id="noteref-6719" epub:type="noteref">6719</a> he lost hearing and sight; he became as one drunken
without wine and he fell fainting to the ground. After a while he
recovered and said to the Sharper, “Now by the truth of Him
who hath set me upon the necks of His servants, an thy words be
veridical and I ascertain their sooth by proof positive, I will
assuredly abdicate my Kingdom and resign my realm to thee,
because none deserveth it save thou and it becometh us least of
all and every. But an I find thy speech lying I will slay thee.” He
replied, “Hearing and obeying;” and the Sovran, rising up without
stay or delay, went inside to his mother with grip on glaive,
and said to her, “By the truth of Him who uplifted the lift above
the earth, an thou answer me not with the whole truth in whatso I
ask thee, I will cut thee to little bits with this blade.” She enquired,
“What dost thou want with me?” and he replied, “Whose
son am I, and what may be my descent?” She rejoined, “Although
falsehood be an excuse, fact and truth are superior and
more saving. Thou art indeed the very son of a cook. The Sultan
that was before thee took me to wife and I cohabited with him a
while of time without my becoming pregnant by him or having
issue; and he would mourn and groan from the core of his heart
for that he had no seed, nor girl nor boy; neither could he enjoy
aught of sweet food or sleep. Now we had about the Palace
many caged birds; and at last, one day of the days, the King
longed to eat somewhat of poultry, so he went into the court and
sent for the Kitchener to slaughter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6720" id="noteref-6720" epub:type="noteref">6720</a> one of the fowls; and the
man applied himself to catching it. At that time I had taken my
first bath after the monthly ailment and quoth I to myself:—If
this case continue with the King he will perish and the Kingdom
pass from us. And the Shaytan tempted me to that which displeased
Allah”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Queen continued:——And
Satan tempted me and made the sin fair in my
sight. So I went up to the Kitchener, attired and adorned as I
was in my finest apparel and I fell a-jesting with him and provoking
him and disporting with him till his passions were excited by
me: so he tumbled me at that very hour, after which he arose and
slaughtered one of the birds and went his ways. Then I bade the
handmaids sprinkle water on the fowl and clean it and cook it;
and they did my bidding. After a while symptoms of pregnancy
declared themselves in me and became evident; and when the
King heard that his Queen was with child, he waxed gladsome and
joyful and gave alms and scattered gifts and bestowed robes upon
his Officers of Estate and others till the day of my delivery and I
bare a babe—which is thyself. Now at that time the Sultan was
hunting and birding and enjoying himself about the gardens all of
his pleasure at the prospect of becoming a father; and when the
bearer of good news went to him and announced the birth of a
man-child he hurried back to me and forthright bade them decorate
the capital and he found the report true; so the city adorned itself
for forty days in honour of its King. Such is my case and my
tale.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6721" id="noteref-6721" epub:type="noteref">6721</a> Thereupon the King went forth from her to the Sharper
and bade him doff his dress and when this had been done he
doffed his own raiment and habited the man in royal gear and
hooded him with the Taylasán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6722" id="noteref-6722" epub:type="noteref">6722</a> and asked him saying, “What
proof hast thou of my being a son of adultery?” The Sharper
answered, “O my lord, my proof was thy bidding our being
rationed, after showing the perfection of our skill, with a dish of
roast meat and two scones of bread; whereby I knew thee to be of
cook’s breed, for the Kings be wont in such case to make presents
of money and valuables, not of meat and bread as thou didst, and
this evidenced thee to be a bastard King.” He replied, “Sooth thou
sayest,” and then robed him with the rest of his robes including the
Kalansuwah or royal head-dress under the hood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6723" id="noteref-6723" epub:type="noteref">6723</a> and seated him
upon the throne of his estate.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it

the Sharper upon the throne of estate and went forth from him
after abandoning all his women to him and assumed the garb of a
Darwaysh who wandereth about the world and formally abdicated
his dominion to his successor. But when the Sharper-king saw
himself in this condition, he reflected and said to himself,
“Summon thy whilome comrades and see whether they recognize
thee or not.” So he caused them be set before him and
conversed with them; then, perceiving that none knew him he
gifted them and sent them to gang their gait. And he ruled his
realm and bade and forbade and gave and took away and was
gracious and generous to each and every of his lieges; so that the
people of that region who were his subjects blessed him and prayed

<p class="c013">He ceased not wayfaring, as become a wanderer, till he came to
Cairo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6725" id="noteref-6725" epub:type="noteref">6725</a> city whose circuit was a march of two and a half days and
which then was ruled by her own King Mohammed hight. He
found the folk in safety and prosperity and good ordinance; and
he solaced himself by strolling about the streets to the right and
left and he diverted his mind by considering the crowds and the
world of men contained in the capital, until he drew near the
palace when suddenly he sighted the Sultan returning from the
chase and from taking his pleasure. Seeing this the Darwaysh
retired to the wayside, and the King happening to glance in that
direction, saw him standing and discerned in him the signs of
former prosperity. So he said to one of his suite, “Take yon man
with thee and entertain him till I send for him.” His bidding
being obeyed he entered the Palace and, when he had rested from
the fatigues of the way, he summoned the Fakír to the presence
and questioned him of his condition, saying, “Thou, from what
land art thou?” He responded, “O my lord, I am a beggar
man;” and the other rejoined, “There is no help but that thou
tell me what brought thee hither.” The Darwaysh retorted, “O
my lord, this may not be save in privacy,” and the other exclaimed,
“Be it so for thee.” The twain then arose and repaired to a
retired room in the Palace and the Fakir recounted to the Sultan
all that had befallen him since the loss of his kingship and also
how he, a Sultan, had given up the throne of his realm and had
made himself a Darwaysh. The Sovran marvelled at his self-denial
in yielding up the royal estate and cried, “Laud be to Him
who degradeth and upraiseth, who honoureth and humbleth by
the wise ordinance of His All-might,” presently adding, “O
Darwaysh, I have passed through an adventure which is marvellous;
indeed ’tis one of the Wonders of the World<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6726" id="noteref-6726" epub:type="noteref">6726</a> which I
needs must relate to thee nor from thee withhold aught thereof.”
And he fell to telling——. And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And

<h3 class="c012"><em>THE HISTORY OF MOHAMMED, SULTAN OF CAIRO.</em></h3>

<p class="c013">I began my career in the world as a Darwaysh, an asker, owning
naught of the comforts and conveniences of life, till at length, one
day of the days, I became possessor of just ten silverlings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6727" id="noteref-6727" epub:type="noteref">6727</a> (and
no more) which I resolved to expend upon myself. Accordingly
I walked into the Bazar purposing to purchase somewhat of provaunt.
While I was looking around, I espied a man passing by
and leading in an iron chain a dog-faced baboon and crying
“Haráj!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6728" id="noteref-6728" epub:type="noteref">6728</a> this ape is for sale at the price of ten faddahs.” The
folk jibed at the man and jeered at his ape; but quoth I to myself,
“Buy this beast and expend upon it the ten silverlings.” Accordingly
I drew near the seller and said to him, “Take these ten
faddahs;” whereupon he took them and gave me the ape which I
led to the cell wherein I dwelt. Then I opened the door and went
in with my bargain but began debating in my mind what to do
and said, “How shall I manage a meal for the baboon and
myself?” While I was considering behold, the beast was suddenly
transformed, and became a young man fair of favour who had no
equal in loveliness and stature and symmetric grace, perfect as the
moon at full on the fourteenth night; and he addressed me saying,
“O Shaykh Mohammed, thou hast bought me with ten faddahs,
being all thou hadst and art debating how we shall feed, I and
thou.” Quoth I, “What art thou?” and quoth he, “Query me no
questions, concerning whatso thou shalt see, for good luck hath
come to thee.” Then he gave me an Ashrafi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6729" id="noteref-6729" epub:type="noteref">6729</a> and said, “Take
this piece of gold and fare thee forth to the Bazar and get us
somewhat to eat and drink.” I took it from him and repairing to
the market purchased whatso food our case required; then returning
to the cell set the victual before him and seated myself by his side.
So we ate our sufficiency and passed that night, I and he, in the
cell, and, when Allah caused the morn to dawn, he said to me, “O
man, this room is not suitable to us: hie thee and hire a larger
lodging.” I replied, “To hear is to obey;” and, rising without
stay or delay, went and took a room more roomy in the upper part
of the Wakálah.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6730" id="noteref-6730" epub:type="noteref">6730</a> Thither we removed, I and the youth, and
presently he gave me ten dinars more and said, “Go to the Bazar
and buy thee furniture as much as is wanted.” Accordingly, I
went forth and bought what he ordered and on my return I found
before him a bundle containing a suit of clothes suitable for the
Kings. These he gave to me desiring that I hie me to the
Hammam and don them after bathing, so I did his bidding and
washed and dressed myself and found in each pocket of the many
pockets an hundred gold pieces; and presently when I had donned
the dress I said to myself, “Am I dreaming or wide awake?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6731" id="noteref-6731" epub:type="noteref">6731</a>
Then I returned to the youth in the room and when he saw me he
rose to his feet and commended my figure and seated me beside
him. Presently he brought up a bigger bundle and bade me take
it and repair to the Sultan of the City and at the same time ask
his daughter in marriage for myself.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan of
Cairo continued:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6732" id="noteref-6732" epub:type="noteref">6732</a>—So I took it and repaired with it to the King
of that city, and a slave whom the youth had bought bore the
bundle. Now when I approached the Palace I found thereabout
the Chamberlains and Eunuchs and Lords of the Land: so I drew
near them and when they saw me in that suit they approved my
appearance and questioned me saying, “What be thy business
and what dost thou require?” I replied, “My wish is to have
audience of the King,” and they rejoined, “Wait a little while till
we obtain for thee his permission.” Then one of the ushers went
in and reported the matter to the Sultan who gave orders to
admit me; so the man came out and led me within and on entering
the presence I salamed to the Sovran and wished him welfare and
presently set before him the bundle, saying, “O King of the Age,
this be in the way of a gift which befitteth my station not thine
estate.” The Sultan bade the package be spread out, and he
looked into it and saw a suit of royal apparel whose like he never
had owned. So he was astonished at the sight and said in his
mind, “By Allah, I possess naught like this, nor was I ever master
of so magnificent a garment;” presently adding, “It shall be
accepted, O Shaykh, but needs must thou have some want or
requisition from me.” I replied, “O King of the Age, my wish is
to become thy connection through that lady concealed and pearl
unrevealed, thy daughter.” When the Sultan heard these words,
he turned to his Wazir and said, “Counsel me as to what I should
do in the matter of this man?” Said he, “O King of the Age,
show him thy most precious stone and say him:—An thou have a
jewel evening this one it shall be my daughter’s marriage-dowry.”
The King did as he was advised, whereat I was wild with wonderment
and asked him, “An I bring thee such a gem wilt thou give
me the Princess?” He answered, “Yea, verily!” and I took my
leave bearing with me the jewel to the young man who was awaiting
me in the room.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6733" id="noteref-6733" epub:type="noteref">6733</a> He enquired of me, “Hast thou proposed
for the Princess?” and I replied, “Yes: I have spoken with the
Sultan concerning her, when he brought out this stone, saying to
me:—An thou have a jewel evening this one, it shall be my
daughter’s marriage-dowry; nor hath the Sultan power to false
his word.” The youth rejoined, “This day I can do naught, but
to-morrow (Inshallah!) I will bring thee ten jewels like it and
these thou shalt carry and present to the Sovran.” Accordingly
when the morning dawned he arose and fared forth and after an
hour or so he returned with ten gems which he gave me. I took
them and repaired with them to the Sultan and, entering the
presence, I presented to him all the ten. When he looked upon
the precious stones he wondered at their brilliant water and turning
to the Wazir again asked him how he should act in this matter.
Replied the Minister, “O King of the Age, thou requiredst of him
but one jewel and he hath brought thee ten; ’tis therefore only
right and fair to give him thy daughter.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!”

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Minister
said to the Monarch, “Give him thy daughter.” Accordingly the
Sultan summoned the Kazis and the Efendis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6734" id="noteref-6734" epub:type="noteref">6734</a> who wrote out the
marriage-contract between me and the Princess. Then I returned
to the youth who had remained in the room and told him all that
had occurred when he said, “’Twere best to conclude the wedding-ceremony
and pay the first visit to thy bride at once; but thou
shalt on no wise consummate the nuptials until I bid thee go in
unto her, after somewhat shall have been done by me.” “Hearing
and obeying,” replied I; and, when the night of going in<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6735" id="noteref-6735" epub:type="noteref">6735</a> came,
I visited the Sultan’s daughter but sat apart from her by the side
of the room during the first night and the second and the third;
nor did I approach her although every day her mother came and
asked her the usual question<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6736" id="noteref-6736" epub:type="noteref">6736</a> and she answered, “He hath never
approached me.” So she grieved with sore grief for that ’tis the
wont of womankind, when a maid is married and her groom goeth
not in unto her, to deem that haply folk will attribute it to some
matter which is not wholly right. After the third night the
mother reported the case to her father who cried, “This night
except he abate her pucelage I will slay him!” The tidings
reached my bride who told all to me, so I repaired to the young
man and acquainted him therewith. He cried, “When thou shalt
visit her say:—By Allah, I will not enjoy thee unless thou give
me the amulet-bracelet hanging to thy right shoulder.” I replied,
“To hear is to obey;” and, when I went in to her at nightfall, I
asked her, “Dost thou really desire me to futter thee?” She
answered, “I do indeed;” so I rejoined, “Then give me the
amulet-bracelet hanging over thy right shoulder.” She arose
forthright and unbound it and gave it to me, whereupon I bled
her of the hymeneal blood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6737" id="noteref-6737" epub:type="noteref">6737</a> and going to the young man gave him
the jewel. Then I returned to my bride and slept by her side till
the morning when I awoke and found myself lying outstretched
in my own caravanserai-cell. I was wonderstruck and asked
myself, “Am I on wake or in a dream?” and I saw my whilome
garments, the patched gabardine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6738" id="noteref-6738" epub:type="noteref">6738</a> and tattered shirt along with
my little drum;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6739" id="noteref-6739" epub:type="noteref">6739</a> but the fine suit given to me by the youth was
not on my body nor did I espy any sign of it anywhere. So with
fire burning in my heart after what had befallen me, I wandered
about crowded sites and lone spots and in my distraction I knew
not what to do, whither to go or whence to come; when lo and
behold! I found sitting in an unfrequented part of the street a
Maghrabi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6740" id="noteref-6740" epub:type="noteref">6740</a> a Barbary man, who had before him some written
leaves and was casting omens for sundry bystanders. Seeing this
state of things, I came forward and drew near him and made him a
salam which he returned; then, after considering my features
straitly, he exclaimed, “O Shaykh, hath that Accursed done it
and torn thee from thy bride?” “Yes,” I replied. Hereupon he
said to me, “Wait a little while,” and seated me beside him; then,
as soon as the crowd dispersed he said, “O Shaykh, the baboon
which thou boughtest for ten silver bits and which was presently
transformed into a young man of Adam’s sons, is not a human of
the sons of Adam but a Jinni who is enamoured of the Princess
thou didst wed.” However, he could not approach her by reason
of the charmed bracelet hanging from her right shoulder, wherefore
he served thee this sleight and won it and now he still weareth
it. But I will soon work his destruction to the end that Jinn-kind
and mankind may be at rest from his mischief; for he is one of
the rebellious and misbegotten imps who break the law of our lord
Solomon (upon whom be the Peace!). Presently the Maghrabi
took a leaf and wrote upon it as it were a book.——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and

love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Maghrabi wrote a writ and signed his name within and sealed it;
after which he handed it to me saying, “O Shaykh, take this missive
and hie thee herewith to a certain spot where thou must wait and
observe those who pass by. Hearten thy heart and when thou
shalt see approaching thee a man attended by a numerous train,
present to him this scroll for ’tis he who will win for thee thy wish.”
I took the note from the Barbary man and fared forth to the
place which he had described and ceased not faring till I reached
it after travelling all that night and half the next day; then I sat
down until darkness set in to await whatso might befal me. When
a fourth part of the night had passed, a dazzling glare of lights
suddenly appeared from afar advancing towards me; and as it
shone nearer, I made out men bearing flambeaux<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6741" id="noteref-6741" epub:type="noteref">6741</a> and lanthorns,
also a train of attendants befitting the Kings. They looked on
and considered me whilst my heart fluttered with fear, and I was
in sore affright. But the procession defiled and drew off from before
me, marching two after two, and presently appeared the chief
cortège wherein was a Sultan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6742" id="noteref-6742" epub:type="noteref">6742</a> of the Jánn. As he neared
me I heartened my heart and advanced and presented to him the
letter which he, having halted, opened and read aloud; and it
was:——“Be it known to thee, O Sultan of the Jann, that the
bearer of this our epistle hath a need which thou must grant him
by destroying his foe; and if opposition be offered by any we will
do the opponent die. An thou fail to relieve him thou wilt know
to seek from me relief for thyself.” When the King of the Jann
had read the writ and had mastered its meaning and its mysteries,
he forthwith called out to one of his serjeants<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6743" id="noteref-6743" epub:type="noteref">6743</a> who at once came
forward and bade him bring into his presence without delay such-and-such
a Jinni who by his spells had wrought round the daughter
of the Cairene Sultan. The messenger replied, “Hearing and
obeying,” and departed from him and disappearing was absent
an hour or thereabouts; after which he and others returned with
the Jinni and set him standing before the King who exclaimed,
“Wherefore, O Accurst, hast thou wrought ill to this man and
done on this wise and on that wise?” He replied, “O my lord,
all came of my fondness for the Princess who wore a charm in her
armlet which hindered my approaching her and therefore I made
use of this man to effect my purpose. I became master of the
talisman and won my wish but I love the maiden and never will
I harm her.” Now when the Sultan heard these words he said,
“Thy case can be after one of two fashions only. Either return
the armlet that the man may be reunited with his wife and she
with her husband as whilome they were; or contrary me and I
will command the headsman strike thy neck.” Now when the
Jinni heard this speech (and ’twas he who had assumed the
semblance of a dog-faced baboon), he refused and was rebellious
to the King and cried, “I will not return the armlet nor will I
release the damsel, for none can possess her save myself.” And
having spoken in this way he attempted to flee.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Márid
would fain have fled from before the King of the Jann, but the
Sovran bade other Marids and more forceful arrest him; so they
seized him and pinioned him and bound him in chains and collar
and dragged him behind the King of the Jann till the latter had
reached his place and had summoned him and had taken from
him the armlet. Then the Sultan gave order for him to be slain
and they slew him. When this was done, I prayed for the charm-armlet
and I recovered it after the Marid’s death; they also
restored to me my fine suit. So I proceeded to the city which
I entered, and as soon as the guards and courtiers saw me, they
cried out for joy and said, “This is the son-in-law of the Sultan
who was lost! Hereat all the lieges hurried up to me and
received me with high respect and greeted me. But after entering
the Palace I proceeded forthright till I reached the apartment
set apart by them for myself and my spouse whom I found in a
deep sleep and stupefied, as it were; a condition in which she
had lain ever since I took from her the talismanic armlet. So
I replaced the jewel upon her right shoulder and she awoke
and arose and ordered herself; whereat her father and family
and the Lords of the Land and all the folk joyed with exceeding
joy. After this we lived together in all happiness till the death
of her sire who, having no son, named me his successor so that
I became what I am.” Now when the Darwaysh-Sultan heard
all this he was astounded at what happeneth in this world of
marvels and miracles; upon which I said to him, “O my brother,
wonder not; for whatso is predetermined shall perforce be carried
out. But thou needs must become my Wazir; because thou art
experienced in rule and governance and, since what time my sire-in-law
the Sultan died, I have been perplexed in my plight being
unable to find me a Minister who can administer the monarchy.
So do thou become my Chief Counsellor in the realm.” Thereupon
the Darwaysh replied, “Hearkening and obedience.” The
Sultan then robed him in a sumptuous robe of honour and committed
to him his seal-ring and all other matters pertinent to
his office, at the same time setting apart for him a palace, spacious
of corners, which he furnished with splendid furniture and wadded
carpets and <i><span xml:lang="fr">vaisselle</span></i> and other such matters. So the Wazir took
his seat of office and held a Divan or Council of State forthright
and commanded and countermanded, and bade and forbade
according as he saw just and equitable; and his fame for equity
and justice was dispread abroad; insomuch that whoever had
a cause or request or other business he would come to the Wazir
for ordering whatso he deemed advisable. In this condition he
continued for many years till, on a day of the days, the Sultan’s
mind was depressed. Upon this he sent after the Minister who
attended at his bidding, when he said, “O Wazir, my heart is
heavy!” “Enter then,” replied the Minister, “O King, into
thy treasury of jewels and rubies and turn them over in thy
hands and thy breast will be broadened.” The Sultan did accordingly
but it took no effect upon his ennui; so he said, “O Wazir,
I cannot win free of this melancholic humour and nothing
pleasureth me in my palace; so let us fare forth, I and thou,
in disguise.” “Hearing is obeying,” quoth the Minister. The
twain then retired into a private chamber to shift their garb and
habited themselves as Darwayshes, the Darwayshes of Ajam-land,
and went forth and passed through the city right and left till
they reached a Máristán, a hospital for lunatics.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6744" id="noteref-6744" epub:type="noteref">6744</a> Here they
found two young men, one reading the Koran<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6745" id="noteref-6745" epub:type="noteref">6745</a> and the other
hearkening to him, both being in chains like men Jinn-mad; and
the Sultan said in his mind, “By Allah, this is a marvel-case,”
and bespake the men asking, “Are ye really insane?” They
answered saying, “No, by Allah; we are not daft but so admirable
are our adventures that were they graven with needle-gravers
upon the eye-corners they had been warners to whoso would be
warned.” “What are they?” quoth the King, and quoth they,
“Each of us, by Allah, hath his own story;” and presently he
who had been reading exclaimed, “O King of the Age, hear
my tale.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine,
and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where
is this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was

<h3 class="c012"><em>THE STORY OF THE FIRST LUNATIC.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6746" id="noteref-6746" epub:type="noteref">6746</a></h3>

<p class="c013">I was a merchant and kept a shop wherein were Hindi goods of
all kinds and colours, highmost priced articles; and I sold and
bought with much profit. I continued in this condition a while
of time till one day of the days as I, according to my custom, was
sitting in my shop an old woman came up and gave me the good
morning and greeted me with the salam. I returned her salute
when she seated her upon the shopboard and asked me saying,
“O master, hast thou any pieces of choice Indian stuffs?” I
replied, “O my mistress, I have with me whatso thou wantest;”
and she rejoined, “Bring me forth one of them.” Accordingly
I arose and fetched her a Hindi piece of the costliest price and
placed it in her hands. She took it and examining it was greatly
pleased by its beauty and presently said to me, “O my lord, for
how much is this?” Said I, “Five hundred dinars;” whereupon
she pulled forth her purse and counted out to me the five
hundred gold pieces. Then she took the stuff and went her ways;
and I, O our lord the Sultan, had sold to her for five hundred
sequins a piece of cloth worth at cost price three hundred and
fifty gold pieces. She came to me again, O my lord, on the next
day and asked me for another piece; so I rose up and brought
her the bundle and she paid me once more five hundred dinars:
then she took up her bargain and ganged her gait. She did the
same, O my lord, on the third and the fourth day and so on
to the fifteenth, taking a piece of stuff from me and paying me
regularly five hundred golden pieces for each bargain. On the
sixteenth behold, she entered my shop as was her wont, but she
found not her purse; so she said to me, “O Khwájah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6747" id="noteref-6747" epub:type="noteref">6747</a> I have
left my purse at home.” Said I, “O my lady, an thou return ’tis
well and if not thou art welcome to it.” She sware she would
not take it and I, on the other hand, sware her to carry it off as a
token of love and friendship.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6748" id="noteref-6748" epub:type="noteref">6748</a> Thereupon debate fell between us,
and I, O our lord the Sultan, had made muchel of money by her
and, had she taken two pieces gratis, I would not have asked
questions anent them. At last she cried, “O Khwajah, I have
sworn an oath and thou hast sworn an oath, and we shall never
agree except thou favour me by accompanying me to my house
so thou mayest receive the value of the stuff, when neither of us
will have been forsworn: therefore lock up thy shop lest anything
be lost in thine absence.” Accordingly I bolted my door and went
with her, O our lord the Sultan, and we ceased not walking,
conversing the while we walked, I and she, until we neared her
abode when she pulled out a kerchief from her girdle and said,
“’Tis my desire to bind this over thine eyes.” Quoth I, “For
what cause?” and quoth she, “For that on our way be sundry
houses whose doors are open and the women are sitting in the
vestibules of their homes, so that haply thy glance may alight upon
some one of them, married or maid, and thy heart become
engaged in a love-affair and thou abide distraught, because in
this quarter of the town be many fair faces, wives and virgins,
who would fascinate even a religious, and therefore we are alarmed
for thy peace of mind.” Upon this I said in myself, “By Allah,
this old woman is able of advice;” and I consented to her
requirement, when she bound the kerchief over my eyes and
blindfolded me. Then we walked on till we came to the house
she sought; and when she rapped with the door-ring a slave-girl
came out and opening the door let us in. The old body then
approached me and unbound the kerchief from over my eyes;
whereupon I looked around me, holding myself to be a captive,
and I found me in a mansion having sundry separate apartments
in the wings and ’twas richly decorated resembling the palaces
of the Kings.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where
is this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth pursued:——By
Allah, O our lord the Sultan, of that house I never saw the
fellow. She then bade me hide within a room and I did her
bidding in a corner place where beside me I beheld heaped together
and cast down in that private site all the pieces of stuff which the
ancient dame had purchased of me. Seeing this I marvelled in
my mind and lo! appeared two damsels as they were moons and
came down from an upper story till they stood on the ground-floor;
after which they cut a piece of cloth into twain and each maiden
took one and tucked up her sleeves. They then sprinkled the
court of that palace with water of the rose and of the orange-flower,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6749" id="noteref-6749" epub:type="noteref">6749</a>
wiping the surface with the cloth and rubbing it till it
became as silver; after which the two girls retired into an inner
room and brought out some fifty chairs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6750" id="noteref-6750" epub:type="noteref">6750</a> which they set down, and
placed over each seat a rug<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6751" id="noteref-6751" epub:type="noteref">6751</a> with cushions of brocade. They then
carried in a larger chair of gold and placed upon it a carpet with
cushions of orfrayed work and after a time they withdrew.
Presently, there descended from the staircase, two following two, a
host of maidens in number till they evened the chairs and each one
of them sat down upon her own, and at last suddenly appeared a
young lady in whose service were ten damsels, and she walked up
to and they seated her upon the great chair. When I beheld her,
O my lord the Sultan, my right senses left me and my wits fled
me and I was astounded at her loveliness and her stature and her
symmetric grace as she swayed to and fro in her pride of beauty and
gladsome spirits amongst those damsels and laughed and sported
with them. At last she cried aloud, “O mother mine!” when the
ancient dame answered her call and she asked her, “Hast thou
brought the young man?” The old woman replied, “Yes, he is
present between thy hands;” and the fair lady said, “Bring him
hither to me!” But when I heard these words I said to myself,
“There is no Majesty and there is no Might, save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great! Doubtless when this damsel shall have discovered
my being in such hiding place she will bid them do me
die.” The old woman then came forwards to me and led me before
the young lady seated on the great chair; and, when I stood in
her presence, she smiled in my face and saluted me with the salam
and welcomed me; after which she signed for a seat to be brought
and when her bidding was obeyed set it close beside her own.
She then commanded me to sit and I seated me by her side.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared

    <div>The Three Hundred and Fiftieth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
pursued:——She seated me beside her, O our lord the Sultan, and
fell to talking and joking with me for an hour or so when she said,
“O youth, what sayest thou of me and of my beauty and my loveliness?
Would Heaven that I could occupy thy thought and
please thee so that I might become to thee wife and thou be to me
man.” When I heard these her words I replied, “O my lady,
how dare I presume to attain such honour? Indeed I do not
deem myself worthy to become a slave between thy hands.”
Hereupon said she, “Nay, O young man, my words have in them
nor evasion nor alteration; so be not disheartened or fearful of
returning me a reply, for that my heart is fulfilled of thy love.”
I now understood, O our lord the Sultan, that the damsel was
desirous of marrying me; but I could not conceive what was the
cause thereof or who could have given her intelligence concerning
me. She continued to enjoy herself in the gladsomest way till at
length I was emboldened to say to her, “O my lady, an thy words
to me be after the fashion of thy will, remember the proverb:—When
a kindness is to be done, this is its time.” “By Allah, O
youth, there cannot be a more fortunate day than this present.”
“O my lady, what shall I apportion to thee for dowry?” “The
dowry hath been paid to me in the value of the stuffs which thou
entrustedst to this ancient dame who is my mother!” “That
cannot suffice.” “By Allah, naught shall be added; but, O youth,
’tis my intention forthright to send after the Kazi and his Assessors
and I will choose me a trustee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6752" id="noteref-6752" epub:type="noteref">6752</a> that they may tie together us
twain without delay; and thou shalt come in to me this coming
evening. But all such things be upon one condition.” “And
what may be thy condition?” “This, that thou swear never to
address or to draw near any woman save myself.” And I, O our
lord the Sultan, being unmarried and eager to possess so beautiful
a bride, said to her, “This be thine; and I will never contrary thee
by word or by deed.” She then sent to summon the Kazi and
his witnesses and appointed an agent; upon which they knotted
the knot. After the marriage ceremony was ended she ordered
coffee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6753" id="noteref-6753" epub:type="noteref">6753</a> and sherbets and gave somewhat of dirhams to the Kazi
and a robe of honour to her trustee; and this done, all went their
several ways. I was lost in astonishment and said in my mind,
“Do I dream or am I on wake?” She then commanded her
damsels to clear the Hammam-bath and cleanse it and fill it
afresh and get ready towels and waist-cloths and silken napkins<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6754" id="noteref-6754" epub:type="noteref">6754</a>
and scented woods and essences, as virgin ambergris and ottars
and perfumes of vari-coloured hues and kinds. And when they
had executed her orders, she ordered the Eunuchry standing in her
service to take me and bear me to the Bath, largessing each one
with a sumptuous dress. They led me into a Hammam which had
been made private and I saw a place tongue is powerless to portray.
And as we arrived there they spread vari-coloured carpets upon
which I sat me down and doffed what clothing was upon me: then
I entered the hot rooms and smelt delicious scents diffused from
the sides of the hall, sandal-wood, Comorin lign-aloes and other
such fragrant substances. Here they came up to me and seated
me, lathering me with perfumed soaps and shampoo’d me till my
body became silver-bright; when they fetched the metal tasses and
I washed with water luke-warm after which they brought me cold
water mingled with rose water and I sprinkled it over me. After
this they supplied me with silken napkins and drying-towels of
palm-fibre<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6755" id="noteref-6755" epub:type="noteref">6755</a> wherewith I rubbed me and then repaired to the cool
room outside the calidarium<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6756" id="noteref-6756" epub:type="noteref">6756</a> where I found a royal dress. The
Eunuchry arrayed me therein and after fumigating me with the
smoke of lign-aloes served up somewhat of confections<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6757" id="noteref-6757" epub:type="noteref">6757</a> and coffee
and sherbets of sundry sorts; so I drank after eating the Ma’jún.
About eventide I left the Baths with all the Eunuchry in attendance
on me and we walked till we entered the Palace and they led me
into a closet spread with kingly carpets and cushions. And behold,
she came up to me attired in a new habit more sumptuous than
that I had seen her wearing erewhile.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
continued:——And I, O our lord the Sultan, went into the closet
and behold, she met me wearing a habit of the most sumptuous:
so when I sighted her she seemed to me from the richness of her
ornaments like an enchanted hoard wherefrom the talisman had
been newly removed. She sat down beside me and bent lovingly
over me and I rose up for I could no longer contain my passion
and wrought that work which was to be worked.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6758" id="noteref-6758" epub:type="noteref">6758</a> Presently she
again disappeared but soon returned in vestments even richer than
the last and she did with me as before and I embraced her once
more. In short, O our lord the Sultan, we ceased not dwelling
together, I and she, in joyaunce and enjoyment, laughter and
disport and delicious converse for a space of twenty days. At the
end of this time I called to mind my lady-mother, and said to the
dame I had espoused, “O my lady, ’tis long since I have been
absent from home and ’tis long since my parent hath seen me or
wotteth aught concerning me: needs must she be pining and
grieving for my sake. So do thou give me leave to visit her and
look after my mother and also after my shop.” Quoth she, “No
harm in that: thou mayst visit thy mother daily and busy thyself
about thy shop-business; but this ancient dame (my mother) is
she who must lead thee out and bring thee back.” Whereto I
replied, “’Tis well.” Upon this the old woman came in and tied
a kerchief over my eyes according to custom and fared forth
with me till we reached the spot where she had been wont to
remove the bandage. Here she unbound it saying, “We will
expect thee to-morrow about noontide and when thou comest
to this place, thou shalt see me awaiting thee.” I left her and
repaired to my mother whom I found grieving and weeping at
my absence; and upon seeing me she rose up and threw her
arms round my neck with tears of joy. I said, “Weep not, O my
mother, for the cause of my absence hath been a certain matter
which be thus and thus.” I then related to her my adventure and
she on hearing it was rejoiced thereby and exclaimed, “O my son,
may Allah give thee gladness; but I pray thee solace me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6759" id="noteref-6759" epub:type="noteref">6759</a> at least
every two days with a visit that my longing for thee may be
satisfied.” I replied, “This shall be done;” and thenceforth, O
our lord the Sultan, I went to my shop and busied myself as was
my wont till noontide, when I returned to the place appointed
and found the old woman awaiting me. Nor did I ever fare forth
from the mansion without her binding my eyes with the kerchief
which she loosed only when we reached my own house; and
whenever I asked her of this she would answer, “On our way be
sundry houses whose doors are open and the women sitting in the
vestibules of their homes, so that haply thy glance may alight
upon some one of them, matron or maid: all sniff up love like
water,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6760" id="noteref-6760" epub:type="noteref">6760</a> and we fear for thee lest thy heart be netted in the net
of amours.” For thirty days, a whole month, I continued to go
and come after this fashion but, O our lord the Sultan, at all
times and tides I was drowned in thought and wondered in my
mind, saying, “What chance caused me forgather with this
damsel? What made me marry her? Whence this wealth which
is under her hand? How came I to win union with her?” For
I knew not the cause of all this. Now, on a day of the days, I
found an opportunity of being private with one of her black slave
girls<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6761" id="noteref-6761" epub:type="noteref">6761</a> and questioned her of all these matters that concerned her
mistress. She replied, “O my lord, the history of my lady is
marvellous; but I dare not relate it to thee in fear lest she hear
thereof and do me die.” So I said to her, “By Allah, O handmaid
of good, an thou wilt say me sooth I will veil it darkly for in
the keeping of secrets there is none like myself: nor will I reveal it
at any time.” Then I took oath of secrecy when she said, “O
my lord,”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this

watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
continued:——Then the handmaiden said to me, “O my lord, my
lady went forth one day of the days to the Hammam with the
object of pleasuring and of diverting herself, for which purpose she
made goodly preparation including gifts and presents,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6762" id="noteref-6762" epub:type="noteref">6762</a> matters
worth a mint of money.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6763" id="noteref-6763" epub:type="noteref">6763</a> After leaving the baths she set out
upon an excursion to eat the noon-day meal in a flower garden
where she enjoyed herself with exceeding joy and enjoyment,
eating and drinking till the evening; and when she designed to
depart she collected the fragments of the feast and distributed
them amongst the mean and the mesquin. On her return she
passed through the Bazar-street wherein standeth thy shop, and
it was a Friday when thou wast sitting, adorned with thy finest
dress, in converse with the nearest neighbour. And suddenly as
she fared by, she beheld thee in such state and her heart was
stricken with sore stroke of love albeit none of us observed her
condition and what affection she had conceived for thee. However,
no sooner had she reached her palace than her melancholy
began to grow upon her with groans and her cark and care, and
her colour left her: she ate and drank little and less and her sleep
forsook her and her frame was sorely enfeebled till at last she took
to her bed. Upon this her mother went to summon a learned
man<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6764" id="noteref-6764" epub:type="noteref">6764</a> or a mediciner that he might consider the condition of her
daughter and what sickness had gotten about her: she was absent
for an hour and returned with an ancient dame who took seat
beside her and putting forth her hand felt the patient’s pulse.
But she could perceive in her no bodily ailment or pain, upon
which the old woman understood her case, but she durst not
bespeak her of it or mention to her mother that the girl’s heart
was distraught by love. So she said, There is no harm to thee!
and (Inshallah!) to-morrow I will return hither to thee and bring
with me a certain medicine. She then went forth from us and
leading the mother to a place apart, said to her, O my lady, Allah
upon thee, pardon me for whatso I shall mention and be thou convinced
that my words are true and keep them secret nor divulge
them to any. The other replied, Say on and fear not for aught
which hath become manifest to thee of my daughter’s unweal:
haply Allah will vouchsafe welfare. She rejoined, Verily, thy
daughter hath no bodily disorder or malady of the disease kind
but she is in love and there can be no cure for her save union with
her beloved. Quoth the mother, And how about the coming of
her sweetheart? This is a matter which may not be managed
except thou show us some contrivance whereby to bring this youth
hither and marry him to her. But contrivance is with Allah.
Then the old lady went her ways forthright and the girl’s mother
sought her daughter and said to her after kindly fashion, O my
child, as for thee thy disorder is a secret and not a bodily disease.
Tell me of him thou requirest and fear naught from me; belike
Allah will open to us the gate of contrivance whereby thou shalt
win to thy wish. Now when the maiden heard these words she
was abashed before her parent and kept silence, being ashamed to
speak; nor would she return any reply for the space of twenty
days. But during this term her distraction increased and her
mother ceased not to repeat the same words, time after time, till it
became manifest to the parent that the daughter was madly in
love with a young man; so at last quoth she, Describe him to me.
Quoth the other, O mother mine, indeed he is young of years and
fair of favour; also he woneth in such a Bazar, methinks on its
southern side. Therewith the dame arose without stay or delay
and fared forth to find the young man and ’tis thyself, O youth!
And when the mother saw thee she took from thee a piece of cloth
and brought it to her daughter and promised thou shouldst visit
her. Thenceforwards she ceased not repeating her calls to thee for
the period thou wottest well until by her cunning she brought thee
hither; and that happened which happened and thou didst take the
daughter to wife. Such is her tale and beware lest thou reveal
my disclosure.” “No, by Allah,” replied I. Then the lunatic
resumed speaking to the Sultan:——O my lord, I continued to
cohabit with her for the space of one month, going daily to see my
mother and to sell in my shop and I returned to my wife every
evening blindfolded and guided as usual by my mother-in-law.
Now one day of the days as I was sitting at my business, a damsel
came into the Bazar-street——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,

and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
continued:——A damsel came into the Bazar-street bearing the
image of a cock made of precious ore and crusted with pearls and
rubies and other gems; and she offered it to the goodmen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6765" id="noteref-6765" epub:type="noteref">6765</a> of the
market for sale. So they opened the biddings at five hundred
dinars and they ceased not contending<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6766" id="noteref-6766" epub:type="noteref">6766</a> thereanent till the price
went up to nine hundred and fifty gold pieces. All this time and
I looked on nor did I interfere by speaking a syllable or by adding
to the biddings a single bit of gold. At last, when none would
offer aught more, the girl came up to me and said, “O my lord,
all the gentlemen have increased their biddings for the cock; but
thou hast neither bidden nor heartened my heart by one kind
word.” Quoth I, “I have no need thereof;” and quoth she, “By
Allah, needs must thou bid somewhat more than the others.” I
replied, “Since there is no help for it, I will add fifty dinars which
will fill up the thousand.” She rejoined, “Allah gar thee gain?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6767" id="noteref-6767" epub:type="noteref">6767</a>
So I fared into my shop to fetch the money, saying in my mind,
“I will present this curiosity to my Harím: haply ’twill pleasure
her.” But when I was about, O my lord the Sultan, to count out
the thousand ducats, the damsel would not accept aught of me but
said, “I have a request to make of thee, O youth! to wit, that I
may take one kiss from thy cheek.” I asked her, “For what purpose?”
and she answered, “I want one kiss of thy cheek which
shall be the price of my cock, for I need of thee naught else.” I
thought to myself, “By Allah, a single kiss of my cheek for the
value of a thousand sequins were an easy price;” and I gave my
consent thereto, O my lord. Then she came up to me and leaned
over me and bussed my cheek, but after the kiss she bit me with a
bite which left its mark:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6768" id="noteref-6768" epub:type="noteref">6768</a> then she gave me the cock and went her
ways in haste. Now when it was noon I made for my wife’s house
and came upon the old woman awaiting me at the customed stead
and she bound the kerchief over my eyes and after blindfolding
them fared with me till we reached our home when she unbound
it. I found my wife sitting in the saloon dressed from head to foot
in cramoisy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6769" id="noteref-6769" epub:type="noteref">6769</a> and with an ireful face, whereupon I said to myself,
“O Saviour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6770" id="noteref-6770" epub:type="noteref">6770</a> save me!” I then went up to her and took out the
cock which was covered with pearls and rubies, thinking that her
evil humour would vanish at the sight of it and said, “O my
lady, accept this cock for ’tis curious and admirable to look upon;
and I bought it to pleasure thee.” She put forth her hand and
taking it from me examined it by turning it rightwards and leftwards;
then exclaimed, “Didst thou in very sooth buy this on my
account?” Replied I, “By Allah, O my lady, I bought it for
thee at a thousand gold pieces.” Hereupon she shook her head at
me, O my lord the Sultan, and cried out after a long look at my
face, “What meaneth that bite on thy cheek?” Then with a loud
and angry voice she called to her women who came down the stairs
forthright bearing the body of a young girl with the head cut off
and set upon the middle of the corpse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6771" id="noteref-6771" epub:type="noteref">6771</a> and I looked and behold,
it was the head of the damsel who had sold me the cock for a kiss
and who had bitten my cheek. Now my wife had sent her with
the toy by way of trick, saying to her, “Let us try this youth
whom I have wedded and see if he hold himself bound by his
plighted word and pact or if he be false and foul.” But of all
this I knew naught. Then she cried a second cry and behold, up
came three handmaids bearing with them three cocks like that
which I had brought for her and she said, “Thou bringest me this
one cock when I have these three cocks; but inasmuch as, O
youth, thou hast broken the covenant that was between me and
thee, I want thee no more: go forth! wend thy ways forthright!”
And she raged at me and cried to her mother, “Take him away!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6772" id="noteref-6772" epub:type="noteref">6772</a>——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night, an the Sovran
suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Youth
continued to the King:——Hereupon the old woman, O my lord,
hent me by the hand and bound the kerchief over my eyes as was
her wont and led me to the customed place when she loosed the
bandage saying, “Begone!” and disappeared. But I, O my lord,
became like a madman and ran through the streets as one frantic
crying, “Ah her loveliness! Ah her stature! Ah her perfect
grace! Ah her ornaments!” Hereupon the folk seeing me and
hearing me say these words shouted out, “Yonder is a lunatic;”
so they seized me perforce and jailed me in the madhouse as thou
hast seen me, O our lord the Sultan. They say, “This man is
Jinn-mad;” but, by Allah, I am no maniac, O my lord, and such
is my tale. Hereat the King marvelled and bowed his brow
groundwards for a while in deep thought over this affair: then he
raised his head and turning to his Minister said, “O Wazir, by the
truth of Him who made me ruler of this realm, except thou
discover the damsel who married this youth, thy head shall pay
forfeit.” The Wazir was consterned to hear the case of the young
man; but he could not disobey the royal commandment so he
said, “Allow me three days of delay, O our lord the Sultan;”
and to this much of grace the King consented. Then the Wazir
craved dismissal and would have taken the Youth with him; when
the Sultan cried, “As soon as thou shalt have hit upon the house,
the young man will go into it and come forth it like other folk.”
He replied, “Hearkening and obedience.” So he took the Youth
and went out with aching head and giddy as a drunken man,
perplexed and unknowing whither he should wend; and he
threaded the city streets from right to left and from east to west,
tarrying at times that he might privily question the folk. But
naught discovered itself to him and he made certain of death.
In this condition he continued for two days and the third till
noontide, when he devised him a device and said to the Youth,
“Knowest thou the spot where the old woman was wont to blindfold
thine eyes?” He replied, “Yes.” So the Minister walked on
with him till the young man exclaimed, “Here, ’tis this!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6773" id="noteref-6773" epub:type="noteref">6773</a> The
Wazir then said, “O Youth, knowest thou the door-ring wherewith
she was wont to rap and canst thou distinguish its sound?” He
said “I can.” Accordingly, the Wazir took him and went the
round of all the houses in that quarter and rapped with every
door-ring asking him, “Is’t this?” and he would answer, “No.”
And the twain ceased not to do after such fashion until they came
to the door where the appointment had taken place without risk
threatened;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6774" id="noteref-6774" epub:type="noteref">6774</a> and the Wazir knocked hard at it and the Youth,
hearing the knock, exclaimed, “O my lord, verily this be the ring
without question or doubt or uncertainty.” So the Minister
knocked again with the same knocker and the slave-girls threw
open the door and the Wazir, entering with the youth, found that
the palace belonged to the daughter of the Sultan who had been
succeeded by his liege lord.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6775" id="noteref-6775" epub:type="noteref">6775</a> But when the Princess saw the
Minister together with her spouse, she adorned herself and came
down from the Harem and salam’d to him. Thereupon he asked
her, “What hath been thy business with this young man?” So
she told him her tale from first to last and he said, “O my lady,
the King commandeth that he enter and quit the premises as before
and that he come hither without his eyes being bandaged with the
kerchief.” She obeyed and said, “The commandments of our
lord the Sultan shall be carried out.” Such was the history of
that youth whom the Sultan heard reading the Koran in the
Máristán, the public madhouse: but as regards the second Lunatic
who sat listening, the Sultan asked him, “And thou, the other,
what be thy tale?” So he began to relate the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>STORY OF THE SECOND LUNATIC.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6776" id="noteref-6776" epub:type="noteref">6776</a></h3>

<p class="c013">“O my lord,” quoth the young man, “my case is marvellous, and
haply thou wilt desire me to relate it in order continuous;” and
quoth the Sultan, “Let me hear it.”——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the second
youth said:——O my lord the Sultan, I am by calling a merchant
man and none of the guild was younger, I having just entered my
sixteenth year. Like my fellows I sold and bought in the Bazar
every day till, one day of the days, a damsel came up to me and
drew near and handed to me a paper which I opened; and behold,
it was full of verses and odes in praise of myself, and the end of
the letter contained the woman’s name professing to be enamoured
of me. When I read it I came down from my shopboard, in my
folly and ignorance, and putting forth my hand seized the girl and
beat her till she swooned away.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6777" id="noteref-6777" epub:type="noteref">6777</a> After this I let her loose and she
went her ways and then I fell into a brown study saying to myself,
“Would Heaven I wot whether the girl be without relations or if
she have kith and kin to whom she may complain and they will
come and bastinado me.” And, O our lord the Sultan, I repented
of what I had done whenas repentance availed me naught and
this lasted me for twenty days. At the end of that time as I was
sitting in my shop according to my custom, behold, a young lady
entered and she was sumptuously clad and sweetly scented and she
was even as the moon in its fullness on the fourteenth night. When
I gazed upon her my wits fled and my sane senses and right judgment
forsook me and I was incapable of attending to aught save
herself. She then came up and said, “O youth, hast thou by thee
a variety of metal ornaments?” and said I, “O my lady, of all
kinds thou canst possibly require.” Hereupon she wished to see
some anklets which I brought out for her, when she put forth her
feet to me and showing me the calves of her legs said, “O my lord,
try them on me.” This I did. Then she asked for a necklace<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6778" id="noteref-6778" epub:type="noteref">6778</a>
and I produced one when she unveiled her bosom and said, “Take
its measure on me:” so I set it upon her and she said, “I want a
fine pair of bracelets,” and I brought to her a pair when, extending
her hands and displaying her wrists she said to me, “Put them on
me.” I did so and presently she asked me, “What may be the
price of all these?” when I exclaimed, “O my lady, accept them
from me in free gift;” and this was of the excess of my love to her,
O King of the Age, and my being wholly absorbed in her. Then
quoth I to her, “O my lady, whose daughter art thou?” and quoth
she, “I am the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islám.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6779" id="noteref-6779" epub:type="noteref">6779</a> I replied,
“My wish, is to ask thee in marriage of thy father,” and she
rejoined, “’Tis well: but, O youth, I would have thee know that
when thou askest me from my sire he will say:——I have but one
daughter and she is a cripple and deformed even as Satíh was.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6780" id="noteref-6780" epub:type="noteref">6780</a> Do
thou, however make answer that thou art contented to accept her
and if he offer any remonstrance cry:——I’m content, content!”
I then enquired, “When shall that be?” and she replied, “To-morrow
about undurn hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6781" id="noteref-6781" epub:type="noteref">6781</a> come to our house and thou wilt find
my sire, the Shaykh al-Islam, sitting with his companions and
intimates. Then ask me to wife.” So we agreed upon this
counsel and on the next day, O our lord the Sultan, I went with
several of my comrades and we repaired, I and they, to the house
of the Shaykh al-Islam, whom I found sitting with sundry Grandees
about him. We made our salams which they returned and they
welcomed us and all entered into friendly and familiar conversation.
When it was time for the noon-meal the table-cloth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6782" id="noteref-6782" epub:type="noteref">6782</a> was spread
and they invited us to join them, so we dined with them and after
dinner drank coffee. I then stood up saying, “O my lord, I am
come hither to sue and solicit thee for the lady concealed and the
pearl unrevealed, thy daughter.” But when the Shaykh al-Islam
heard from me these words he bowed his head for awhile groundwards——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
resumed:——Now when the Shaykh al-Islam heard from me those
words he bowed his brow groundwards for a while in deep thought
concerning the case of his daughter who was a cripple and
wondrously deformed. For the damsel who had told me of her
had played me a trick and served me a sleight, I all the time
knowing nothing about her guile. Presently he raised his head
and said to me, “By Allah, O my son, I have a daughter but she
is helpless.” Quoth I, “I am content;” and quoth he, “An thou
take her to wife after this description, ’tis on express condition
that she be not removed from my house and thou also shalt pay
her the first visit and cohabit with her in my home.” I replied,
“To hear is to obey;” being confident, O King of the Age,
that she was the damsel who had visited my shop and whom
I had seen with my own eyes. Thereupon the Shaykh al-Islam
married his daughter to me and I said in my mind, “By Allah,
is it possible that I am become master of this damsel and shall
enjoy to my full her beauty and loveliness?” But when night
fell they led me in procession to the chamber of my bride;
and when I beheld her I found her hideous as her father had
described her, a deformed cripple. At that moment all manner
of cares mounted my back and I was full of fury and groaned
with grief from the core of my heart; but I could not say a
word, for that I had accepted her to wife of my own free will
and had declared myself contented in presence of her sire. So
I took seat silently in a corner of the room and my bride in
another, because I could not bring myself to approach her, she
being unfit for the carnal company of man and my soul could not
accept cohabitation with her. And at dawntide, O my lord the
Sultan, I left the house and went to my shop which I opened
according to custom and sat down with my head dizzy like one
drunken without wine; when lo! there appeared before me the
young lady who had caused happen to me that mishap. She came
up and salam’d to me but I arose with sullenness and abused her
and cried, “Wherefore, O my lady, hast thou put upon me such a
piece of work?” She replied, “O miserable,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6783" id="noteref-6783" epub:type="noteref">6783</a> recollect such a
day when I brought thee a letter and thou after reading it didst
come down from thy shop and didst seize me and didst trounce
me and didst drive me away.” I replied, “O my lady, prithee
pardon me for I am a true penitent;” and I ceased not to soften
her with soothing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6784" id="noteref-6784" epub:type="noteref">6784</a> words and promised her all weal if she would
but forgive me. At last she deigned excuse me and said, “There
is no harm for thee; and, as I have netted thee, so will I unmesh
thee.” I replied, “Allah! Allah!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6785" id="noteref-6785" epub:type="noteref">6785</a> O my lady, I am under thy
safeguard;” and she rejoined, “Hie thee to the Aghá of the
Janákilah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6786" id="noteref-6786" epub:type="noteref">6786</a> the gypsies, give him fifty piastres and say him:——We
desire thee to furnish us with a father and a mother and cousins
and kith and kin, and do thou charge them to say of me, “This is
our cousin and our blood relation.” Then let him send them all
to the house of the Shaykh al-Islam and repair thither himself
together with his followers, a party of drummers and a parcel of
pipers. When they enter his house and the Shaykh shall perceive
them and exclaim, What’s this we’ve here? let the Agha reply, O
my lord, we be kinsmen with thy son-in-law and we are come to
gladden his marriage with thy daughter and to make merry with
him. He will exclaim, Is this thy son a gypsey musician? and do
thou explain saying, Aye, verily I am a Jankali; and he will cry
out to thee, O dog, thou art a gypsey and yet durst thou marry
the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islam? Then do thou make
answer:—O my lord, ’twas my ambition to be ennobled by thine
alliance and I have espoused thy daughter only that the mean
name of Jankali may pass away from me and that I may be under
the skirt of thy protection.” Hereat, O my lord the Sultan, I arose
without stay and delay and did as the damsel bade me and agreed
with the Chiefs of the Gypsies for fifty piastres.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6787" id="noteref-6787" epub:type="noteref">6787</a> On the second
day about noon lo and behold! all the Janákilah met before the
house of the Shaykh al-Islam and they, a-tom-toming and a-piping
and a-dancing, crowded into the courtyard of the mansion.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youth
continued:—So the Janákilah entered the house of the Shaykh al-Islam
all a-drumming and a-dancing. Presently the family came
out and asked, “What is to do? And what be this hubbub?”
The fellows answered, “We are gypsey-folk and our son is in
your house having wedded the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islam.”
Hearing these words the family went up and reported to its head,
and he, rising from his seat, descended to the courtyard which he
found full of Jankalis. He enquired of them their need and they
told him that the youth, their kinsman, having married the daughter
of the house, they were come to make merry at the bride-feast.
Quoth the Shaykh, “This indeed be a sore calamity that a gypsey
should espouse the daughter of the Shaykh al-Islam. By Allah,
I will divorce her from him.” So he sent after me, O our lord
the Sultan, and asked me saying, “What is thy breed and what
wilt thou take to be off with thyself?” Said I, “A Jankali; and
I married thy daughter with one design namely to sink the mean
name of a gypsey drummer in the honour of connection and
relationship with thee.” He replied, “’Tis impossible that my
daughter can cohabit with thee: so up and divorce her.” I rejoined
“Not so: I will never repudiate her.” Then we fell to
quarrelling but the folk interposed between us and arranged that I
should receive forty purses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6788" id="noteref-6788" epub:type="noteref">6788</a> for putting her away. And when he
paid me the moneys I gave her the divorce and took the coin and
went to my shop, rejoicing at having escaped by this contrivance.
On the next day, behold, came the damsel who had taught me the
sleight and saluted me and wished me good morning. I returned
her salam and indeed, O our lord the Sultan, she was a model of
beauty and loveliness, stature and symmetrical grace and my heart
was enmeshed in her love for the excess of her charms and the
limpid flow of her speech and the sweetness of her tongue. So I
said to her, “And when this promise?” and said she, “I am the
daughter of Such-and-such, a cook in such a quarter; and do thou
go ask me in marriage of him.” So I rose up with all haste and
went to her father and prayed that he would give her to me. And
presently I wedded her and went in unto her and found her as the
full moon of the fourteenth night and was subjugated by her
seemlihead. Such, then, is the adventure which befel me; but, O
my lord the Sultan, the Story of the Sage Such-an-one and his
Scholar is more wonderful and delectable; for indeed ’tis of the
marvels of the age and among the miracles which have been
seen by man. Thereupon the Sovran bade him speak, and the
Second Lunatic proceeded to recount the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>STORY OF THE SAGE AND THE SCHOLAR.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6789" id="noteref-6789" epub:type="noteref">6789</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was in times of yore and in ages long gone before a
learned man who had retired from the world secluding himself in
an upper cell of a Cathedral-mosque, and this place he left not
for many days save upon the most pressing needs. At last a
beautiful boy whose charms were unrivalled in his time went in to
him and salam’d to him. The Shaykh returned the salute and
welcomed him with the fairest welcome and courteously entreated
him seating him beside himself. Then he asked him of his case
and whence he came and the boy answered, “O my lord, question
me not of aught nor of my worldly matters, for verily I am as
one who hath fallen from the heavens upon the earth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6790" id="noteref-6790" epub:type="noteref">6790</a> and my sole
object is the honour of tending thee.” The Sage again welcomed
him and the boy served him assiduously for a length of time
till he was twelve years old. Now on one day of the days<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6791" id="noteref-6791" epub:type="noteref">6791</a> the
lad heard certain of his fellows saying that the Sultan had a
daughter endowed with beauty whose charms were unequalled by
all the Princesses of the age. So he fell in love with her by
hearsay.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night,
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the lad who served the
Sage fell in love with the Sultan’s daughter by hearsay. Presently
he went in to his master and told him thereof adding, “O my lord,
verily the King hath a daughter beautiful and lovesome and my
soul longeth to look upon her an it be only a single look.” The
Shaykh asked him saying, “Wherefore, O my son? What have
the like of us to do with the daughters of Sovrans or others? We
be an order of eremites and self-contained and we fear the Kings
for our own safety.” And the Sage continued to warn the lad
against the shifts of Time and to divert him from his intent; but
the more words he uttered to warn him and to deter him, the more
resolved he became to win his wish, so that he abode continually
groaning and weeping. Now this was a grievous matter to the good
Shaykh who loved him with an exceeding love passing all bounds;
and when he saw him in this condition he exclaimed, “There is
no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great.” And his heart was softened and he had ruth upon the
case of his scholar and pitied his condition, and at last said to
him, “O my son, dost thou truly long to look but a single look at
the Sultan’s daughter?” Quoth he, “Yes, O my lord,” and quoth
the other, “Come hither to me.” Accordingly he came up to him
and the Shaykh produced a Kohl-pot and applied the powder to
one of his scholar’s eyes, who behold, forthright became such that
all who saw him cried out, “This is a half-man.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6792" id="noteref-6792" epub:type="noteref">6792</a> Then the Sage
bade him go about the city and the youth obeyed his commands
and fared forth; but whenas the folk espied him they cried out,
“A miracle! a miracle! this be a half-man!” And the more the
youth walked about the streets the more the folk followed him and
gazed upon him for diversion and marvelled at the spectacle; and
as often as the great men of the city heard of him they sent to
summon him and solaced themselves with the sight and said, “Laud
to the Lord! Allah createth whatso He wisheth and commandeth
whatso He willeth as we see in the fashioning of this half-man.”
The youth also looked freely upon the Haríms of the Grandees, he
being fairer than any of them; and this case continued till the
report reached the Sultan who bade him be brought into the presence,
and on seeing him marvelled at the works of the Almighty.
Presently the whole court gathered together to gaze at him in
wonderment and the tidings soon reached the Queen who sent an
Eunuch to fetch him and introduce him into the Serraglio. The
women all admired the prodigy and the Princess looked at him and
he looked at her; so his fascination increased upon him and he said
in his secret soul, “An I wed her not I will slay myself!” After
this the youth was dismissed by the Sultan’s Harim and he, whose
heart burned with love for the King’s daughter, returned home.
The Shaykh asked him, “Hast thou, O my son, seen the Princess?”
and he answered, “I have, O my master; but this one look sufficeth
me not, nor can I rest until I sit by her side and fill myself with
gazing upon her.” Quoth he, “O my child, we be an ascetic folk
that shun the world nor have we aught to do with enmeshing ourselves
in the affairs of the Sultan, and we fear for thee, O my son.”
But the youth replied, “O my lord, except I sit by her side and
stroke her neck and shoulders with these my hands, I will slay
myself.” Hereupon the Sage said in his mind, “I will do whatso I
can for this good youth and perchance Allah may enable him to
win his wish.” He then arose and brought out the Kohl-pot and
applied the powder to his scholar’s either eye; and, when it had
settled therein, it made him invisible to the ken of man. Then
he said, “Go forth, O my son, and indulge thy desire; but return
again soon and be not absent too long.” Accordingly the youth
hastened to the Palace and entering it looked right and left, none
seeing him the while, and proceeded to the Harem where he seated
himself beside the daughter of the Sultan. Still none perceived
him until, after a time, he put forth his hand and softly stroked
her neck. But as soon as the Princess felt the youth’s touch, she
shrieked a loud shriek heard by all ears in the Palace and cried
“I seek refuge with Allah from Satan the stoned!” At this proceeding
on the girl’s part all asked her saying, “What is to do
with thee?” Whereto she answered, “Verily some Satan hath this
instant touched me on the neck.” Upon this her mother was
alarmed for her and sent for her nurse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6793" id="noteref-6793" epub:type="noteref">6793</a> and when informed of what
had befallen the girl the old woman said, “If there be aught
of Satans here naught is so sovereign a specific to drive them
away and keep them off as the smoke of camel’s dung.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6794" id="noteref-6794" epub:type="noteref">6794</a> Then
she arose and brought thereof a quantity which was thrown into
the fire and presently it scented and pervaded the whole apartment.
All this and the Youth still sat there without being seen. But
when the dung-smoke thickened, his eyes brimmed and he could
not but shed tears, and the more smoke there was the more his
eyes watered and big drops flowed till at last all the Kohl was
washed off and trickled down with the tears. So he became
visible amiddlemost the royal Harem; and, when the dames
descried him, all shrieked one shriek, each at other, upon which
the Eunuchry rushed in; then, finding the young man still seated
there, they laid hands upon him and haled him before the Sultan
to whom they reported his crime and how he had been caught
lurking in the King’s Serraglio a-sitting beside the Princess.
Hearing this, the Sovran bade summon the Headsman and committed
to him the criminal bidding him take the youth and robe
him in a black habit bepatched with flame-colour;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6795" id="noteref-6795" epub:type="noteref">6795</a> then, to set
him upon a camel and, after parading him through Cairo city and
all the streets, to put him to death. Accordingly the executioner
took the Youth.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was
the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Fifty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Linkman
took the youth and fared forth with him from the palace: then he
looked at him and found him fair of form and favour, a sans peer
in loveliness, and he observed that he showed no fear nor shrinking
from death. So he had pity upon him and his heart yearned to
him and he said in his mind, “By Allah, attached to this young
man is a rare history.” Then he brought a leathern gown which
he put upon him, and the flamey black habit which he passed over
his arms: and setting him upon a camel as the Sultan had commanded,
at last carried him in procession crying out the while,
“This is the award and the least award of him who violateth the
Harem of the King;” and he threaded the streets till they came
to the square before the great Mosque wherein was the Shaykh.
Now as all the folk were enjoying the spectacle, the Sage looked
out from the window of his cell and beheld the condition of his
scholar. He was moved to ruth and reciting a spell he summoned
the Jánn and bade them snatch the young man off the camel’s back
with all care and kindness and bring him to his cell; and he also
commanded an ’Aun of the ’Auns<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6796" id="noteref-6796" epub:type="noteref">6796</a> to seize some oldster and set
him upon the beast in lieu of the Youth. They did as he bid them
for that he had taken fealty of the Jánn and because of his profound
studies in the Notaricon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6797" id="noteref-6797" epub:type="noteref">6797</a> and every branch of the art magical.
And when all the crowd saw the youth suddenly transformed
into a grey-beard they were awe-stricken and cried, “Alhamdolillah—laud
to the Lord—the young man hath become an old man!”
They then looked again and behold, they saw a person well-known
amongst the lieges, one who had long been wont to sell greens and
colocasia at the hostelry gate near the Cathedral-mosque. Now
the headsman noting this case was confounded with sore affright;
so he returned to the palace with the oldster seated on the camel
and went in to the Sultan followed by all the city-folk who were
gazing at the spectacle. Then he stood before the King and the
eunuchry and did homage and prayed for the Sovran and said,
“O our lord the Sultan, verily the Youth hath vanished, and in
lieu of him is this Shaykh well known to the whole city.” Hearing
these words the King was startled; sore fear entered his heart
and he said to himself, “Whoso hath been able to do this deed can
do e’en more: he can depose me from my kingship or he can
devise my death.” So his affright increased and he was at a loss
how to contrive for such case. Presently he summoned his Minister
and when he came into the presence said to him, “O Wazir,
advise me how to act in the affair of this Youth and what measures
should be taken.” The Minister bowed his brow groundwards in
thought for a while, then raising it he addressed the Sultan and
said, “O King of the Age, this be a thing beyond experience, and
the doer must be master of a might we comprehend not and
haply he may work thee in the future some injury and we fear
from him for thy daughter. Wherefore the right way is that
thou issue a royal autograph and bid the Crier go round about the
city and cry saying:—Let him who hath wrought this work appear
before the King under promise of safety and again safety—safety
on the word of a Sultan which shall never be falsed. Should the
Youth then surrender himself, O King of the Age, marry him to
thy daughter when perhaps his mind may be reconciled to thee by
love of her. He hath already cast eyes upon her and he hath seen
the inmates of thy Harem unrobed, so that naught can save their
honour but his being united with the Princess.” Hereupon the
Sultan indited an autographic rescript and placed it in the Crier’s
hands even as the Wazir had counselled: and the man went about
the streets proclaiming, “By Command of the just King! whoso
hath done this deed let him discover himself and come to the
Palace under promise of safety and again safety, the safety of
sovereigns—safety on the word of a Sultan which shall never be
falsed.” And the Crier ceased not crying till in fine he reached
the square fronting the great Mosque. The Youth who was standing
there heard the proclamation and returning to his Shaykh said
“O my lord, the Crier hath a rescript from the Sultan and he crieth
saying, Whoso hath done this deed let him discover himself and
come to the Palace under promise of safety and again safety—safety
on the word of a Sultan which shall never be falsed. And,
I must go to him perforce.” Said the Sage, “O my son, why
shouldst thou do on such wise? Hast thou not already suffered
thy sufficiency?” But the young man exclaimed, “Nothing shall
prevent my going;” and at this the Shaykh replied, “Go then,
O my son, and be thy safeguarding with the Living, the Eternal.”
Accordingly, the Youth repaired to the Hammam and having
bathed attired himself in the richest attire he owned, after which
he went forth and discovered himself to the Crier who led him
to the Palace and set him before the Sovran. He salamed to
the Sultan and did him obeisance and prayed for his long life
and prosperity in style the most eloquent, and proffered his petition
in verse the most fluent. The Sultan looked at him (and he
habited in his best and with all of beauty blest), and the royal
mind was pleased and he enquired saying, “Who art thou,
O Youth?” The other replied, “I am the Half-man whom thou
sawest and I did the deed whereof thou wottest.” As soon as
the King heard this speech he entreated him with respect and
bade him sit in the most honourable stead, and when he was
seated the twain conversed together. The Sultan was astounded
at his speech and they continued their discourse till
they touched upon sundry disputed questions of learning,
when the Youth proved himself as superior to the Sovran as a
dinar is to a dirham: and to whatever niceties of knowledge the
monarch asked, the young man returned an all-sufficient answer,
speaking like a book. So the Sultan abode confounded at the
eloquence of his tongue and the purity of his phrase and the
readiness of his replies; and he said in his mind, “This Youth is as
worthy to become my daughter’s mate as she is meet to become
his helpmate.” Then he addressed him in these words, “O Youth,
my wish is to unite thee with my daughter and after thou hast
looked upon her and her mother none will marry her save thyself.”
The other replied, “O King of the Age, I am ready to obey thee,
but first I must take counsel of my friends.” The King rejoined,
“No harm in that: hie thee home and ask their advice.” The
Youth then craved leave to retire and repairing to his Shaykh,——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night, an the

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Youth then
craved leave to retire and, repairing to his Shaykh, informed him
of what had passed between himself and the Sultan and said to
him, “’Tis also my wish, O my lord, to marry his daughter.” The
Sage replied, “There be no fault herein if it be lawful wedlock:
fare thee forth and ask her in marriage.” Quoth the Youth, “But
I, O my lord, desire to invite the King to visit us;” and quoth
the Sage, “Go invite him, O my son, and hearten thy heart.” The
Youth replied, “O my lord, since I first came to thee and thou didst
honour me by taking me into thy service, I have known none
other home save this narrow cell wherein thou sittest, never stirring
from it or by night or by day. How can we invite the King
hither?” The Sage rejoined, “O my son, do thou go invite him
relying upon Allah, the Veiler who veileth all things, and say to
him:——My Shaykh greeteth thee with the salam and inviteth
thee to visit him next Friday.” Accordingly, the Youth repaired
to the King and saluted him and offered his service and blessed
him with most eloquent tongue and said, “O King of the Age,
my Shaykh greeteth thee and sayeth to thee:——Come eat thy
pottage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6798" id="noteref-6798" epub:type="noteref">6798</a> with us next Friday,” whereto the Sultan replied, “Hearing
is consenting.” Then the Youth returned to the Sage and
waited upon him according to custom, longing the while for the
coming of Friday. On that day the Sage said to the Youth, “O
my son, arise with me and I will show thee what house be ours, so
thou mayst go fetch the King.” Then he took him and the two
walked on till they came upon a ruin in the centre of the city and
the whole was in heaps, mud, clay, and stones. The Sage looked
at it and said, “O my son, this is our mansion; do thou hie thee
to the King and bring him hither.” But the Youth exclaimed,
“O my lord, verily this be a ruinous heap! How then can I invite
the Sultan and bring him to such an ill place? This were a shame
and a disgrace to us.” Quoth the Sage, “Go and dread thou
naught.” Upon this the Youth departed saying in himself, “By
Allah, my Shaykh must be Jinn-mad and doubtless he confoundeth
in his insanity truth and untruth.” But he stinted not faring till
he reached the Palace and went in to the Sultan whom he found
expecting him; so he delivered the message, “Deign honour us,
O my lord, with thy presence.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6799" id="noteref-6799" epub:type="noteref">6799</a> Hereupon the King arose without
stay or delay and took horse, and all the lords of the land also
mounted, following the Youth to the place where he told them his
Shaykh abode. But when they drew near it they found a royal
mansion and eunuchry standing at the gates in costliest gear as if
robed from a talismanic hoard. When the young man saw this
change of scene, he was awe-struck and confounded in such way
that hardly could he keep his senses, and he said to himself, “But
an instant ago I beheld with mine own eyes this very place a
ruinous heap: how then hath it suddenly become on this same
site a Palace such as belongeth not to our Sultan? But I had
better keep the secret to myself.” Presently the King alighted as
also did his suite, and entered the mansion, and whenas he inspected
it he marvelled at the splendour of the first apartment, but the
more narrowly he looked the more magnificent he found the place,
and the second more sumptuous than the first. So his wits were
bewildered thereat till he was ushered into a spacious speak-room
where they found the Shaykh sitting on one side of the chamber<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6800" id="noteref-6800" epub:type="noteref">6800</a>
to receive them. The Sultan salam’d to him whereupon the Sage
raised his head and returned his greeting but did not rise to his
feet. The King then sat him down on the opposite side when the
Shaykh honoured him by addressing him and was pleased to converse
with him on various themes; all this while the royal senses
being confounded at the grandeur around him and the rarities in
that Palace. Presently the Shaykh said to his Scholar, “Knock
thou at this door and bid our breakfast be brought in.” So the
young man arose and rapped and called out “Bring in the breakfast;”
when lo! the door was opened and there came out of it an
hundred Mamelukes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6801" id="noteref-6801" epub:type="noteref">6801</a> of the Book, each bearing upon his head a
golden tray, whereon were set dishes of precious metals; and these,
which were filled with breakfast-meats of all kinds and colours,
they ranged in order before the Sultan. He was surprised at the
sight for that he had naught so splendid in his own possession;
but he came forwards and ate, as likewise did the Shaykh and all
the courtiers till they were satisfied. And after this they drank
coffee and sherbets, and the Sultan and the Shaykh fell to conversing
on questions of lore: the King was edified by the words of
the Sage who on his part sat respectfully between the Sovran’s
hands. Now when it was well nigh noon, the Shaykh again said
to his Scholar, “Knock thou at that door and bid our noon-day meal
be brought in.” He arose and rapped and called out, “Bring
in the dinner;” when lo! the door opened of itself and there came
out of it an hundred white slaves all other than the first train and
each bearing a tray upon his head. They spread the Sufrah-cloth
before the Sultan and ranged the dishes, and he looked at the plates
and observed that they were of precious metals and stones; whereat
he was more astonished than before and he said to himself, “In
very deed this be a miracle!” So all ate their sufficiency when
basins and ewers, some of gold and others of various noble ores,
were borne round and they washed their hands, after which the
Shaykh said, “O King, at how much hast thou valued for us the
dower of thy daughter?” The Sovran replied, “My daughter’s
dower is already in my hands.” This he said of his courtesy and
respect, but the Shaykh replied, “Marriage is invalid save with a
dower.” He then presented to him a mint of money and the tie
of wedlock was duly tied; after which he rose and brought for his
guest a pelisse of furs such as the Sultan never had in his treasury
and invested him therewith and he gave rich robes to each and
every of his courtiers according to their degree. The Sultan then
took leave of the Shaykh and accompanied by the Scholar returned
to the Palace.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan took
with him the Scholar and they fared till they reached the citadel
and entered the Palace, during which time the King was pondering
the matter and wondering at the affair. And when night came
he bade them get ready his daughter that the first visit might be
paid to her by the bridegroom. They did his bidding and carried
the Youth in procession to her and he found the apartment
bespread with carpets and perfumed with essences; the bride,
however was absent. So he said in his mind, “She will come
presently albeit now she delayeth;” and he ceased not expecting
her till near midnight, whilst the father and the mother said,
“Verily the young man hath married our daughter and now
sleepeth with her.” On this wise the Youth kept one reckoning
and the Sultan and his Harem kept another till it was hard upon
dawn——all this and the bridegroom watched in expectation of
the bride. Now when the day brake, the mother came to visit
her child expecting to see her by the side of her mate; but she
could not find a trace of her, nor could she gather any clear
tidings of her. Accordingly she asked the Youth, her son-in-law,
who answered that since entering the apartment he had expected
his bride but she came not to him nor had he seen a sign of her.
Hereupon the Queen shrieked and rose up calling aloud upon her
daughter, for she had none other child save that one. The
clamour alarmed the Sultan who asked what was to do and was
informed that the Princess was missing from the Palace and had
not been seen after she had entered it at eventide. Thereupon he
went to the Youth and asked him anent her, but he also told him
that he had not found her when the procession led him into the
bridal chamber. Such was the case with these; but as regards
the Princess, when they conducted her to the bridal room before
the coming of the bridegroom, a Jinni<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6802" id="noteref-6802" epub:type="noteref">6802</a> of the Márids, who often
visited the royal Harem, happened to be there on the marriage-night
and was so captivated by the charms of the bride that he
took seat in a corner, and upon her entering and before she was
ware snatched her up and soared with her high in air. And he
flew with her till he reached a pleasant place of trees and rills
some three months’ journey from the city, and in that shady place
he set her down. But he wrought her no bodily damage and
every day he would bring her whatso she wanted of meat and
drink and solaced her by showing her the rills and trees. Now
this Jinni had changed his shape to that of a fair youth fearing
lest his proper semblance affright her, and the girl abode in that
place for a space of forty days. But the father, after failing to find
his daughter, took the Youth and repaired to the Shaykh in his
cell, and he was as one driven mad as he entered and complained
of the loss of his only child. The Shaykh hearing these words
dove into the depths of meditation for an hour: then he raised his
head and bade them bring before him a chafing-dish of lighted
charcoal. They fetched all he required and he cast into the fire
some incenses over which he pronounced formulæ of incantation,
and behold! the world was turned topsy-turvy and the winds
shrieked and the earth was canopied by dust-clouds whence
descended at speed winged troops bearing standards and colours.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6803" id="noteref-6803" epub:type="noteref">6803</a>
And amiddlemost of them appeared three Sultans of the Jánn
all crying out at once, “Labbayka! Labbayka! Adsumus,
hither we speed to undertake thy need.” The Shaykh then
addressed them, saying, “My commandment is that forthright ye
bring me the Jinni who hath snatched away the bride of my son,”
and they said, “To hear is to obey,” and at once commanded
fifty of their dependent Jinns to reconduct the Princess to her
chamber and to hale the culprit before them. These orders were
obeyed: they disappeared for an hour or so and suddenly returned,
bringing the delinquent Jinni in person; but as for the Sultan’s
daughter, ten of them conveyed her to her Palace, she wotting
naught of them and not feeling aught of fear. And when they
set the Jinni before the Shaykh, he bade the three Sultans of the
Jann burn him to death and so they did without stay or delay.
All this was done whilst the Sovran sat before the Shaykh,
looking on and listening and marvelling at the obedience of that
host and its Sultans and their subjection and civil demeanour in
presence of the Elder. Now as soon as the business ended after
perfectest fashion, the Sage recited over them a spell and all went
their several ways; after which he bade the King take the Youth
and conduct him to his daughter. This bidding was obeyed and
presently the bridegroom abated the maidenhead of the bride,
what while her parents renewed their rejoicings over the recovery
of their lost child. And the Youth was so enamoured of the
Princess that he quitted not the Harem for seven consecutive days.
On the eighth the Sultan was minded to make a marriage-banquet
and invited all the city-folk to feast for a whole month and he
wrote a royal rescript and bade proclaim with full publicity that,
according to the commands of the King’s majesty, the wedding-feast
should continue for a month, and that no citizen, be he rich
or be he poor, should light fire or trim lamp in his own domicile
during the wedding of the Princess; but that all must eat of the
royal entertainment until the expiry of the fête. So they
slaughtered beeves and stabbed camels in the throat and the
kitcheners and carpet-spreaders were commanded to prepare the
stables, and the officers of the household were ordered to receive
the guests by night and by day. Now one night King Mohammed
of Cairo said to his Minister, “O Wazir, do thou come with me in
changed costume and let us thread the streets and inspect and espy
the folk: haply some of the citizens have neglected to appear at
the marriage-feast.” He replied, “To hear is to obey.” So the
twain after exchanging habits for the gear of Persian Darwayshes
went down to the city and there took place</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF SULTAN MOHAMMED OF CAIRO.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6804" id="noteref-6804" epub:type="noteref">6804</a></h3>

<p class="c013">The Sultan and the Wazir threaded the broadways of the city and
they noted the houses and stood for an hour or so in each and
every greater thoroughfare, till they came to a lane, a cul-de-sac
wherethrough none could pass, and behold, they hit upon a house
containing a company of folk. Now these were conversing and
saying, “By Allah, our Sultan hath not acted wisely nor hath he
any cause to be proud, since he hath made his daughter’s bride-feast
a vanity and a vexation and the poor are excluded therefrom.
He had done better to distribute somewhat of his bounty amongst
the paupers and the mesquin, who may not enter his palace nor
can they obtain aught to eat.” Hearing this the Sultan said to
the Wazir, “By Allah, needs must we enter this place;” and the
Minister replied, “Do whatso thou willest.” Accordingly the
King went up to the door and knocked, when one came out and
asked, “Who is at the door?” The Sultan answered, “Guests;”
and the voice rejoined, “Welcome to the guests;” and the door
was thrown open. Then they went in till they reached the sittingroom
where they found three men of whom one was lame, the
second was broken-backed and the third was split-mouthed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6805" id="noteref-6805" epub:type="noteref">6805</a> And
all three were sitting together in that place. So he asked them,
“Wherefore sit ye here, ye three, instead of going to the Palace?”
and they answered him, “O Darwaysh, ’tis of the weakness of
our wits!” The King then turned to his Minister and said,
“There is no help but thou must bring these three men into my
presence, as soon as the wedding-fêtes be finished, that I may
enquire into what stablished their imbecility.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
said to the Wazir, “Needs must thou bring these three men into
my presence, as soon as the wedding-fêtes be finished, and we will
enquire into what proved their imbecility.” Then quoth the King
to them, “Wherefore fare ye not, ye three, and eat of the royal
banquet day by day?” and quoth they, “O Darwaysh, we are
crippled folk who cannot go and come, for this be grievous to us;
but, an the Sultan would assign to us somewhat of victual, and
send it hither, we would willingly eat thereof.” He rejoined,
“What knoweth the Sultan that ye sit in this place?” and they
retorted, “Ye be Darwayshes who enter everywhere: so when ye
go in to him, tell him our tale; haply shall Almighty Allah incline
his heart uswards.” The King asked them, “Be you three ever
sitting together in this stead?” and they answered, “Yea, verily:
we never leave one another by night or by day.” Then the King
and the Minister rose up and having presented them with a few
silvers took leave and departed. Now it was midnight when they
reached a tenement wherein sat three girls with their mother
spinning and eating; and each one appeared fairer than her fellows,
and at times they sang and then they laughed and then they talked.
The Sultan said to the Wazir, “There is no help but we enter
to these damsels;” whereto the Minister replied “What have
we to do with going near them? Let them be as they are!”
The Sultan, however, rejoined, “Needs must we enter,” and the
Wazir retorted, “Hearkening and obedience;” and he rapped at
the door when one of the sisterhood cried out, “Who knocketh
in this gloom of the night?” The Minister answered, “We are
two Darwayshes, guests and strangers;” and the girl rejoined,
“We are maidens with our mother and we have no men in our
house who can admit you; so fare ye to the marriage-feast of
the Sultan and become ye his guests.” The Minister continued,
“We are foreigners and we know not the way to the Palace and
we dread lest the Chief of Police happen upon us and apprehend
us at this time o’ night. We desire that you afford us lodging
till daylight when we will go about our business and you need
not expect from us aught save respect and honourable treatment.”
Now when the mother heard this, she pitied them and bade one
daughter open the door. So the damsel threw it open and the
Sultan and Wazir entered and salam’d and sat down to converse
together; but the King gazed upon the sisters and marvelled
at their beauty and their loveliness, and said in his mind, “How
cometh it that these maidens dwell by themselves unmated and
they in such case?” So quoth he to them, “How is it ye lack
husbands, you being so beautiful, and that ye have not a man
in the house?” Quoth the youngest, “O Darwaysh, hold thy
tongue<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6806" id="noteref-6806" epub:type="noteref">6806</a> nor ask us of aught, for our story is wondrous and our
adventures marvellous. But ’ware thy words and shorten thy
speech; verily hadst thou been the Sultan and thy companion the
Wazir an you heard our history haply ye had taken compassion
upon our case.” Thereupon the King turned to the Minister and
said, “Up with us and wend we our ways; but first do thou
make sure of the place and affix thy mark upon the door.” Then
the twain rose up and fared forth but the Wazir stood awhile and
set a sign upon the entrance and there left his imprint; after
which the twain returned to the Palace. Presently the youngest
sister said to her mother, “By Allah, I fear lest the Darwayshes
have made their mark upon our door to the end that they may
recognise it by day; for haply the twain may be the King and
his Minister.” “What proof hast thou of this?” asked the
mother, and the daughter answered, “Their language and their
questioning which were naught save importunity!” And saying
this she went to the door where she found the sign and mark.
Now besides the two houses to the right and to the left were
fifteen doors, so the girl marked them all with the same mark set
by the Wazir.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6807" id="noteref-6807" epub:type="noteref">6807</a> But when Allah had caused the day to dawn,
the King said to the Minister, “Go thou and look at the sign
and make sure of it.” The Wazir went as he was commanded
by the Sultan, but he found all the doors marked in the same way,
whereat he marvelled and knew not nor could he distinguish the
door he sought. Presently he returned and reported the matter
of the door-marks to the King who cried, “By Allah, these girls
must have a curious history! But when the bride-feast is finished
we will enquire into the case of the three men who are weakwitlings
and then we will consider that of the damsels who are
not.” As soon as the thirtieth feast-day passed by, he invested
with robes of honour all the Lords of his land and the high Officers
of his estate and matters returned to their customed course.
Then he sent to summon the three men who had professed themselves
weak of wits and they were brought into the presence, each
saying of himself, “What can the King require of us?” When
they came before him he bade them be seated and they sat;
then he said to them, “My requirement is that ye relate to me
proofs of the weakness of your minds and the reason of your
maims.” Now the first who was questioned was he of the broken
back, and when the enquiry was put to him he said, “Deign to
favour me with an answer O our Lord the Sultan, on a matter
which passed through my mind.” He replied, “Speak out and
fear not!” So the other enquired, “How didst thou know us
and who told thee of us and of our weakly wits?” Quoth the
King, “’Twas the Darwaysh who went in to you on such a
night;” and quoth the broken-backed man, “Allah slay all the
Darwayshes who be tattlers and tale-carriers!” Thereupon the
Sultan turned to the Wazir and laughing said, “We will not
reproach them for aught: rather let us make fun of them,”
adding to the man, “Recite, O Shaykh.” So he fell to telling</p>

be other than sleeping, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Shaykh
continued.——I began life, O my lord, as a Schoolmaster, and
my tale with the boys was wondrous. They numbered from
sixty to seventy, and I taught them to read and I inculcated
due discipline and ready respect esteeming these a part of liberal
education; nor did I regard, O King of the Age, the vicissitudes
of Time and Change; nay, I held them with so tight a rein that
whenever the boys heard me sneeze<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6809" id="noteref-6809" epub:type="noteref">6809</a> they were expected to lay
down their writing-tablets and stand up with their arms crossed
and exclaim, “Allah have ruth upon thee, O our lord!” whereto
I would make reply, “Allah deign pardon us and you!” And
if any of the lads failed or delayed to join in this prayer I was
wont to bash him with a severe bashing. One day of the days
they asked leave to visit the outskirts of the town for liberty and
pleasuring<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6810" id="noteref-6810" epub:type="noteref">6810</a> and when I granted it they clubbed their pittances
for a certain sum of money to buy them a noon-day meal. So we
went forth to the suburbs and there found verdure and water, and
we enjoyed ourselves that day with perfect enjoyment until mid-afternoon
when we purposed to return homewards. Accordingly,
the boys collected their belongings and laded them upon an ass
and we walked about half-way when behold, the whole party,
big and little, stood still and said to me, “O our lord, we are
athirst and burning with drowthiness, nor can we stir from this
spot and if we leave it without drinking we shall all die.” Now
there was in that place a draw-well, but it was deep and we had
nor pitcher nor bucket nor aught wherein to draw water and the
scholars still suffered from exceeding thirst. We had with us,
however, cooking-gear such as chauldrons and platters; so I said
to them, “O boys, whoso carrieth a cord or hath bound his
belongings with one let him bring it hither!” They did my
bidding and I tied these articles together and spliced them as
strongly as I could: then said I to the lads, “Bind me under the
armpits.” Accordingly they made me fast by passing the rope
around me and I took with me a chauldron, whereupon they let
me down bucket-wise into the well till I reached the water.
Then I loosed the bandage from under my armpits and tied
it to the chauldron which I filled brim-full and shook the rope
for a signal to the boys above. They haled at the vessel till they
pulled it up and began drinking and giving drink; and on this wise
they drew a first chauldron and a second and a third and a fourth
till they were satisfied and could no more and cried out to me, “We
have had enough, quite enough.” Hereupon I bound the bandage
under my armpits, as it was when I went down, and I shook it
as a signal and they haled me up till I had well-nigh reached the
kerbstone of the well when a fit of sneezing seized me and I
sneezed violently. At this all let go their hold and carrying
their arms over their breasts, cried aloud, “Allah have ruth upon
thee, O our lord!” but I, as soon as they loosed hold, fell into
the depths of the well and brake my back. I shrieked for excess
of agony and all the boys ran on all sides screaming for aid till
they were heard by some wayfaring folk; and these haled at me
and drew me out. They placed me upon the ass and bore me
home: then they brought a leach to medicine me and at last
I became even as thou seest me, O Sultan of the Age. Such, then,
is my story showing the weakness of my wits; for had I not
enjoined and enforced over-respect the boys would not have let
go their hold when I happened to sneeze nor would my back
have been broken. “Thou speakest sooth, O Shaykh,” said the
Sultan, “and indeed thou hast made evident the weakness of thy
wit.” Then quoth he to the man who was cloven of mouth.
“And thou, the other, what was it split thy gape?” “The
weakness of my wit, O my lord the Sultan,” quoth he, and fell
to telling the</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>STORY OF THE SPLIT-MOUTHED SCHOOLMASTER.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6811" id="noteref-6811" epub:type="noteref">6811</a></h3>

<p class="c013">I also began life, O King of the Age, as a schoolmaster and had
under my charge some eighty boys. Now I was strict with such
strictness that from morning to evening I sat amongst them and
would never dismiss them to their homes before sundown. But
’tis known to thee, O our lord the King, that boys’ wits be short
after the measure of their age, and that they love naught save play
and forgathering in the streets and quarter. Withal, I took no
heed of this and ever grew harder upon them till one day all met
and with the intervention of the eldest Monitor they agreed and
combined to play me a trick. He arranged with them that next
morning none should enter the school until he had taught them,
each and every, to say as they went in, “Thy safety, O our lord,
how yellow is thy face!” Now the first who showed himself was
the Monitor and he spoke as had been agreed; but I was rough
with him and sent him away; then a second came in and repeated
what the first had said; then a third and then a fourth, until ten
boys had used the same words. So quoth I to myself, “Ho, Such-an-one!
thou must be unwell without weeting it:” then I arose
and went into the Harem and lay down therein when the Monitor,
having collected from his school-fellows some hundred-and-eighty
Nusfs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6812" id="noteref-6812" epub:type="noteref">6812</a> came in to me and cried, “Take this, O our lord, and
expend the money upon thy health.” Thereupon I said to myself,
“Ho, Such-an-one! every Thursday<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6813" id="noteref-6813" epub:type="noteref">6813</a> thou dost not collect sixty
Faddahs from the boys,” and I cried to him, “Go, let them forth
for a holiday.” So he went and dismissed them from school to the
playground. On the next day he collected as much as on the first
and came in to me and said, “Expend these moneys, O our lord,
upon thy health.” He did the same on the third day and the
fourth, making the boys contribute much coin and presenting it to
me; and on such wise he continued till the tenth day, when he
brought the money as was his wont. At that time I happened to
hold in my hand a boiled egg which I purposed eating, but on
sighting him I said in myself, “An he see thee feeding he will
cut off the supplies.” So I crammed the egg into my chops——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared
with that I would relate to you on the coming night, an the
Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next night
and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah, upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:—With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Schoolmaster
said to himself, “If the Monitor see me eating the egg now in thy
hand he will cut off the supplies and assert thee to be sound.” So
(continued he) I crammed the egg into my chops and clapped my
jaws together. Hereupon the lad turned to me and cried, “O my
lord, thy cheek is much swollen;” and I, “’Tis only an imposthume.”
But he drew a whittle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6814" id="noteref-6814" epub:type="noteref">6814</a> forth his sleeve and coming up to
me seized my cheek and slit it, when the egg fell out and he said,
“O my lord, this it was did the harm and now ’tis passed away
from thee.” Such was the cause of the splitting of my mouth, O our
lord the Sultan. Now had I cast away greed of gain and eaten
the egg in the Monitor’s presence, what could have been the ill
result? But all this was of the weakness of my wit; for also
had I dismissed the boys every day about mid-afternoon, I should
have gained naught nor lost aught thereby. However the Dealer
of Destiny is self-existent, and this is my case. Then the Sultan
turned to the Wazir and laughed and said, “The fact is that whoso
schooleth boys is weak of wit;” and said the other, “O King of
the Age, all pedagogues lack perceptives and reflectives; nor can
they become legal witnesses before the Kazi because verily they
credit the words of little children without evidence of the speech
being or factual or false. So their reward in the world to come
must be abounding!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6815" id="noteref-6815" epub:type="noteref">6815</a> Then the Sultan asked the limping man,
saying, “And thou, the other, what lamed thee?” So he began
to tell</p>

<h3 class="c012"><em>THE STORY OF THE LIMPING SCHOOLMASTER.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6816" id="noteref-6816" epub:type="noteref">6816</a></h3>

<p class="c013">My tale, O my lord the Sultan, is marvellous and ’twas as follows.
My father was by profession a schoolmaster and, when he fared to
the ruth of Almighty Allah, I took his place in the school and
taught the boys to read after the fashion of my sire. Now over
the schoolroom was an upper lattice whereto planks had been
nailed and I was ever casting looks at it till one chance day I said
to myself, “By Allah, this lattice thus boarded up needs must
contain hoards or moneys or manuscripts which my father stored
there before his decease; and on such wise I am deprived of them.”
So I arose and brought a ladder and lashed it to another till the
two together reached the lattice and I clomb them holding a
carpenter’s adze<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6817" id="noteref-6817" epub:type="noteref">6817</a> wherewith I prized up the planks until all were
removed. And behold, I then saw a large fowl, to wit, a kite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6818" id="noteref-6818" epub:type="noteref">6818</a>
setting upon her nestlings. But when she saw me she flew
sharply in my face and I was frightened by her and thrown back;
so I tumbled from the ladder-top to the ground and brake both
knee-caps. Then they bore me home and brought a leach to heal
me; but he did me no good and I fell into my present state.
Now this, O our lord the Sultan, proveth the weakness of my wit
and the greatness of my greed; for there is a saw amongst men
that saith “Covetise aye wasteth and never gathereth: so ’ware
thee of covetise.” Such, O lord of the Age and the Time, is my
tale. Hereupon the King bade gifts and largesse be distributed
to the three old schoolmasters, and when his bidding was obeyed
they went their ways. Then the Sultan turned to the Minister
and said, “O Wazir, now respecting the matter of the three
maidens and their mother, I would have thee make enquiry and
find out their home and bring them hither; or let us go to them
in disguise and hear their history, for indeed it must be wonderful.
Otherwise how could they have understood that we served them
that sleight by marking their door and they on their part set
marks of like kind upon all the doors of the quarter that we
might lose the track and touch of them. By Allah, this be rare
intelligence on the part of these damsels: but we, O Wazir, will
strive to come upon their traces.” Then the Minister fared forth,
after changing his dress and demeanour, and walked to the quarter
in question, but found all the doors similarly marked. So he was
sore perplext concerning his case and fell to questioning all the
folk wont to pass by these doors but none could give him any
information; and he walked about sore distraught until eventide,
when he returned to the Sultan without aught of profit. As he
went in to the presence, his liege lord asked him saying, “What
bringest thou of tidings?” and he answered, “O King, I have not
found the property,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6819" id="noteref-6819" epub:type="noteref">6819</a> but there passed through my mind a stratagem
which, an we carry it out, peradventure shall cause us to happen
upon the maidens.” Quoth the Sultan, “What be that?” and quoth
he, “Do thou write me an autograph-writ and give it to the Crier
that he may cry about the city:—Whoso lighteth wick after supper-tide
shall have his head set under his heels.” The Sultan rejoined,
“This thy rede is right.” Accordingly, on the next day the King
wrote his letter and gave it to the Crier bidding him fare through
the city and forbid the lighting of lamps after night-prayers; and
the man took the royal rescript and set it in a green bag. Then
he went forth and cried about the street saying, “According to the
commandment of our King, the Lord of prosperity and Master
of the necks of God’s servants, if any light wick after night-prayers
his head shall be set under his heels, his good shall be
spoiled and his women shall be cast into jail.” And the Crier
stinted not crying through the town during the first day and the
second and the third, until he had gone round the whole place;
nor was there a citizen but who knew the ordinance. Now the
King waited patiently till after the proclamation of the third day;
but on the fourth night he and his Minister went down from the
palace in disguise after supper-tide to pry about the wards and
espy into the lattices of the several quarters. They found no light
till they came to the ward where the three damsels lived, and the
Sultan, happening to glance in such a direction, saw the gleam of
a lamp in one of the tenements. So he said to the Wazir, “Ho!
there is a wick alight.” Presently they drew near it and found
that it was within one of the marked houses; wherefore they came
to a stand and knocked at the door,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King,
the director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when
the Sultan and the Wazir stood over against the door behind
which was the light and knocked at it, the youngest of the sisters
cried out, “Who is at the door?” and they replied, “Guests and
Darwayshes.” She rejoined, “What can you want at this hour
and what can have belated you?” And they, “We be men living
in a Khan; but we have lost our way thither and we fear to
happen upon the Chief of Police. So of your bountiful kindness
open ye to us and house us for the remnant of the night; and
such charity shall gain you reward in Heaven.” Hereto the
mother added, “Go open to them the door!” and the youngest
of the maidens came forward and opened to them and admitted
them. Then the parent and her children rose up and welcomed
them respectfully and seated them and did them honour and set
before them somewhat of food which they ate and were gladdened.
Presently the King said, “O damsels, ye cannot but know that
the Sultan proclaimed forbiddal of wick-burning; but ye have
lighted your lamps and have not obeyed him when all the citizens
have accepted his commandment.” Upon this the youngest
sister accosted him saying, “O Darwaysh, verily the Sultan’s
order should not be obeyed save in commandments which be
reasonable; but this his proclamation forbidding lights is sinful to
accept; and indeed the right direction<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6820" id="noteref-6820" epub:type="noteref">6820</a> wherein man should walk
is according to Holy Law which saith, ‘No obedience to the
creature in a matter of sin against the Creator.’ The Sultan
(Allah make him prevail!) herein acteth against the Law and
imitateth the doings of Satan. For we be three sisters with our
mother, making four in the household, and every night we sit
together by lamp-light and weave a half-pound weight of linen
web<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6821" id="noteref-6821" epub:type="noteref">6821</a> which our mother taketh in the morning for sale to the
Bazar and buyeth us therewith half a pound of raw flax and
with the remainder what sufficeth us of victual.” The Sultan
now turned to his Minister and said, “O Wazir, this damsel
astonisheth me by her questions and answers. What case of
casuistry can we propose to her and what disputation can we set
up? Do thou contrive us somewhat shall pose and perplex her.”
“O my lord,” replied the Wazir, “we are here in the guise of Darwayshes
and are become to these folk as guests: how then can
we disturb them with troublesome queries in their own home?”
Quoth the Sultan, “Needs must thou address them;” so the
Wazir said to the girl, “O noble one, obedience to the royal
orders is incumbent upon you as upon all lieges.” Said she,
“True, he is our Sovran; but how can he know whether we be
starving or full-fed?” “Let us see,” rejoined the Wazir, “when
he shall send for you and set you before the presence and question
you concerning your disobeying his orders, what thou wilt say?”
She retorted, “I would say to the Sultan:——Thou hast contraried
Holy Law.” At this the Minister resumed, “An he ask
thee sundry questions wilt thou answer them?” and she replied,
“Indeed I will.” Hereat the Minister turned to the King and
said, “Let us leave off question and answer with this maiden on
points of conscience and Holy Law and ask if she understand
the fine arts.” Presently the Sultan put the question when she
replied, “How should I not understand them when I am their
father and their mother?” Quoth he, “Allah upon thee, O my
lady, an thou wouldst favour us, let us hear one of thine airs
and its words.” So she rose and retired but presently returning
with a lute sat down and set it upon her lap and ordered the
strings and smote it with a masterly touch: then she fell to
singing amongst other verses these ordered couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Do thou good to men and so rule their necks: ✿ Long reigns who by benefit rules mankind:</div>
      <div class="line">And lend aid to him who for aidance hopes: ✿ For aye grateful is man with a noble mind</div>
      <div class="line">Who brings money the many to him will incline ✿ And money for tempting of man was designed:</div>
      <div class="line">Who hindereth favour and bounties, ne’er ✿ Or brother or friend in creation shall find:</div>
      <div class="line">With harsh looks frown not in the Sage’s face; ✿ Disgusteth the freeman denial unkind:</div>
      <div class="line">Who frequenteth mankind all of good unknow’th: ✿ Man is lief of rebellion, of largesse loath.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the Sultan heard these couplets, his mind was distraught
and he was perplext in thought; then turning to his Wazir, he
said, “By Allah, these lines were surely an examination of and
an allusion to our two selves; and doubtless she weeteth of us
that I am the Sultan and thou art the Wazir, for the whole tenor
of her talk proveth her knowledge of us.” Then he turned to the
maiden and said, “Right good are thy verse and thy voice, and
thy words have delighted us with exceeding delight.” Upon this
she sang the following two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Men seek for them sorrow, and toil ✿ Thro’ long years as they brightly flow;</div>
      <div class="line">But Fate, in the well like the tank<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6822" id="noteref-6822" epub:type="noteref">6822</a> ✿ Firm-fixt, ruleth all below.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now as soon as the Sultan heard these last two couplets he
made certain that the damsel was aware of his quality. She did
not leave off her lute-playing till near daylight, when she rose and
retired and presently brought in a breakfast befitting her degree
(for indeed she was pleased with them); and when she had
served it up they ate a small matter which sufficed them. After
this she said, “Inshallah, you will return to us this night before
supper-tide and become our guests;” and the twain went their
ways marvelling at the beauty of the sisters and their loveliness
and their fearlessness in the matter of the proclamation; and
the Sultan said to the Wazir, “By Allah, my soul inclineth unto
that maiden.” And they stinted not walking until they had
entered the palace. But when that day had gone by and evening
drew nigh, the Monarch made ready to go, he and the Minister,
to the dwelling of the damsels——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive.” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King and
the Councillor made ready to go to the dwelling of the damsels
taking with them somewhat of gold pieces, the time being half an
hour after set of sun; and presently they repaired to the house of
the sisters whither they had been invited on the past night. So
they rapped at the door when the youngest maiden came to it and
opened and let them in: then she salam’d to them and greeted
them and entreated them with increased respect saying, “Welcome
to our lords the Darwayshes.” But she eyed them with the eye of
the physiognomist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6823" id="noteref-6823" epub:type="noteref">6823</a> and said in herself, “Verily these two men are
on no wise what they seem and, unless my caution and intelligence
and power of knowledge have passed away from me, this must be
the Sultan and that his Wazir, for grandeur and majesty are evident
on them.” Then she seated them and accosted them even
more pleasantly and set before them supper, and when they had
eaten enough, she brought basins and ewers for handwashing and
served up coffee causing them to enjoy themselves and to give and
take in talk till their pleasure was perfect. At the time of night-orisons
they arose and, after performing the Wuzú-ablution, prayed,
and when their devotions were ended the Sultan hent in hand his
purse and gave it to the youngest sister saying, “Expend ye this
upon your livelihood.” She took the bag which held two thousand
dinars and kissed his right hand, feeling yet the more convinced
that he must be the Sultan: so she proved her respect by the fewness
of her words as she stood between his hands to do him service.
Also she privily winked at her sisters and mother and said to them
by signs, “Verily this be the Monarch and that his Minister.” The
others then arose and followed suit as the sister had done, when
the Sultan turned to the Wazir and said, “The case is changed:
assuredly they have comprehended it and ascertained it;” presently
adding to the girl, “O damsel, we be only Darwaysh folk and yet
you all stand up in our service as if we were sovrans. I beseech
you do not on this wise.” But the youngest sister again came
forwards and kissed the ground before him and blessed him and
recited this couplet:</p>

this?” and she answered, “From your grand demeanour and your
majestic mien; for such be the qualities of Kings which cannot

but, tell me, how happeneth it that you wone here without men

wondrous and were it graven with graver-needles upon the eye-corners

<h3 class="c012"><em>STORY OF THE THREE SISTERS AND THEIR MOTHER.</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6825" id="noteref-6825" epub:type="noteref">6825</a></h3>

<p class="c013">I and my sisters and my mother are not natives of this city but of
a capital in the land Al-Irák where my father was Sovran having
troops and guards, Wazirs and Eunuch-chamberlains; and my
mother was the fairest woman of her time insomuch that her
beauty was a proverb throughout each and every region. Now it
chanced that when I and my sisters were but infants, our father
would set out to hunt and course and slay beasts of raven and
take his pleasure in the gardens without the city. So he sent for
his Wazir and appointed and constituted him Viceregent in his
stead with full authority to command and be gracious to his lieges:
then he got him ready and marched forth and the Viceroy entered
upon his office. But it happened that it was the hot season and
my mother betook herself to the terrace-roof of the palace in
order to smell the air and sniff up the breeze. At that very hour,
by the decree of the Decreer, the Wazir was sitting in the Kiosk
or roofed balcony hanging to his upper mansion and holding in
hand a mirror; and, as he looked therein, he saw the reflection of
my mother, a glance of eyes which bequeathed him a thousand
sighs. He was forthright distracted by her beauty and loveliness
and fell sick and took to his pillow. Presently a confidential
nurse came in and feeling his pulse, which showed no malady, said
to him, “No harm for thee! thou shalt soon be well nor ever suffer
from aught of sorrow.” Quoth he, “O my nurse, canst thou keep
a secret?” and quoth she, “I can.” Then he told her all the love
he had conceived for my mother and she replied, “This be a light
affair nor hath it aught of hindrance: I will manage for thee such
matter and I will soon unite thee with her.” Thereupon he packed
up for her some of the most sumptuous dresses in his treasury and
said, “Hie thee to her and say:——The Wazir hath sent these to
thee by way of love-token and his desire is either that thou come
to him and converse, he and thou, for a couple of hours,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6826" id="noteref-6826" epub:type="noteref">6826</a> or that
he be allowed to visit thee.” The nurse replied with “Hearkening
and obedience,” and fared forth and found my mother (and
we little ones were before her) all unknowing aught of that
business. So the old woman saluted her and brought forwards the
dresses, and my mother arose and opening the bundle beheld
sumptuous raiment and, amongst other valuables, a necklace of
precious stones. So she said to the nurse, “This is indeed ornamental
gear, especially the collar;” and said the nurse, “O my lady,
these are from thy slave the Wazir by way of love-token, for he
doteth on thee with extreme desire and his only wish is to forgather
with thee and converse, he and thou, for a couple of hours,
either in his own place or in thine whither he will come.” Now
when my mother heard these words from the nurse she arose and
drew a scymitar which lay hard by and of her angry hastiness
made the old woman’s head fall from her body and bade her slave
girls pick up the pieces and cast them into the common privy of
the palace. So they did her bidding and wiped away the blood.
Now the Wazir abode expecting his nurse to return to him but she
returned not; so next day he despatched another handmaid who
went to my mother and said to her, “O my lady, our lord the
Wazir sent thee a present of dress by his nurse; but she hath
not come back to him.” Hereupon my mother bade her Eunuchs
take the slave and strangle her, then cast the corpse into the
same house of easement where they had thrown the nurse. They
did her bidding; but she said in her mind, “Haply the Wazir will
return from the road of unright:” and she kept his conduct a
secret. He however fell every day to sending slave-girls with the
same message and my mother to slaying each and every, nor
deigned show him any signs of yielding. But she, O our lord the
Sultan, still kept her secret and did not acquaint our father therewith,
always saying to herself, “Haply the Wazir will return to
the road of right.” And behold my father presently came back
from hunting and sporting and pleasuring, when the Lords of the
land met him and salam’d to him, and amongst them appeared
the Minister whose case was changed. Now some years after this,
O King of the Age, our sire resolved upon a Pilgrimage to the
Holy House of Meccah——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O
sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable.” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youngest
sister continued to the Sultan:——So our sire, O King of the
Age, resolved upon a Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah
and stablished the same Wazir Viceregent in his stead to deal commandment
and break off and carry out. So he said in his heart,
“Now have I won my will of the Sultan’s Harem.” So the King
gat him ready and fared forth to Allah’s Holy House after committing
us to the charge of his Minister. But when he had been
gone ten days, and the Wazir knew that he must be far from the
city where he had left behind him me and my sisters and my
mother, behold, an Eunuch of the Minister’s came in to us and
kissed ground before the Queen and said to her “Allah upon thee,
O my lady, pity my lord the Wazir, for his heart is melted by
thy love and his wits wander and his right mind; and he is now
become as one annihilated. So do thou have ruth upon him and
revive his heart and restore his health.” Now when my mother
heard these words, she bade her Eunuchs seize that Castrato and
carry him from the room to the middle of the Divan-court and
there slay him; but she did so without divulging her reasons.
They obeyed her bidding; and when the Lords of the land and
others saw the body of a man slain by the eunuchry of the palace,
they informed the Wazir, saying, “What hateful business is this
which hath befallen after the Sultan’s departure?” He asked,
“What is to do?” and they told him that his Castrato had been
slain by a party of the palace eunuchry. Thereupon he said to
them, “In your hand abideth testimony of this whenas the Sultan
shall return and ye shall bear witness to it.” But, O King, the
Wazir’s passion for our mother waxed cool after the deaths of the
nurse and the slave-girls and the eunuch; and she also held her peace
and spake not a word there anent. On this wise time passed
and he sat in the stead of my sire till the Sultan’s return drew near
when the Minister dreaded lest our father, learning his ill deeds,
should do him die. So he devised a device and wrote a letter to
the King saying:——“After salutation be it known to thee that
thy Harem hath sent to me, not only once but five several times
during thine absence, soliciting of me a foul action, to which I
refused consent and replied, By Allah, however much she may
wish to betray my Sovran, I by the Almighty will not turn traitor;
for that I was left by thee guardian of the realm after thy
departure.” He added words upon words; then he sealed the
scroll and gave it to a running courier with orders to hurry along
the road. The messenger took it and fared with it to the Sultan’s
camp when distant eight days’ journey from the capital; and,
finding him seated in his pavilion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6827" id="noteref-6827" epub:type="noteref">6827</a> delivered the writ. He took
it and opened it and read it and when he understood its secret
significance, his face changed, his eyes turned backwards and he
bade his tents be struck for departure. So they fared by
forced marches till between him and his capital remained only
two stations. He then summoned two Chamberlains with orders
to forego him to the city and take my mother and us three girls
a day’s distance from it and there put us to death. Accordingly,
they led us four to the open country purposing to kill us, and my
mother knew not what intent was in their minds until they reached
the appointed spot. Now the Queen had in times past heaped
alms-deeds and largesse upon the two Chamberlains, so they held
the case to be a grievous and said each to other, “By Allah we
cannot slaughter them; no, never!” Then they told my mother
of the letter which the Wazir had written to our father saying such-and-such, upon which she exclaimed, “He hath lied, by Allah, the
arch-traitor; and naught happened save so-and-so.” Then she
related to them all she had done with the exactest truth. The
men said, “Sooth thou hast spoken;” then arising without stay or
delay they snared a gazelle and slaughtered it and filled with its
blood four flasks; after which they broiled some of the flesh over
the embers and gave it to my mother that we might satisfy our
hunger. Presently they farewelled us saying, “We give you in
charge of Him who never disappointed those committed to His
care;” and, lastly, they went their ways leaving us alone in the
wild and the wold. So we fell to eating the desert-grasses and
drinking of the remnants of the rain, and we walked awhile and rested
awhile without finding any city or inhabited region; and we waxed
tired, O King of the Age, when suddenly we came upon a spot on
a hill-flank abounding in vari-coloured herbs and fair fountains.
Here we abode ten days and behold, a caravan drew near us and
encamped hard by us, but they did not sight us for that we hid
ourselves from their view until night fell. Then I went to them
and asked of sundry eunuchs and ascertained that there was a city
at the distance of two days’ march from us; so I returned and
informed my mother who rejoiced at the good tidings. As soon
as it was morn the caravan marched off, so we four arose and
walked all that day through at a leisurely pace, and a second day
and so forth; until, on the afternoon of the fifth, a city rose before
our sight fulfilling all our desires<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6828" id="noteref-6828" epub:type="noteref">6828</a> and we exclaimed, “Alhamdolillah,
laud be to the Lord who hath empowered us to reach it.”
We ceased not faring till sunset when we entered it and we found
it a potent capital. Such was our case and that of our mother;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6829" id="noteref-6829" epub:type="noteref">6829</a>
but as regards our sire the Sultan, as he drew near his home after
the return-journey from the Hajj, the Lords of the land and the
Chiefs of the city flocked out to meet him, and the town-folk
followed one another like men riding on pillions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6830" id="noteref-6830" epub:type="noteref">6830</a> to salute him, and
the poor and the mesquin congratulated him on his safety and at
last the Wazir made his appearance. The Sultan desired to be
private with the Minister——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O
sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate to you on
the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Sixty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King
desired to be private with the Minister and when they were left
alone he said, “O Wazir, how was it between thee and that Harim
of mine?” Said the other, “O King of the Age, she sent to me
not only once but five several times and I refrained from her and
whatsoever eunuch she despatched I slew, saying, Haply she may
cease so doing and abandon her evil intent. But she did not
repent, so I feared for thine honour and sent to acquaint thee with
the matter.” The Sultan bowed his head groundwards for a while,
then raising it he bade summon the two Chamberlains whom he
had sent to slay his wife and three children. On their appearing
he asked them, “What have you done in fulfilling my commandment?”
They answered, “We did that which thou badest
be done,” and showed him the four flasks they had filled
with the blood and said, “This be their blood, a flask-full from
each.” The Sultan hent them in hand and mused over what had
taken place between him and his wife of love and affection and
union; so he wept with bitter weeping and fell down in a fainting
fit. After an hour or so he recovered and turning to the Wazir
said, “Tell me, hast thou spoken sooth?” and the other replied,
“Yes, I have.” Then the Sultan addressed the two Chamberlains
and asked them, “Have ye put to death my daughters with their
mother?” But they remained silent nor made aught of answer or
address. So he exclaimed, “What is on your minds that ye speak
not?” They rejoined, “By Allah, O King of the Age, the honest
man cannot tell an untruth for that lying and leasing are the
characteristics of hypocrites and traitors.” When the Wazir heard
the Chamberlains’ speech his colour yellowed, his frame was disordered
and a trembling seized his limbs, and the King turned to
him and noted that these symptoms had been caused by the words
of the two officials. So he continued to them, “What mean ye,
O Chamberlains, by your saying that lies and leasing are the
characteristics of hypocrites and traitors? Can it be that ye have
not put them to death? And as ye claim to be true men either
ye have killed them and ye speak thus or you are liars. Now by
Him who hath set me upon the necks of His lieges, if ye declare
not to me the truth I will do you both die by the foulest of deaths.”
They rejoined, “By Allah, O King of the Age, whenas thou badest
us take them and slay them, we obeyed thy bidding and they knew
not nor could they divine what was to be until we arrived with
them at the middlemost and broadest of the desert; and when we
informed them of what had been done by the Wazir, thy Harem
exclaimed:——There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
Allah, the Glorious, the Great. Verily we are Allah’s and unto
Him are we returning. But an ye kill us you will kill us wrongfully
and ye wot not wherefor. By the Lord, this Wazir hath foully
lied and hath accused us falsely before the Almighty. So we said to
her, O King of the Age:——Inform us of what really took place; and
said the mother of the Princesses:——Thus and thus it happened.
Then she fell to telling us the whole tale from first to last of the
nurse who was sent to her and the handmaids and the Eunuch.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6831" id="noteref-6831" epub:type="noteref">6831</a>
Hereupon the Sultan cried, “And ye, have ye slain them or not?”
and the Chamberlains replied, “By Allah, O King of the Age,
whenas the loyalty of thy Harem was made manifest to us we
snared a gazelle and cut its throat and filled these four flasks with
its blood; after which we broiled some of the flesh upon the
embers and offered it to thy Harem and her children saying to
them:——We give thee in charge to Him who never disappointeth
those committed to His care, and we added, Your truth shall
save you. Lastly we left them in the midmost of the waste and
we returned hither.” When the Sultan heard these words he turned
to the Wazir and exclaimed, “Thou hast estranged from me my
wife and my children;” but the Minister uttered not a word nor
made any address and trembled in every limb like one afflicted with
an ague. And when the King saw the truth of the Chamberlains
and the treachery of the Minister he bade fuel be collected and set
on fire and they did his bidding. Then he commanded them to
truss up the Wazir, hand tied to foot, and bind him perforce upon
a catapult<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6832" id="noteref-6832" epub:type="noteref">6832</a> and cast him into the middle of the fiery pyre which
made his bones melt before his flesh. Lastly he ordered his palace
to be pillaged, his good to be spoiled and the women of his Harem
to be sold for slaves. After this he said to the Chamberlains,
“You must know the spot wherein you left the Queen and
Princesses;” and said they, “O King of the Age, we know it
well; but when we abandoned them and returned home they were
in the midst of the wolds and the wilds nor can we say what befel
them or whether they be now alive or dead.” On this wise fared
it with them; but as regards us three maidens and our mother, when
we entered the city——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable?” Quoth she, “And where is
this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the
next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the youngest
sister continued her tale:——So when we three maidens and our
mother entered the city about sunset I the youngest said to them,
“We be three Princesses and a Queen-mother: so we cannot show
ourselves in this our condition and needs must we lodge us in a
Khan: also ’tis my rede that we should do best by donning boys’
dress. All agreeing hereto we did accordingly and, entering a
Caravanserai, hired us a retired chamber in one of the wings.
Now every day we three fared forth to service and at eventide we
forgathered and took what sufficed us of sustenance; but our
semblance had changed with the travails of travel and all who
looked at us would say, These be lads. In this plight we passed
the space of a year full-told till, one day of the days, we three
fared forth to our chares, as was our wont, and behold, a young
man met us upon the way and turning to me asked, “O lad, wilt
thou serve in my house?”” Quoth I, “O my uncle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6833" id="noteref-6833" epub:type="noteref">6833</a> I must ask
advice,” and quoth he, “O my lad, crave counsel of thy mother
and come and serve in our home.” He then looked at my sisters
and enquired, “Be these thy comrades, O lad?” and I replied
“No, they are my brothers.” So we three went to our mother in
the Khan and said to her, “This young man wisheth to hire the
youngest of us for service,” and said she, “No harm in that.”
Thereupon the youth arose and taking me by the hand guided me
to his home and led me in to his mother and his wife, and when
the ancient dame saw me, her heart was opened to me. Presently
quoth the young man to his parent, “I have brought the lad to
serve in our house and he hath two brothers and his mother
dwelling with them.” Quoth she, “May it be fortunate to thee,
O my son.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6834" id="noteref-6834" epub:type="noteref">6834</a> So I tarried there serving them till sunset and when
the evening-meal was eaten, they gave me a dish of meat and three
large bannocks of clean bread. These I took and carried to my
mother whom I found sitting with my sisters and I set before them
the meat and bread; but when my parent saw this she wept with
sore weeping and cried, “Time hath overlooked us; erst we gave
food to the folk and now the folk send us food.” And cried I,
“Marvel not at the works of the Creator; for verily Allah hath
ordered for us this and for others that and the world endureth not
for any one;” and I ceased not soothing my mother’s heart till it
waxed clear of trouble and we ate and praised Almighty Allah.
Now every day I went forth to serve at the young man’s house and
at eventide bore to my mother and sisters their sufficiency of food
for supper,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6835" id="noteref-6835" epub:type="noteref">6835</a> breakfast and dinner; and when the youth brought
eatables of any kind for me I would distribute it to the family.
And he looked well after our wants and at times he would supply
clothing for me and for the youths, my sisters, and for my parent;
so that all hearts in our lodgings were full of affection for him. At
last his mother said, “What need is there for the lad to go forth
from us every eventide and pass the night with his people? Let
him lie in our home and every day about afternoon-time carry the
evening meal to his mother and brothers and then return to us and
keep me company.” I replied, “O my lady, let me consult my
mother, to whom I will fare forthright and acquaint her herewith.”
But my parent objected saying, “O my daughter, we fear lest thou
be discovered and they find thee out to be a girl.” I replied,
“Our Lord will veil our secret;” and she rejoined, “Then do thou
obey them.” So I lay with the young man’s mother nor did any
divine that I was a maid, albeit from the time when I entered into
that youth’s service my strength and comeliness had increased.
At last, one night of the nights, I went after supper to sleep at my
employer’s and the young man’s mother chanced to glance in my
direction when she saw my loosed hair which gleamed and
glistened many-coloured as a peacock’s robe. Next morning I
arose and gathering up my locks donned the Tákiyah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6836" id="noteref-6836" epub:type="noteref">6836</a> and proceeded,
as usual, to do service about the house never suspecting
that the mother had taken notice of my hair. Presently she said
to her son, “’Tis my wish that thou buy me a few rose-blossoms
which be fresh.” He asked, “To make conserve?” and she
answered, “No.” Then he enquired; “Wherefore wantest thou
roses?” and she replied, “By Allah, O my son, I wish therewith
to try this our servant whom I suspect to be a girl and no boy;
and under him in bed I would strew rose-leaves, for an they be
found wilted in the morning he is a lad, and if they remain as they
were he is a lass.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6837" id="noteref-6837" epub:type="noteref">6837</a> So he fared forth and presently returned to
his mother with the rose-blossoms; and, when the sleeping-hour
came, she went and placed them in my bed. I slept well and in
the morning when I arose she came to me and found that the
petals had not changed for the worse; nay, they had gained lustre.
So she made sure that I was a girl.——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Seventieth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the damsel
continued:——So the young man’s mother made certain that her
servant lad was a virgin lass. But she concealed her secret from
her son and was kind to me and showed me respect and, of the
goodness of her heart, sent me back early to my mother and sisters.
Now one day of the days the youth came home about noon as was
his wont; and he found me with sleeves tucked up to the elbows
engaged in washing a bundle of shirts and turbands; and I was
careless of myself so he drew near me and noted my cheeks that
flushed rosy red and eyes which were as those of the thirsty
gazelle and my scorpion locks hanging adown my side face. This
took place in summertide; and when he saw me thus his wits
were distraught and his sound senses were as naught and his judgment
was in default: so he went in to his parent and said to her,
“O my mother, indeed this servant is no boy, but a maiden girl
and my wish is that thou discover for me her case and make
manifest to me her condition and marry me to her, for that my
heart is fulfilled of her love.” Now by the decree of the Decreer
I was privily listening to all they said of me; so presently I arose,
after washing the clothes and what else they had given me; but
my state was changed by their talk and I knew and felt certified
that the youth and his mother had recognised me for a girl. I
continued on this wise till eventide when I took the food and
returned to my family and they all ate till they had eaten enough,
when I told them my adventure and my conviction. So my mother
said to me, “What remaineth for us now to do?” and said I, “O my
mother, let us arise, we three, before night shall set in and go forth
ere they lock the Khan upon us;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6838" id="noteref-6838" epub:type="noteref">6838</a> and if the door-keeper ask us
aught let us answer:—We are faring to spend the night in the
house of the youth where our son is serving.” My mother replied,
“Right indeed is thy rede.” Accordingly, all four of us went forth
at the same time and when the porter asked, “This is night-tide
and whither may ye be wending?” we answered, “We have been
invited by the young man whom our son serveth for he maketh a
Septena-festival<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6839" id="noteref-6839" epub:type="noteref">6839</a> and a bridal-feast: so we purpose to night with
him and return a-morn.” Quoth he, “There is no harm in that.
So we issued out and turned aside and sought the waste lands, the
Veiler veiling us, and we ceased not walking till the day brake and
we were sore a-wearied. Then we sat for rest till the rise of sun and
when it shone we four sprang up and strave with our wayfare
throughout the first day and the second and the third until the
seventh. (Now all this was related to Mohammed the Sultan of
Cairo and his Wazir by the youngest Princess and they abode
wondering at her words.) On the seventh day we reached this city
and here we housed ourselves; but to this hour we have no news of
our sire after the Minister was burnt nor do we know an he be whole
or dead. Yet we yearn for him: so do thou, of thine abundant
favour, O King of the Age, and thy perfect beneficence, send a
messenger to seek tidings of him and to acquaint him with our case,
when he will send to fetch us.” Here she ceased speaking and the
Monarch and Minister both wondered at her words and exclaimed,
“Exalted be He who decreeth to His servants severance and reunion.”
Then the Sultan of Cairo arose without stay or delay
and wrote letters to the King of Al-Irák, the father of the damsels,
telling him that he had taken them under his safeguard, them and
their mother, and gave the writ to the Shaykh of the Cossids<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6840" id="noteref-6840" epub:type="noteref">6840</a> and
appointed for it a running courier and sent him forth with it to
the desert. After this the King took the three maidens and their
mother and carried them to his Palace where he set apart for them
an apartment and he appointed for them what sufficed of appointments.
Now, as for the Cossid who fared forth with the letter, he
stinted not spanning the waste for the space of two months until
he made the city of the bereaved King of Al-Irák, and when
he asked for the royal whereabouts they pointed out to him a
pleasure-garden. So he repaired thither and went in to him,
kissed ground before him, offered his services, prayed for him and
lastly handed to him the letter. The King took it and brake the
seal and opened the scroll; but when he read it and comprehended
its contents, he rose up and shrieked a loud shriek and fell to the
floor in a fainting fit. So the high officials flocked around him
and raised him from the ground, and when he recovered after an
hour or so they questioned him concerning the cause of this. He
then related to them the adventures of his wife and children; how
they were still in the bonds of life whole and hearty; and forthright
he ordered a ship to be got ready for them and stored therein
gifts and presents for him who had been the guardian of his Queen
and her daughters. But he knew not what lurked for them in the
future. So the ship sailed away, all on board seeking the desired
city, and she reached it without delay, the winds blowing light and
fair. Then she fired the cannon of safe arrival<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6841" id="noteref-6841" epub:type="noteref">6841</a> and the Sultan
sent forth to enquire concerning her,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to you
on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now
when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan made enquiries
concerning that ship, when behold! the Rais<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6842" id="noteref-6842" epub:type="noteref">6842</a> came forth her to
the land and accosting the King handed to him the letter and
acquainted him with the arrival of the gifts and presents. Whereupon
he bade all on board her come ashore and be received in the
guest-house for a space of three days until the traces of travel
should disappear from them. After that time the Sultan gat ready
whatso became his high degree of offerings evening those despatched
to him by the father of the damsels and stowed them in the vessel,
where he also embarked as much of victual and provaunt as might
suffice for all the voyagers. On the fourth day after sunset the
damsels and their mother were borne on board and likewise went
the master after they had taken leave of the King and had
salam’d to him and prayed for his preservation. Now in early
morning the breeze blew free and fair so they loosed sail and made
for the back<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6843" id="noteref-6843" epub:type="noteref">6843</a> of the sea and voyaged safely for the first day and
the second. But on the third about mid-afternoon a furious gale
came out against them; whereby the sails were torn to tatters and
the masts fell overboard: so the crew made certain of death, and
the ship ceased not to be tossed upwards and to settle down
without mast or sail till midnight, all the folk lamenting one to
other, as did the maidens and their mother, till the wreck was
driven upon an island and there went to pieces. Then he whose
life-term was short died forthright and he whose life-term was long
survived; and some bestrode planks and others butts and others
again bulks of timber whereby all were separated each from other.
Now the mother and two of the daughters clomb upon planks they
chanced find and sought their safety; but the youngest of the
maidens who had mounted a keg,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6844" id="noteref-6844" epub:type="noteref">6844</a> and who knew nothing of her
mother and sisters, was carried up and cast down by the waves for
the space of five days till she landed upon an extensive seaboard
where she found a sufficiency to eat and drink. She sat down
upon the shore for an hour of time until she had taken rest and
her heart was calmed and her fear had flown and she had recovered
her spirits: then she rose and paced the sands, all unknowing
whither she should wend, and whenever she came upon aught of
herbs she would eat of them. This lasted through the first day
and the second till the forenoon of the third, when lo and behold!
a Knight advanced towards her, falcon on fist and followed by a
greyhound. For three days he had been wandering about the
waste questing game either of birds or of beasts, but he happened
not upon either when he chanced to meet the maiden, and seeing
her said in his mind, “By Allah, yon damsel is my quarry this
very day.” So he drew near her and salam’d to her and she
returned his salute; whereupon he asked her of her condition and
she informed him of what had betided her; and his heart was
softened towards her and taking her up on his horse’s crupper he
turned him homewards. Now of this youngest sister (quoth
Shahrazad) there is much to say, and we will say it when the tale
shall require the telling. But as regards the second Princess, she
ceased not floating on the plank for the space of eight days, until
she was borne by the set of the sea close under the walls of a
city: but she was like one drunken with wine when she crawled up
the shore and her raiment was in rags and her colour had wanned
for excess of affright. However, she walked onwards at a slow
pace till she reached the city and came upon a house of low stone
walls. So she went in and there finding an ancient dame sitting
and spinning yarn, she gave her good evening and the other
returned it adding, “Who art thou, O my daughter, and whence
comest thou?” She answered, “O my aunt, I’m fallen from the
skies and have been met by the earth: thou needest not question
me of aught, for my heart is clean molten by the fire of grief.
An thou take me in for love and kindness ’tis well and if not I
will again fare forth on my wanderings.” When the old woman
heard these words she compassioned the maiden and her heart
felt tender towards her, and she cried, “Welcome to thee, O my
daughter, sit thee down!” Accordingly she sat her down beside
her hostess and the two fell to spinning yarn whereby to gain
their daily bread: and the old dame rejoiced in her and said,
“She shall take the place of my daughter.” Now of this second
Princess (quoth Shahrazad) there is much to say and we will say
it when the tale shall require the telling. But as regards the eldest
sister, she ceased not clinging to the plank and floating over the
sea till the sixth day passed, and on the seventh she was cast upon
a stead where lay gardens distant from the town six miles. So
she walked into them and seeing fruit close-clustering she took
of it and ate and donned the cast-off dress of a man she found
nearhand. Then she kept on faring till she entered the town and
here she fell to wandering about the Bazars till she came to the
shop of a Kunáfah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6845" id="noteref-6845" epub:type="noteref">6845</a>-maker who was cooking his vermicelli; and
he, seeing a fair youth in man’s habit, said to her, “O younker,
wilt thou be my servant?” “O my uncle,” she said, “I will
well;” so he settled her wage each day a quarter farthing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6846" id="noteref-6846" epub:type="noteref">6846</a> not
including her diet. Now in that town were some fifteen shops
wherein Kunafah was made. She abode with the confectioner the
first day and the second and the third to the full number of ten,
when the traces of travel left her and fear departed from her heart,
and her favour and complexion were changed for the better and
she became even as the moon, nor could any guess that the lad
was a lass. Now it was the practice of that man to buy every
day half a quartern<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6847" id="noteref-6847" epub:type="noteref">6847</a> of flour and use it for making his vermicelli;
but when the so-seeming youth came to him he would lay in each
morning three quarterns; and the townsfolk heard of this change
and fell to saying, “We will never dine without the Kunafah of the
confectioner who hath in his house the youth.” This is what
befel the eldest Princess of whom (quoth Shahrazad) there is much
to say and we will say it when the tale shall require the telling.
But as regards the Queen-mother,——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate
to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”
Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Seventy-second Night,</div>

</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as regards the mother
of the maidens, when the ship broke up under them and she
bestrode the bulk of timber, she came upon the Rais in his boat
manned by three of the men; so he took her on board and they
ceased not paddling for a space of three days when they sighted a
lofty island which fulfilled their desire, and its summit towered high
in air. So they made for it till they drew near it and landed on a
low side-shore where they abandoned their boat; and they ceased
not walking through the rest of that day and those that followed
till one day of the days behold, a dust-cloud suddenly appeared to
them spiring up to the skies. They fared for it and after a while
it lifted, showing beneath it a host with swords glancing and lanceheads
gleams lancing and war steeds dancing and prancing, and
these were ridden by men like unto eagles and the host was under
the hands of a Sultan around whom ensigns and banners were
flying. And when this King saw the Rais and the sailors and the
woman following, he wheeled his charger themwards to learn what
tidings they brought and rode up to the strangers and questioned
them; and the castaways informed them that their ship had broken
up under them. Now the cause of this host’s taking the field was
that the King of Al-Irak, the father of the three maidens, after he
appointed the ship and saw her set out, felt uneasy at heart, presaging
evil, and feared with sore fear the shifts of Time. So he
went forth, he and his high Officials and his host, and marched
adown the longshore till, by decree of the Decreer, he suddenly
and all unexpectedly came upon his Queen who was under charge
of the ship’s captain. Presently, seeing the cavalcade and its ensigns
the Rais went forward and recognising the King hastened up to
him and kissed his stirrup and his feet. The Sultan turned towards
him and knew him; so he asked him of his state and the Rais
answered by relating all that had befallen him. Thereupon the
King commanded his power to alight in that place and they did
so and set up their tents and pavilions. Then the Sultan took
seat in his Shámiyánah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6848" id="noteref-6848" epub:type="noteref">6848</a> and bade them bring his Queen and they
brought her, and when eye met eye the pair greeted each other
fondly and the father asked concerning her three children. She
declared that she had no tidings of them after the shipwreck and
she knew not whether they were dead or alive. Hereat the King
wept with sore weeping and exclaimed, “Verily we are Allah’s
and unto Him we are returning!” after which he gave orders to
march from that place upon his capital. Accordingly they stinted
not faring for a space of four days till they reached the city and he
entered his citadel-palace. But every time and every hour he was
engrossed in pondering the affair of the three Princesses and kept
saying, “Would heaven I wot are they drowned or did they escape
the sea; and, if they were saved, Oh, that I knew whether they
were scattered or abode in company one with other and whatever
else may have betided them!” And he ceased not brooding over
the issue of things and kept addressing himself in speech; and
neither meat was pleasant to him nor drink. Such were his case
and adventure; but as regards the youngest sister whenas she was
met by the Knight and seated upon the crupper of his steed, he
ceased not riding with her till he reached his city and went into his
citadel-palace. Now the Knight was the son of a Sultan who had
lately deceased, but a usurper had seized the reins of rule in his
stead and Time had proved a tyrant to the youth, who had therefore
addicted himself to hunting and sporting. Now by the decree
of the Decreer he had ridden forth to the chase where he met the
Princess and took her up behind him, and at the end of the ride,
when he returned to his mother, he was becharmed by her charms;
so he gave her in charge to his parent and honoured her with the
highmost possible honour and felt for her a growing fondness even
as felt she for him. And when the girl had tarried with them a
month full-told she increased in beauty and loveliness and symmetrical
stature and perfect grace; then, the heart of the youth
was fulfilled with love of her and on like wise was the soul of the
damsel who, in her new affection, forgot her mother and her sisters.
But from the moment that maiden entered his Palace the fortunes
of the young Knight amended and the world waxed propitious to
him nor less did the hearts of the lieges incline to him; so they held
a meeting and said, “There shall be over us no Sovran and no Sultan
save the son of our late King; and he who at this present ruleth
us hath neither great wealth nor just claim to the sovereignty.”
Now all this benefit which accrued to the young King was by the
auspicious coming of the Princess. Presently the case was agreed
upon by all the citizens of the capital that on the morning of the
next day they would make him ruler and depose the usurper.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Seventy-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the citizens
in early morning held a meeting whereat were present the Lords
of the land and the high Officials, and they went in to the usurping
Sultan determined to remove and depose him. But he refused
and forswore consent, saying, “By Allah, such thing may not be
except after battle and slaughter.” Accordingly they fared forth
and acquainted the young King who held the matter grievous and
was overridden by cark and care: however he said to them, “If
there must perforce be fighting and killing, I have treasures
sufficient to levy a host.” So saying he went away and disappeared;
but presently he brought them the moneys which they
distributed to the troops. Then they repaired to the Maydán,
the field of fight outside the city, and on like guise the usurping
Sultan rode out with all his power. And when the two opposing
hosts were ranged in their forces, each right ready for the fray,
the usurper and his men charged home upon the young King
and either side engaged in fierce combat and sore slaughter befel.
But the usurper had the better of the battle and purposed to seize
the young King amidst his many when, lo and behold! appeared
a Knight backing a coal-black mare; and he was armed cap-à-pie
in a coat of mail, and he carried a spear and a mace. With these
he bore down upon the usurper and shore off his right forearm
so that he fell from his destrier, and the Knight seeing this struck
him a second stroke with the sword and parted head from body.
When his army saw the usurper fall, all sought safety in flight
and <i><span xml:lang="fr">sauve qui peut</span></i>; but the army of the young King came up
with them and caused the scymitar to fall upon them so that
were saved of them only those to whom length of life was foreordained.
Hereupon the victors lost no time in gathering the
spoils and the horses together; but the young King stood gazing
at the Knight and considering his prowess; yet he failed to
recognize him and after an hour or so the stranger disappeared
leaving the conqueror sorely chafed and vexed for that he knew
him not and had failed to forgather with him. After this the
young King returned from the battle-field with his band playing
behind him and he entered the seat of his power, and was raised
by the lieges to the station of his sire. Those who had
escaped the slaughter dispersed in all directions and sought safety
in flight and the partizans who had enthroned the young King
thronged around him and gave him joy as also did the general
of the city, whose rejoicings were increased thereby. Now the
coming of the aforesaid Knight was a wondrous matter. When
the rightful King made ready for battle the Princess feared for his
life and, being skilled in the practice of every weapon, she escaped
the notice of the Queen-dowager and after donning her war-garb
and battle-gear she went forth to the stable and saddled her a
mare and mounted her and pushed in between the two armies.
And as soon as she saw the usurper charge down upon the young
King as one determined to shed his life’s blood, she forestalled
him and attacked him and tore out the life from between his ribs.
Then she returned to her apartment nor did any know of the deed
she had done. Presently, when it was eventide the young King
entered the Palace after securing his succession to royalty; but
he was still chafed and vexed for that he knew not the Knight.
His mother met him and gave him joy of his safety and his
accession to the Sultanate, whereto he made reply, “Ah! O my
mother, my length of days was from the hand of a horseman who
suddenly appearing joined us in our hardest stress and aided me
in my straitest need and saved me from Death.” Quoth she, “O
my son, hast thou recognised him?” and quoth he, “’Twas my
best desire to discover him and to stablish him as my Wazir, but
this I failed to do.” Now when the Princess heard these words
she laughed and rejoiced and still laughing said, “To whoso will
make thee acquainted with him what wilt thou give?” and said
he, “Dost thou know him?” So she replied, “I wot him not,”
and he rejoined, “Then what is the meaning of these thy words?”
when she answered him in these prosaic rhymes:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6849" id="noteref-6849" epub:type="noteref">6849</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“O my lord, may I prove thy sacrifice ✿ Nor exult at thy sorrows thine   enemies!</div>

      <div class="line">I’ll carry whatever makes thee complain ✿ And be my body the first that   dies.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he heard these words he again asked, “Dost thou know
him?” and she answered, “He? Verily we wot him not;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6850" id="noteref-6850" epub:type="noteref">6850</a> and
repeated the saying to him a second time: withal he by no means
understood her. So quoth she, “How canst thou administer the
Sultanate and yet fail to comprehend my simple words? For
indeed I have made the case clear to thee.” Hereupon he
fathomed the secret of the saying and flew to her in his joy and
clasped her to his bosom and kissed her upon the cheeks. But
his mother turned to him and said, “O my son, do not on this
wise for everything hath its time and season;”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to
say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Three Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan’s
mother said, “O my son, everything hath its time and season;
and whoso hurrieth a matter before opportunity befit shall be
punished with the loss of it.” But he replied, “By Allah, O my
mother, thy suspicion be misplaced: I acted thus only on my
gratitude to her, for assuredly she is the Knight who came to
my aidance and who saved me from death.” And his mother
excused him. They passed that night in converse and next day
at noontide the King sought the Divan in order to issue his
commandments; but when the assembly filled the room and
became as a garden of bloom the Lords of the land said to him,
“O King of the Age, ’twere not suitable that thou become Sultan
except thou take to thee a wife; and Alhamdolillah—laud to the
Lord who hath set thee on the necks of His servants and who
hath restored the realm to thee as successor of thy sire. There is
no help but that thou marry.” Quoth he, “To hear is to consent,”
then he arose without stay or delay and went in to his mother and
related to her what had happened. Quoth she, “O my son, do
what becometh thee and Allah prosper thy affairs!” He said to
her, “O my mother, retire thou with the maiden and persuade her
to marriage for I want none other and I love not aught save herself,”
and said she, “With joy and gladness.” So he went from
her and she arose and was private with the damsel when she
addressed her, “O my lady, the King desireth to wed thee and he
wanteth none other and he seeketh not aught save thee.” But the
Princess hearing this exclaimed, “How shall I marry, I who have
lost my kith and kin and my dear ones and am driven from my
country and my birth-place? This were a proceeding opposed to
propriety! But if it need must be and I have the fortune to
forgather with my mother and sisters and father, then and then
only it shall take place.” The mother replied, “Why this delay, O
my daughter? The Lords of the land have stood up against the
King in the matter of marriage, and in the absence of espousals
we fear for his deposition. Now maidens be many and their
relations long to see each damsel wedded to my son and become
a Queen in virtue of her husband’s degree: but he wanteth none
other and loveth naught save thyself. Accordingly, an thou
wouldst take compassion on him and protect him by thy consent
from the insistence of the Grandees, deign accept him to mate.”
Nor did the Sultan’s mother cease to speak soothing words to the
maiden and to gentle her with soft language until her mind was
made up and she gave consent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6851" id="noteref-6851" epub:type="noteref">6851</a> Upon this they began to prepare
for the ceremony forthright, and summoned the Kazi and witnesses
who duly knotted the knot of wedlock and by eventide the glad
tidings of the espousals were bruited abroad. The King bade
spread bride-feasts and banqueting tables and invited his high
Officials and the Grandees of the kingdom and he went in to the
maiden that very night and the rejoicings grew in gladness and all
sorrows ceased to deal sadness. Then he proclaimed through the
capital and all the burghs that the lieges should decorate the
streets with rare tapestries and multiform in honour of the
Sultanate. Accordingly, they adorned the thoroughfares in the
city and its suburbs for forty days and the rejoicings increased
when the King fed the widows and the Fakirs and the mesquin
and scattered gold and robed and gifted and largessed till all the
days of decoration were gone by. On this wise the sky of his
estate grew clear by the loyalty of the lieges and he gave orders
to deal justice after the fashion of the older Sultans, to wit, the
Chosroes and the Cæsars; and this condition endured for three
years, during which Almighty Allah blessed him by the Princess
with two men-children as they were moons. Such was the case
with the youngest Princess; but as regards the cadette, the second
sister,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as regards the
case of the cadette, the second damsel, when she was adopted to
daughter by the ancient dame she fell to spinning with her and
living by the work of their hands. Now there chanced to govern
that city a Báshá<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6852" id="noteref-6852" epub:type="noteref">6852</a> who had sickened with a sore sickness till he was
near unto death; and the wise men and leaches had compounded
for him of medicines a mighty matter which, however, availed him
naught. At last the tidings came to the ears of the Princess who
lived with the old woman and she said to her, “O my mother, I
desire to prepare a tasse of broth and do thou bear it to the Basha
and let him drink of it; haply will Almighty Allah vouchsafe him
a cure whereby we shall gain some good.” Said the other, “O my
daughter, and how shall I obtain admittance and who shall set the
broth before him?” The maiden replied, “O my mother, at the
Gate of Allah Almighty!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6853" id="noteref-6853" epub:type="noteref">6853</a> and the dame rejoined, “Do thou
whatso thou willest.” So the damsel arose and cooked a tasse of
broth and mingled with it sundry hot spices such as pimento<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6854" id="noteref-6854" epub:type="noteref">6854</a>
and she had certain leaflets taken from the so-called Wind-tree,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6855" id="noteref-6855" epub:type="noteref">6855</a>
whereof she inserted a small portion deftly mingling the
ingredients. Then the old woman took it and set forth and
walked till she reached the Basha’s mansion where the servants
and eunuchs met her and asked her of what was with her. She
answered, “This is a tasse of broth which I have brought for the
Basha that he drink of it as much as he may fancy: haply
Almighty Allah shall vouchsafe healing to him.” They went in
and reported that to the Basha who exclaimed, “Bring her to me
hither.” Accordingly, they led her within and she offered to him
the tasse of broth, whereupon he rose and sat upright and removed
the cover from the cup which sent forth a pleasant savour: so he
took it and sipped of it a spoonful and a second and a third when
his heart opened to her and he drank of it till he could no more.
Now this was in the forenoon and after finishing the soup he gave
the old woman a somewhat of dinars which she took and returned
therewith to the damsel rejoicing, and handed to her the gold pieces.
But the Basha immediately after drinking the broth felt drowsy
and he slept a restful sleep till mid-afternoon and when he awoke
health had returned to his frame beginning from the time he drank.
So he asked after the ancient dame and sent her word to prepare
for him another tasse of broth like the first; but they told him
that none knew her dwelling-place. Now when the old woman
returned home the maiden asked her whether the broth had
pleased the Basha or not; and she said that it was very much to
his liking; so the girl got ready a second portion but without all
the stronger ingredients<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6856" id="noteref-6856" epub:type="noteref">6856</a> of the first. Then she gave it to the
dame who took it and went forth with it and whilst the Basha was
asking for her behold, up she came and the servants took her and
led her in to the Governor. On seeing her he rose and sat upright
and called for other food and when it was brought he ate his
sufficiency, albeit for a length of time he could neither rise nor
walk. But from the hour he drank all the broth he sniffed the
scent of health and he could move about as he moved when hale
and hearty. So he asked the old dame saying, “Didst thou cook
this broth?” and she answered, “O my lord, my daughter made it
and sent me with it to thee.” He exclaimed, “By Allah this
maiden cannot be thy daughter, O old woman; and she can be
naught save the daughter of Kings. But bid her every day at
morning-tide cook me a tasse of the same broth.” The other
replied, “To hear is to obey,” and returned home with this
message to the damsel who did as the Basha bade the first day
and the second to the seventh day. And the Basha waxed
stronger every day and when the week was ended he took horse
and rode to his pleasure-garden. He increased continually in
force and vigour till, one day of the days, he sent for the dame
and questioned her concerning the damsel who lived with her; so
she acquainted him with her case and what there was in her of
beauty and loveliness and perfect grace. Thereupon the Basha fell
in love with the girl by hearsay and without eye-seeing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6857" id="noteref-6857" epub:type="noteref">6857</a>:——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Basha fell in love
with the girl by hearsay and without eye-seeing: so he changed
his habit and donning a dress of Darwaysh-cut left his mansion
and threaded the streets passing from house to house until he
reached that of the old woman. He then knocked at the entrance
and she came behind it and asked “Who’s at the door?” “A
Darwaysh and a stranger,” answered he, “who knoweth no man in
this town and who is sore anhungered.” Now the ancient dame
was by nature niggardly and she had lief put him off, but the
damsel said to her, “Turn him not away,” and quoting ‘Honour
to the foreigner is a duty,’ said, “So do thou let him in.” She
admitted him and seated him when the maiden brought him a
somewhat of food and stood before him in his service. He ate
one time and ten times he gazed at the girl until he had eaten his
sufficiency when he washed his hands and rising left the house and
went his ways. But his heart flamed with love of the Princess
and he was deeply enamoured of her and he ceased not walking
until he reached his mansion whence he sent for the old woman.
And when they brought her, he produced a mint of money and a
sumptuous dress in which he requested and prayed her to attire
the damsel: then the old woman took it and returned to her
protegée, saying to herself, “By Allah, if the girl accept the Basha
and marry him she will prove sensible as fortunate; but an she
be not content so to do I will turn her out of my door.” When
she went in she gave her the dress and bade her don it, but the
damsel refused till the old woman coaxed her and persuaded her
to try it on. Now when the dame left the Basha, he privily
assumed a woman’s habit and followed in her footsteps; and at
last he entered the house close behind her and beheld the Princess
in the sumptuous dress. Then the fire of his desire flamed higher
in his heart and he lacked patience to part from her, so he returned
to his mansion with mind preoccupied and vitals yearning.
Thither he summoned the old woman and asked her to demand
the girl in marriage and was instant with her and cried, “No help
but this must be.” Accordingly she returned home and acquainted
the girl with what had taken place adding, “O my daughter, verily
the Basha loveth thee and his wish is to wed thee: he hath been a
benefactor to us, and thou wilt never meet his like; for that he is
deeply enamoured of thee and the byword saith, ‘Reward of
lover is return of love.’” And the ancient dame ceased not
gentling her and plying her with friendly words till she was soothed
and gave consent. Then she returned to the Basha and informed
him of her success, so he joyed with exceeding joy, and without
stay or delay bade slaughter beeves and prepare bridal feasts and
spread banquets whereto he invited the notables of his government:
after which he summoned the Kazi who tied the knot and he
went in to her that night. And of the abundance of his love he
fared not forth from her till seven days had sped; and he ceased
not to cohabit with her for a span of five years during which Allah
vouchsafed to him a man-child by her and two daughters. Such
was the case with the cadette Princess; but as regards the eldest
sister, when she entered the city in youth’s attire she was accosted
by the Kunáfah-baker and was hired for a daily wage of a Mídí
of silver besides her meat and drink in his house. Now ’twas the
practice of that man every day to buy half a quartern of flour
and thereof make his vermicelli; but when the so-seeming youth
came to him he would buy and work up three quarterns; and all
the folk who bought Kunafah of him would flock to his shop
with the view of gazing upon the beauty and loveliness of the
Youth and said, “Exalted be He who created and perfected what
He wrought in the creation of this young man!” Now by the
decree of the Decreer the baker’s shop faced the lattice-windows
of the Sultan’s Palace and one day of the days the King’s
daughter chanced to look out at the window and she saw the
Youth standing with sleeves tucked up from arms which shone like
ingots<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6858" id="noteref-6858" epub:type="noteref">6858</a> of silver. Hereat the Princess fell in love with the Youth,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and fell silent
and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine,
and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love and
good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the director,
the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and of deeds
fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the Sultan’s
daughter looked out at the window she fell in love with the youth,
and she knew not how to act that she might forgather with him:
so desire afflicted her and extreme fondness and presently she took
to her pillow all for her affection to that young man. Thereupon
her nurse went in to her and found her lying upon her carpet-bed
a-moaning and a-groaning “Ah!” So she exclaimed, “Thy safety
from all whereof thou hast to complain!” Then she took her
hand and felt her pulse but could find in it no symptoms of sickness
bodily, whereupon she said, “O my lady, thou hast no unease
save what eyesight hath brought thee.” She replied, “O my
mother, do thou keep sacred my secret, and if thy hand can reach
so far as to bring me my desire, prithee do so;” and the nurse
rejoined, “O my lady, like me who can keep a secret? therefore
confide to me thy longing and Allah vouchsafe thee thy dearest
hope.” Said the Princess, “O my mother, my heart is lost to the
young man who worketh in the vermicelli-baker’s shop and if I
fail to be united with him I shall die of grief.” The nurse replied,
“By Allah, O my lady, he is the fairest of his age and indeed I
lately passed by him as his sleeves were tucked up above his forearms
and he ravished my wits: I longed to accost him but shame
overcame me in presence of those who were round him, some
buying Kunafah and others gazing on his beauty and loveliness,
his symmetric stature and his perfect grace. But I, O my lady,
will do thee a service and cause thee forgather with him ere long.”
Herewith the heart of the Princess was solaced and she promised
the nurse all good. Then the old woman left her and fell to
devising how she should act in order to bring about a meeting
between her and the youth or carry him into the Palace. So she
went to the baker’s shop and bringing out an Ashrafi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6859" id="noteref-6859" epub:type="noteref">6859</a> said to him,
“Take, O Master, this gold piece and make me a platter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6860" id="noteref-6860" epub:type="noteref">6860</a> of
vermicelli meet for the best and send it for me by this Youth who
shall bring it to my home that be near hand: I cannot carry it
myself.” Quoth the baker in his mind, “By Allah, good pay is
this gold piece and a Kunafah is worth ten silverlings; so all the
rest is pure profit.” And he replied, “On my head and eyes be it,
O my lady;” and taking the Ashrafi made her a plate of vermicelli
and bade his servant bear it to her house. So he took it up
and accompanied the nurse till she reached the Princess’s palace
when she went in and seated the Youth in an out-of-the-way closet.
Then she repaired to her nursling and said, “Rise up, O my
lady, for I have brought thee thy desire.” The Princess sprang
to her feet in hurry and flurry and fared till she came to the closet;
then, going in she found the Youth who had set down the Kunafah
and who was standing in expectation of the nurse’s return that he
and she might wend homewards. And suddenly the Sultan’s
daughter came in and bade the Youth be seated beside her, and
when he took seat she clasped him to her bosom of her longing for
him and fell to kissing him on the cheeks and mouth ever
believing him to be a male masculant, till her hot desire for him
was quenched.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6861" id="noteref-6861" epub:type="noteref">6861</a> Then she gave to him two golden dinars and said
to him, “O my lord and coolth of my eyes, do thou come hither
every day that we may take our pleasure, I and thou.” He said,
“To hear is to obey,” and went forth from her hardly believing in
his safety, for he had learnt that she was the Sultan’s daughter,
and he walked till he reached the shop of his employer to whom
he gave the twenty dinars. Now when the baker saw the gold,
affright and terror entered his heart and he asked his servant
whence the money came; and, when told of the adventure, his
horror and dismay increased and he said to himself, “An this
case of ours continue, either the Sultan will hear that this youth
practiseth upon his daughter, or she will prove in the family way
and ’twill end in our deaths and the ruin of our country. The
lad must quit this evil path.” Thereupon quoth he to the Youth,
“From this time forwards do thou cease faring forth thereto,”
whereat quoth the other, “I may not prevent myself from going
and I dread death an I go not.” So the man cried, “Do whatso
may seem good to thee.” Accordingly, the Princess in male attire
fell to going every morning and meeting the Sultan’s daughter,
till one day of the days she went in and the twain sat down and
laughed and enjoyed themselves, when lo and behold! the King
entered. And as soon as he espied the youth and saw him seated
beside his daughter, he commanded him be arrested and they
arrested him;——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Sultan entered and saw the youth sitting beside his daughter he
commanded him to be arrested and they arrested him; they also
seized the Princess and bound her forearms to her sides with
straitest bonds. Then the King summoned the Linkman and
bade him smite off both their heads: so he took them and went
down with them to the place of execution. But when the tidings
reached the Kunáfáni he shut up shop without stay and delay and
fled. Presently the Sultan said in his mind, “Fain would I
question the Youth touching his object in entering hither, and ask
him who conducted him to my daughter and how he won access
to her.” Accordingly he sent to bring back the twain and
imprisoned them till nightfall: then he went in to his Harem
and caused his daughter’s person to be examined, and when they
inspected her she proved to be a pure maid. This made the King
marvel, for he supposed that the Youth must have undone her
maidenhead;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6862" id="noteref-6862" epub:type="noteref">6862</a> so he sent for him to the presence, and when he came
he considered him and found him fairer even than his daughter;
nay, far exceeding her in beauty and loveliness. So he cried, “By
Allah this be a wondrous business! Verily my daughter hath
excuse for loving this Youth nor to my judgment doth she even
him in charms: not the less this affair is a shame to us, and the
foulest of stains and needs must the twain be done to death
to-morrow morning!” Herewith he commanded the jailer to take
the Youth and to keep him beside him and he shut up the girl
with her nurse. The jailer forthwith led his charge to the jail;
but it so happened that its portal was low; and, when the Youth
was ordered to pass through it, he bent his brow downwards for
easier entrance, when his turband struck against the lintel and fell
from his head. The jailer turned to look at him, and behold, his
hair was braided and the plaits being loosed gleamed like an ingot
of gold. He felt assured that the youth was a maiden so he
returned to the King in all haste and hurry and cried, “Pardon,
O our lord the Sultan!” “Allah pardon us and thee;” replied
the King, and the man rejoined, “O King of the Age, yonder
Youth is no boy; nay, he be a virgin girl.” Quoth the Sultan,
“What sayest thou?” and quoth the other, “By the truth of Him
who made thee ruler of the necks of His worshippers, O King of
the Age, verily this is a maiden.” So he bade the prison-keeper
bring her and set her in his presence and he returned with her
right soon, but now she paced daintily as the gazelle and veiled her
face, because she saw that the jailer had discovered her sex. The
King then commanded them carry her to the Harem whither he
followed her and presently, having summoned his daughter, he
questioned her concerning the cause of her union with the so-seeming
Youth. Herewith she related all that had happened with
perfect truth: he also put questions to the Princess in man’s habit,
but she stood abashed before him and was dumb, unable to utter a
single word. As soon as it was morning, the Sultan asked of the
place where the Youth had dwelt and they told him that he lodged
with a Kunáfah-baker, and the King bade fetch the man, when they
reported that he had fled. However, the Sultan was instant in
finding him, so they went forth and sought him for two days when
they secured him and set him between the royal hands. He enquired
into the Youth’s case and the other replied, “By Allah, O King
of the Age, between me and him were no questionings and I
wot not whence may be his origin.” The Monarch rejoined, “O
man, thou hast my plighted word for safety, so continue thy
business as before and now gang thy gait.” Then he turned to
the maiden and repeated his enquiries, when she made answer
saying, “O my lord, my tale is wondrous and my adventures
marvellous.” “And what may they be?” he asked her.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Princess
said to the Sultan, “In very sooth my tale is passing strange,” and
he besought her to recount it. So she began to disclose the whole
of her history and the adventures which had befallen her and her
sisters and their mother; especially of the shipwreck in middlemost
ocean and of her coming to land; after which she told the
affair of the Wazir burnt by her sire, that traitor who had separated
children from father and, brief, all that had betided them from first
to last. Hearing her soft speech and her strange story the Sultan
marvelled and his heart inclined herwards; then he gave her in
charge to the Palace women and conferred upon her favours and
benefits. But when he looked upon her beauty and loveliness, her
brilliancy and perfect grace he fell deeply in love with her, and his
daughter hearing the accidents which had happened to the Princess’s
father cried, “By Allah, the story of this damsel should be chronicled
in a book, that it become the talk of posterity and be quoted as
an instance of the omnipotence of Allah Almighty; for He it is
who parteth and scattereth and re-uniteth.” So saying she took
her and carried her to her own apartment where she entreated her
honourably; and the maiden, after she had spent a month in the
Palace, showed charms grown two-fold and even more. At last
one day of the days, as she sat beside the King’s daughter in her
chamber about eventide, when the sun was hot after a sultry summer
day and her cheeks had flushed rosy red, behold, the Sultan
entered passing through the room on his way to the Harem and
his glance undesignedly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6863" id="noteref-6863" epub:type="noteref">6863</a> fell upon the Princess who was in home
gear, and he looked a look of eyes that cost him a thousand sighs.
So he was astounded and stood motionless knowing not whether to
go or to come; and when his daughter sighted him in such plight
she went up to him and said, “What hath betided thee and brought
thee to this condition?” Quoth he, “By Allah, this girl hath stolen
my senses from my soul: I am fondly enamoured of her and if
thou aid me not by asking her in marriage and I fail to wed her
’twill make my wits go clean bewildered.” Thereupon the King’s
daughter returned to the damsel and drawing near her said, “O
my lady and light of my eyes, indeed my father hath seen thee in
thy deshabille and he hath hung<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6864" id="noteref-6864" epub:type="noteref">6864</a> all his hopes upon thee, so do not
thou contrary my words nor the counsel I am about to offer thee.”
“And what may that be, O my lady?” asked she, and the other
answered, “My wish is to marry thee to my sire and thou be to
him wife and he be to thee man.” But when the maiden heard
these words she wept with bitter weeping till she sobbed aloud and
cried, “Time hath mastered us and decreed separation: I know
nothing of my mother and sisters and father, an they be dead or on
life, and whether they were drowned or came to ground; then how
should I enjoy a bridal fête when they may be in mortal sadness
and sorrow?” But the other ceased not to soothe her and array
fair words against her and show her fondly friendship till her soul
consented to wedlock. Presently the other brought out to her what
habit befitted the occasion still comforting her heart with pleasant
converse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6865" id="noteref-6865" epub:type="noteref">6865</a> after which she carried the tidings to her sire. So he
sent forthright to summon his Lords of the reign and Grandees of
the realm and the knot was tied between them twain; and, going
in unto her that night, he found her a hoard wherefrom the spell
had freshly been dispelled; and of his longing for her and his
desire to her he abode with her two se’nnights never going forth
from her or by night or by day. Hereat the dignitaries of his
empire were sore vexed for that their Sultan ceased to appear
at the Divan and deal commandment between man and man, and
his daughter went in and acquainted him therewith. He asked
her how long he had absented himself and she answered saying,
“Knowest thou how long thou hast tarried in the Palace?” whereto
he replied “Nay.” “Fourteen whole days,” cried she, whereupon
he exclaimed, “By Allah, O my daughter, I thought to myself that
I had spent with her two days and no more.” And his daughter
wondered to hear his words. Such was the case of the cadette
Princess; but as regards the King, the father of the damsel, when
he forgathered with the mother of his three daughters and she
told him of the shipwreck and the loss of her children he determined
to travel in search of the three damsels, he and the Wazir habited
as Darwayshes——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of
day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine,

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
resolved to travel in search of his children (the three damsels)
he and his Wazir habited as Darwayshes. So leaving the government
in charge of his wife he went forth and the twain in their
search first visited the cities on the seaboard beginning with the
nearest; but they knew not what was concealed from them in the
world of the future. They stinted not travelling for the space of
a month till they came to a city whose Sultan had a place hight
Al-Dijlah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6866" id="noteref-6866" epub:type="noteref">6866</a> whereupon he had built a Palace. The Darwayshes
made for it and found the King sitting in his Kiosque<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6867" id="noteref-6867" epub:type="noteref">6867</a> accompanied
by two little lads, the elder eight years old and the second
six. They drew near to him and saluting him offered their
services and blessed him, wishing him length of life as is the
fashion when addressing royalties; and he returned their greetings
and made them draw near and showed them kindness; also, when
it was eventide he bade his men serve them with somewhat of
food. On the next day the King fared forth to Tigris-bank and
sat in his Kiosque together with the two boys. Now the Darwayshes
had hired them a cell in the Khan whence it was their
daily wont to issue forth and wander about the city asking for
what they sought; and this day they again came to the place
wherein sat the Sultan and they marvelled at the fair ordinance of
the Palace. They continued to visit it every day till one day
of the days the two went out, according to their custom, and
when entering the Palace one of the King’s children, which was
the younger, came up to them and fell to considering them as
if he had forgotten his own existence. This continued till the
Darwayshes retired to their cell in the caravanserai whither the
boy followed them to carry out the Secret Purpose existing in the
All-knowledge of Allah. And when the two sat down the
Sultan’s son went in to them and fell to gazing upon them and
solacing himself with the sight, when the elder Darwaysh clasped
him to his bosom and fell to kissing his cheeks, marvelling at his
semblance and at his beauty; and the boy in his turn forgot his
father and his mother and took to the old man. Now whenas
night fell the Sultan retired homewards fancying that his boy
had foregone him to his mother while the Sultánah fancied that
her child was with his father, and this endured till such time as
the King had entered the Harem. But only the elder child was
found there so the Sultan asked, “Where is the second boy?”
and the Queen answered, “Day by day thou takest them with
thee to Tigris-bank and thou bringest them back; but to-day
only the elder hath returned.” Thereupon they sought him but
found him not and the mother buffeted her face in grief for her
child and the father lost his right senses. Then the high Officials
fared forth to search for their King’s son and sought him from
early night to the dawn of day, but not finding him they deemed
that he had been drowned in Tigris-water. So they summoned
all the fishermen and divers and caused them to drag the river
for a space of four days. All this time and the boy abode with
the Darwayshes, who kept saying to him, “Go to thy father and
thy mother;” but he would not obey them and he would sit
with the Fakirs upon whom all his thoughts were fixed while
theirs were fixed upon him. This lasted till the fifth day when
the door-keeper unsummoned entered the cell and found the
Sultan’s son sitting with the old men; so he went out hurriedly
and repairing to the King cried, “O my Sovran, thy boy is with
those Darwayshes who were wont daily to visit thee.” Now when
the Sultan heard the porter’s words, he called aloud to his
Eunuchs and Chamberlains and gave them his orders; when they
ran a race, as it were, till they entered upon the holy men and
carried them from their cell together with the boy and set all
four<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6868" id="noteref-6868" epub:type="noteref">6868</a> before the Sultan. The King exclaimed, “Verily these
Darwayshes must be spies and their object was to carry off my
boy;” so he took up his child and clasped him to his bosom
and kissed him again and again of his yearning fondness to him,
and presently he sent him to his mother who was well-nigh frantic.
Then he committed the two Fakirs (with commands to decapitate
them) to the Linkman who took them and bound their hands and
bared their heads and fell to crying, “This be his reward and the
least of awards who turneth traitor and kidnappeth the sons of
the Kings;” and as he cried all the citizens great and small flocked
to the spectacle. But when the boy heard the proclamation, he
went forth in haste till he stood before the elder Darwaysh who
was still kneeling upon the rug of blood and threw himself upon
him at full length till the Grandees of his father forcibly removed
him. Then the executioner stepped forward purposing to strike
the necks of the two old men and he raised his sword hand till
the dark hue of his armpit showed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6869" id="noteref-6869" epub:type="noteref">6869</a> and he would have dealt
the blow when the boy again made for the elder Fakir and
threw himself upon him not only once but twice and thrice, preventing
the Sworder’s stroke and abode clinging to the old man.
The Sultan cried, “This Darwaysh is a Sorcerer:” but when the
tidings reached the Sultanah, the boy’s mother, she exclaimed,
“O King, needs must this Darwaysh have a strange tale to tell,
for the boy is wholly absorbed in him. So it is not possible to
slay him on this wise till thou summon him to the presence and
question him: I also will listen to him behind the curtain and
thus none shall hear him save our two selves.” The King did
her bidding and commanded the old man to be brought: so they
took him from under the sword and set him before the King——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her
sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where
is this compared with that I would relate to you on the coming
night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was
the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Three Hundred and Eighty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that at the King’s
bidding they took up the Fakir who was still kneeling under the
glaive and set him before the King who bade him be seated.
And when he sat him down the Sultan commanded all who were
in the presence of Eunuchs and Chamberlains to withdraw, and
they withdrew leaving the Sovran with the old religious. But the
second Darwaysh still knelt in his bonds under the sword of the
Sworder who, standing over against his head, kept looking for the
royal signal to strike. Then cried the King, “O Mendicant, what
drove thee to take my son, the core of my heart?” He replied,
“By Allah, O King, I took him not for mine own pleasure;
but he would not go from me and I threatened him, withal he
showed no fear till this destiny descended upon us.” Now when
the Sultan heard these words his heart softened to the old man
and he pitied him while the Sultanah who sat behind the curtain
fell to weeping aloud. Presently the King said, “O Darwaysh,
relate to us thy history, for needs must it be a singular;” but the
old man began to shed tears and said, “O King of the Age, I
have a marvellous adventure which were it graven with needle-gravers
upon the eye corners were a warning to whoso would be
warned.” The Sultan was surprised and replied, “What then
may be thy history, O Mendicant?” and the other rejoined, “O
King of the Age, I will recount it to thee.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6870" id="noteref-6870" epub:type="noteref">6870</a> Accordingly he told
him of his kingship and the Wazir tempting his wife and of her
slaying the nurse, the slave-girls, and the Eunuch; but when he
came to this point the Sultanah ran out in haste and hurry from
behind the curtain and rushing up to the Darwaysh threw herself
upon his bosom. The King seeing this marvelled and in a fury of
jealousy clapped hand to hilt crying to the Fakir, “This be most
unseemly behaviour!” But the Queen replied, “Hold thy hand,
by Allah, he is my father and I am his loving daughter;” and
she wept and laughed alternately<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6871" id="noteref-6871" epub:type="noteref">6871</a> all of the excess of her joy.
Hereat the King wondered and bade release the second religious
and exclaimed, “Sooth he spake who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Allah joineth the parted when think the twain ✿ With firmest thought ne’er to   meet again.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then the Sultanah began recounting to him the history of her
sire and specially what befel him from his Wazir; and he, when he
heard her words, felt assured of their truth. Presently he bade them
change the habits of her father and of his Wazir and dress them
with the dress of Kings; and he set apart for them an apartment
and allotted to them rations of meat and drink; so extolled be
He who disuniteth and re-uniteth! Now the Sultanah in question
was the youngest daughter of the old King who had been met by
the Knight when out hunting, the same that owed all his fair
fortunes to her auspicious coming. Accordingly the father was
assured of having found the lost one and was delighted to note her
high degree; but after tarrying with her for a time he asked permission
of his son-in-law to set out in quest of her two sisters and he
supplicated Almighty Allah to reunite him with the other twain as
with this first one. Thereupon quoth the Sultan, “It may not be
save that I accompany thee, for otherwise haply some mishap of
the world may happen to thee.” Then the three sat down in
council debating what they should do and in fine they agreed to
travel, taking with them some of the Lords of the land and
Chamberlains and Nabobs. They made ready and after three
days they marched out of the city——And Shahrazad was surprised
by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate

the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the old King
marched forth the city accompanied by his son-in-law and his
Wazir after the Sultan had supplied his own place by a Viceregent
who would carry out his commandments. Then they
turned to travelling in quest of the two lost daughters and stinted
not their wayfare for a space of twenty days, when they drew near
a city lofty of base, and, finding a spacious camping-plain, thereon
pitched their tents. The time was set of sun, so the cooks
applied themselves to getting ready the evening meal and when
supper was served up all ate what sufficed them, and it was but
little because of the travails of travel, and they nighted in that site
until morn was high. Now the ruler of that city was a Sultan
mighty of might, potent of power and exceeding in energy; and
he was surprised to hear a Chamberlain report to him saying, “O
King of the Age, after an eventless night early this morning we
found outside thy capital tents and pavilions with standards and
banners planted overagainst them and all this after the fashion of
the Kings.” The Sovran replied, “There is no help but that to
these creations of Allah some requirement is here: however, we
will learn their tidings.” So he took horse with his Grandees and
made for the ensigns and colours, and drawing near he noted
gravity and majesty in the array and eunuchs and followers and
serving-men standing ready to do duty. Then he dismounted and
walked till he approached the bystanders whom he greeted with
the salam. They salam’d in return and received him with most
honourable reception and highmost respect till they had introduced
him into the royal Shahmiyánah; when the two Kings rose to
him and welcomed him and he wished them long life in such
language as is spoken by Royalties; and all sat down to converse
one with other. Now the Lord of the city had warned his people
before he fared forth that dinner must be prepared; so when it
was mid-forenoon the Farrásh-folk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6872" id="noteref-6872" epub:type="noteref">6872</a> spread the tables with trays of
food and the guests came forward, one and all, and enjoyed their
meal and were gladdened. Then the dishes were carried away
for the servants and talk went round till sunset, at which time the
King again ordered food to be brought and all supped till they
had their sufficiency. But the Sultan kept wondering in his mind
and saying, “Would Heaven I wot the cause of these two Kings
coming to us!” and when night fell the strangers prayed him to
return home and to revisit them next morning. So he farewelled
them and fared forth. This lasted three days, during which time
he honoured them with all honour, and on the fourth he got ready
for them a banquet and invited them to his Palace. They mounted
and repaired thither when he set before them food; and as soon
as they had fed, the trays were removed and coffee and confections
and sherbets were served up and they sat talking and enjoying
themselves till supper-tide when they sought permission to hie
campwards. But the Sultan of the city sware them to pass the
night with him; so they returned to their session till the father of
the damsels said, “Let each of us tell a tale that our waking hours
may be the more pleasant.” “Yes,” they replied and all agreed
in wishing that the Sultan of the city would begin. Now by the
decree of the Decreer the lattice-window of the Queen opened upon
the place of session and she could see them and hear every word
they said. He began, “By Allah I have to relate an adventure
which befel me and ’tis one of the wonders of our time.” Quoth
they, “And what may it be?”——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted
say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful
is thy tale, O sister mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Sultan
of the city said, “In such a year I had a malady which none
availed to medicine until at last an old woman came to me bearing
a tasse of broth which when I drank caused health return to me.
So I bade her bring me a cupful every day and I drank it till,
after a time, I chanced to ask her who made that broth and she
answered that it was her daughter. And one day I assumed a
disguise and went to the ancient dame’s house and there saw the
girl who was a model of beauty and loveliness, brilliancy, symmetric
stature and perfect grace, and seeing her I lost my heart to
her, and asked her to wife.” She answered, “How can I wed; I
separated from my sisters and parents and all unknowing what
hath become of them?” Now when the father of the damsels
heard these words, tears rolled down his cheeks in rills and he
remembered his two lost girls and wept and moaned and complained,
the Sultan looking on in astonishment the while; and
when he went to his Queen he found her lying in a fainting fit.
Hereupon he cried out her name and seated her and she on coming
to exclaimed, “By Allah, he who wept before you is my very
father: by Him who created me I have no doubt thereof!” So
the Sultan went down to his father-in-law and led him up to the
Harem, and the daughter rose and met him and they threw their
arms round each other’s necks, and fondly greeted each other.
After this the old King passed the night relating to her what had
befallen him while she recounted to him whatso hath betided her,
from first to last, whereupon their rejoicings increased and the
father thanked Almighty Allah for having found two of his three
children. The old King and his sons-in-law and his Wazir ceased
not to enjoy themselves in the city, eating and drinking<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6873" id="noteref-6873" epub:type="noteref">6873</a> and
making merry for a space of two days when the father asked
aidance of his daughters’ husbands to seek his third child that the
general joy might be perfected. This request they granted and
resolved to journey with him; so they made their preparations for
travel and issued forth the city together with sundry Lords of the
land and high Dignitaries, all taking with them what was required of
rations. Then travelling together in a body they faced the march.
This was their case; but as regards the third daughter (she who
in man’s attire had served the Kunáfah-baker), after being married
to the Sultan his love for her and desire to her only increased
and she cohabited with him for a length of time. But one day of the
days she called to mind her parents and her kith and kin and her
native country, so she wept with sorest weeping till she swooned
away and when she recovered she rose without stay or delay and
taking two suits of Mameluke’s habits patiently awaited the fall of
night. Presently she donned one of the dresses and went down to
the stables where, finding all the grooms asleep, she saddled her
a stallion of the noblest strain and clinging to the near side
mounted him. Then, having supplicated the veiling of the Veiler,
she fared undercover of the glooms for her own land, all unweeting
the way, and when night gave place to day she saw herself amidst
mountains and sands; nor did she know what she should do.
However she found on a hill-flank some remnants of the late rain
which she drank; then, loosing the girths of her horse she gave
him also to drink and she was about to take her rest in that place
when, lo and behold! a lion big of bulk and mighty of might drew
near her and he was lashing his tail<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6874" id="noteref-6874" epub:type="noteref">6874</a> and roaring thunderously.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable
and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the lion
advanced to spring upon the Princess who was habited as a Mameluke,
and rushed to rend her in pieces, she, seeing her imminent
peril, sprang up in haste and bared her blade and met him brand
in hand saying, “Or he will slay me or I slay him.” But as she
was hearty of heart she advanced till the two met and fell to fight
and struck each at other, but the lion waxed furious and gnashed
his tusks, now retreating and now circuiting around her and then
returning to front his foe purposing to claw her, when she
heartened her heart and without giving ground she swayed her
sabre with all the force of her forearm and struck the beast between
the eyes and the blade came out gleaming between his thighs and
he sank on earth life-forlore and weltering in his gore. Presently
she wiped her scymitar and returned it to its sheath; then, drawing
a whittle she came up to the carcass intending to skin it for her
own use, when behold, there towered from afar two dust-clouds,
one from the right and the other from the left, whereat she withdrew
from flaying the lion’s fell and applied herself to looking out.
Now by the decree of the Decreer the first dust-cloud approaching
her was that raised by the host of her father and his sons-in-law who,
when they drew near all stood to gaze upon her and consider her,
saying in wonderment one to other, “How can this white slave (and
he a mere lad) have slain this lion single-handed? Walláhi, had
that beast charged down upon us he had scattered us far and
wide, and haply he had torn one of us to pieces. By Allah, this
matter is marvellous!” But the Mameluke looked mainly at the
old King whom he knew to be his sire for his heart went forth to
him. Meanwhile the second dust-cloud approached until those
beneath it met the others who had foregone them, and behold, under
it was the husband of the disguised Princess and his many. Now
the cause of this King marching forth and coming thither was this.
When he entered the Palace intending for the Harem, he found not
his Queen, and he fared forth to seek her and presently by the
decree of the Decreer the two hosts met at the place where the lion
had been killed. The Sultan gazed upon the Mameluke and marvelled
at his slaying the monster and said to himself, “Now were
this white slave mine I would share with him my good and stablish
him in my kingdom.” Herewith the Mameluke came forward and
flayed the lion of his fell and gutted him; then, lighting a fire he
roasted somewhat of his flesh until it was sufficiently cooked all
gazing upon him the while and marvelling at the heartiness of his
heart. And when the meat was ready, he carved it and setting it
upon a Sufrah<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6875" id="noteref-6875" epub:type="noteref">6875</a> of leather said to all present, “Bismillah, eat, in the
name of Allah, what Fate hath given to you!” Thereupon all
came forward and fell to eating of the lion’s flesh except the
Princess’s husband who was not pleased to join them and said,
“By Allah, I will not eat of this food until I learn the case of this
youth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6876" id="noteref-6876" epub:type="noteref">6876</a> Now the Princess had recognised her spouse from the
moment of his coming, but she was concealed from him by her
Mameluke’s clothing; and he disappeared time after time then
returned to gaze upon the white slave, eyeing now his eyes now his
sides and now the turn of his neck and saying privily in his
mind, “Laud to the Lord who created and fashioned him! By
Allah this Mameluke is the counterpart of my wife in eyes and
nose, and all his form and features are made likest-like unto hers.
So extolled be He who hath none similar and no equal!” He was
drowned in this thought but all the rest ate till they had eaten
enough; then they sat down to pass the rest of their day and their
night in that stead. When it was dawn each and every craved
leave to depart upon his own business; but the Princess’s husband
asked permission to wander in quest of her while the old King, the
father of the damsels, determined to go forth with his two sons-in-law
and find the third and last of his lost daughters. Then the
Mameluke said to them, “O my lords, sit we down, I and you, for
the rest of the day in this place and to-morrow I will travel with
you.” Now the Princess for the length of her wanderings (which
began too when she was a little one) had forgotten the semblance
of her sire; but when she looked upon the old King her heart
yearned unto him and she fell to talking with him, while he on
his part whenever he gazed at her felt a like longing and sought
speech of her. So the first who consented to the Mameluke’s
proposal was the sire whose desire was naught save to sit beside
her; then the rest also agreed to pass the day reposing in that
place, for that it was a pleasant mead and a spacious, garnished
with green grass and bright with bourgeon and blossom. So they
took seat there till sundown when each brought out what victual
he had and all ate their full and then fell to conversing; and
presently said the Princess, “O my lords, let each of you tell us a
tale which he deemeth strange.” Her father broke in saying,
“Verily this rede be right and the first to recount will be I, for
indeed mine is a rare adventure.” Then he began his history
telling them that he was born a King and that such-and-such
things had befallen him and so forth until the end of his tale;
and the Princess hearing his words was certified that he was
her sire. So presently she said, “And I too have a strange
history.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day
and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth
her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister
mine, and enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where

director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Princess
in Mameluke’s habit said, “And I too have a strange history.”
Then she fell to relating all that had betided her from the very
beginning to that which hath before been described; and when
her father heard it he felt assured that she was his daughter. So
he arose and threw himself upon her and embraced her and after
he veiled her face with a kerchief  was with him, and her husband
exclaimed, “Would to Heaven that I also could forgather with my
wife.” Quoth she, “Inshallah, and that soon,” and she inclined
to him after kindly fashion and said to herself, “Indeed this be
my true husband.” Herewith all resolved to march from that
stead and they departed, the Princess’s spouse still unknowing
that she was his wife; and they stinted not faring till they entered
the Sultan’s city and all made for the Palace. Then the Princess
slipped privily into the Harem without the knowledge of her mate
and changed her semblance, when her father said to her husband,
“Hie thee to the women’s apartment: haply Allah may show to
thee thy wife.” So he went in and found her sitting in her own
apartment and he marvelled as he espied her and drew near her
and threw his arms round her neck of his fond love to her and
asked her concerning her absence. Thereupon she told him the
truth saying, “I went forth seeking my sire and habited in a
Mameluke’s habit and ’twas I slew the lion and roasted his flesh
over the fire, but thou wouldest not eat thereof.” At these words
the Sultan rejoiced and his rejoicings increased and all were in
the highmost of joy and jolliment; he and her father with the two
other sons-in-law, and this endured for a long while. But at last
all deemed it suitable to revisit their countries and capitals and
each farewelled his friends and the whole party returned safe and
sound to their own homes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6877" id="noteref-6877" epub:type="noteref">6877</a></p>
