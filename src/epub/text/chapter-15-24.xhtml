			<h2 epub:type="title">Tale of Himself Told by the King<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7707" id="noteref-7707" epub:type="noteref">7707</a></h2>

<p>I have a tale, O my lord the Kazi, which bewildereth the wits
and it is on this wise. By birth and origin I was the son of a
Khwájah, but my father owned much worldly wealth in money and
effects and vaiselle and rarities and so forth, besides of landed
estates and of fiefs and mortmains a store galore. And every
year when the ships of Al-Hind would arrive bringing Indian
goods and coffee from Al-Yaman the folk bought thereof one-fourth
of the whole and he three-fourths paying in ready cash
and hard money.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7708" id="noteref-7708" epub:type="noteref">7708</a> So his word was heard and his works were
preferred amongst the Traders and the Grandees and the Rulers.
Also he had controul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7709" id="noteref-7709" epub:type="noteref">7709</a> in counselling the Kings and he was held
in awe and obeyed by the merchants, one and all, who consulted
him in each and every of their affairs. This endured until one
year of the years when suddenly he fell sick and his sickness
grew upon him and gained mastery over his frame, so he sent for
me, saying, “Bring me my son.” Accordingly I went and entered
to him and found him changed of condition and nearing his last
gasp. But he turned to me and said, “O my son, I charge thee
with a charge which do thou not transgress nor contrary me in
whatso I shall declare to thee.” “What may that be?” asked I,
and he answered, “O my son, do thou never make oath in Allah’s
name, or falsely or truly, even although they fill the world for thee
with wealth; but safeguard thy soul in this matter and gainsay it
not, nor give ear to aught other.” But when it was midnight the
Divine Mystery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7710" id="noteref-7710" epub:type="noteref">7710</a> left him and he died to the mercy of Allah
Almighty; so I buried him, expending much money upon his
funeral and graved him in a handsome tomb. He had left to me
wealth in abundance such as the pens could not compute, but
when a month or so had sped after his decease suddenly came to
me a party of folk, each and every claiming by way of debt from
me and my sire the sum of some five thousand dinars. “Where
be your written bond given by my father?” asked I; but they
answered, “There be no instrument and if thou believe us not make
oath by Allah.” Replied I saying, “Never will I swear at all,”
and paid them whatso they demanded; after which all who feared
not the Lord would come to me and say, “We have such-and-such
owing to us by thy parent;” and I would pay them off until
there remained to me of ready moneys a matter neither great nor
small. Hereupon I fell to selling off my landed estates——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Nine Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the King thus
continued his relation to the Kazi:—I began selling off my landed
estates and fiefs and letting out my settlements of bequeathal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7711" id="noteref-7711" epub:type="noteref">7711</a>
until naught of all that remained by me; so I fell to vending the
house-gear and goods and carpets and pots and pans until I
owned nothing whatever, and my case waxed straitened and the
affair was grievous to me. Then quoth I to myself, “Allah’s
earth for Allah’s folk!” and, albeit I had a wife and two male
children, I left them and went forth under cover of the night a
wanderer about the world and unknowing where I should bring
myself to anchor. But suddenly O my lord the Kazi, I was
confronted by a man whose aspect bred awe, showing signs of
saintliness and garbed wholly in spotless white; so I accosted him
and kissed his hand, and he on seeing me said, “O my son, there
is no harm to thee!” presently adding,</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">“Do thou be heedless of thy cark and care ✿ And unto Fate commit thy whole affair;</div>
      <div class="line">The Lord shall widen what to thee is strait; ✿ The Lord shall all for breadth of space prepare:</div>
      <div class="line">The Lord shall gladly end thy grievous toils; ✿ The Lord shall work His will, so jar forbear.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After these words he took my hand and walked with me athwart
those wilds and wolds till such time as we made a city and entered
its gates. Here, however, we found no signs of creature-kind
nor any mark of Son of Adam, and when I sighted this my condition
changed and fear and affright entered my heart. But
presently the man turned to me and said, “Dread not nor be
startled, for that this city shall (Inshallah!) be thy portion, and
herein thou shalt become Sovran and Sultan.” Quoth I to
myself, “Walláhi, verily this man be Jinn-mad lacking wit and
understanding! How shall I become King and Kaysar in such
place which is all ruins?” Then he turned to me yet another
time, saying, “Trust in Allah and gainsay Him not; for verily
shall come to thee joy out of that wherein thou wast of straitness
and annoy.”——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale,
O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she,
“And where is this compared with that I would relate an

night and that was</p>

    <div>The Nine Hundred and Thirteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that quoth the
man to the youth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7712" id="noteref-7712" epub:type="noteref">7712</a> “Trust in Allah, for verily joy shall assuredly
come to thee from the Almighty.” “What joy?” quoth the
Khwajah’s son, “and indeed this city is a ruinous heap nor is
there indweller or habitant or any to attest God’s Unity.” But
the man ceased not going about the highways of the deserted
town with his companion till such time as he reached the Palace
of the Sultanate, and the twain entering therein found it with its
vases and its tapestry like a bride tricked out.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7713" id="noteref-7713" epub:type="noteref">7713</a> But the Spider
had tented therein, so both the wights fell to shaking and sweeping
for a three days’ space till they had cleaned away all the
webbing and the dust of years; after which the elder man took the
younger and entered a closet. Herein he came upon a trap-door
which the two uplifted, when behold, they found a staircase
leading below; so they descended and walked till they ended at
a place with four open halls, one and all fulfilled with gold, and
amiddlemost thereof rose a jetting fount twenty ells long by fifteen
broad, and the whole basin was heaped up with glittering gems
and precious ores. When the merchant’s son saw this sight, he
was wildered in his wits and perplext in his thoughts, but the man
said to him, “O my son, all this hath become thine own good.”
After this the two replaced the trap-door as it was and quitted
that place; then the man took him and led him to another stead
concealed from the ken of man wherein he found arms and
armour and costly raiment; and the two stinted not wandering
about that palace until they reached the royal Throne-room.
Now when the Khwajah’s son looked upon it he waxed distraught
and fell a-fainting to the floor for awhile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7714" id="noteref-7714" epub:type="noteref">7714</a> and presently when
he revived he asked his companion, “O my lord, what be this?”
Answered he, “This be the throne of the Sultanate wherewith
the Almighty hath gifted thee;” and quoth the other, “By Allah,
O my lord, I believe that there is not in me or strength or long-suffering
to take seat upon yonder throne.” All this the King
(who erst was a merchant’s son) recounted to the Judge and
presently resumed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7715" id="noteref-7715" epub:type="noteref">7715</a>:—Then the man, O my lord, said to me,
“O my son, to all who shall come hither and seek thee be sure
thou distribute gifts and do alms-deeds; so the folk, hearing of
thy largesse, shall flock to thee and gather about thee, and as
often as one shall visit thee, exceed in honour and presents from
the treasure-store thou hast sighted and whose site thou weetest.”
And so speaking, O our lord the Kazi, he vanished from my
view and I wist not an he had upflown to the firmament or had
dived into the depths of the earth, but one thing I knew; to wit,
that I was alone.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn
of day and fell silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then
quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister
mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And
where is this compared with that I would relate to you on the
coming night an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it
was the next night and that was</p>

be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the merchant’s
son resumed to the Kazi:—Then the man vanisht from my view
and I wist no more thereof. So I seated me (and I all alone) in
that city for the first day and the second, but on the third behold,
I saw a crowd making for me from the city-suburbs and they were
seeking a site wherefrom they had somewhat to require. So I met
them and welcomed them and seated them, and soon I arose and
cooking for them food ate in their company and we nighted
together; and when it was morning I presented each and every
of them with an hundred dinars. These they accepted and fared
forth from me and on reaching their homes they recounted the
adventure to other folk who also flocked to me and received
presents like those who preceded them. Anon appeared to me a
multitude with their children and wives who said, “Billáhi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7716" id="noteref-7716" epub:type="noteref">7716</a> O my
lord, accept of us that we may settle beside thee and be under thy
protecting glance;” whereupon I ordered houses be given to
them. Moreover there was amongst them a comely youth who
showed signs of prosperity and him I made my assessor; so we
two, I and he, would converse together. The crowd thickened,
little by little, until the whilome ruined city became fulfilled of
habitants, when I commanded sundry of them that they go forth
and lay out gardens and orchards and plant tree-growths; and a
full-told year had not elapsed ere the city returned to its older estate
and waxed great as erst it was and I became therein Sovran
and Sultan. Such was the case of this King;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7717" id="noteref-7717" epub:type="noteref">7717</a> but as regards
the matter of his wife and his two sons, whenas he fared forth from
them he left them naught to eat and presently their case was
straitened and the twain set out, each in his own direction, and
overwandered the world and endured the buffets of life until their
semblance was changed for stress of toil and travail and transit
from region to region for a while of time. At last, by decree of
the Decreer, the elder was thrown by Eternal Fate into the very
town wherein was his sire and said to himself, “I will fare to the
King of this city and take from him somewhat.”——And Shahrazad
was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased
saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Nine Hundred and Fifteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the young man
went in to the Sultan and kissed ground before him and the King regarding
him felt his heart yearn himwards and said, “What wantest
thou, O youth?” “My design is service with thee,” said the other;
and the King rejoined, “Then welcome to thee!” So he abode in his
employ for a term of four months until he became like unto a
Mameluke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7718" id="noteref-7718" epub:type="noteref">7718</a> and his first case was changed: the Sultan also drew
him near and fell to consulting him in sundry matters the which
proved propitious, so quoth the King, “By Allah, this young man
meriteth naught less than to become my Wazir,” and accordingly
made him his Minister of the Right. In his new degree he became
as another liege lord<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7719" id="noteref-7719" epub:type="noteref">7719</a> and his word was heard, so the land was
opened up by his hand and year by year he derived from it corvées
and taxes, nor did he cease to be Chief Councillor under the right
hand of the King. Meanwhile his brother who was the younger
stinted not faring from land to land until he was met by a party of
wayfarers that said to him, “O youth, verily the Sultan who ruleth
in such a capital is a liberal lord, loving the poor and paupers; so do
thou seek him and haply shall he show himself bounteous to thee.”
Quoth he, “I know not the city,” and quoth they, “We will lead
thee thereto for we purpose to go by his town.” So they took him
and he accompanied them until they reached the city when he
farewelled them and entered the gates. After solacing himself
with the sights he passed that night in the Wakálah and as soon
as it was morning he fared forth to serve for somewhat wherewith
he might nourish himself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7720" id="noteref-7720" epub:type="noteref">7720</a> and it was his lot and the doom of the
Decreer that the Sultan, who had ridden forth to seek his pleasure
in the gardens, met him upon the highway. The King’s glance
fell upon the youth and he was certified of his being a stranger
and a wanderer for that his clothes were old and worn, so he thrust
hand into pouch and passed to him a few gold pieces which the
other accepted right thankfully and blessed the giver and enlarged
his benediction with eloquent tongue and the sweetest speech. The
Sultan hearing this bade them bring to him the stranger, and
whenas they did his bidding he questioned him of his case and was
informed that he was a foreigner who had no friends in that stead;
whereupon the Sovran took him in and clothed him and entreated
him with kindness and liberality.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7721" id="noteref-7721" epub:type="noteref">7721</a> And after a time the Wazir of
the Right became kindly hearted unto him and took him into his
household where he fell to teaching him until the youth waxed
experienced in expression and right ready of reply and acquired
full knowledge of kingcraft. Presently quoth the Minister to the
Sultan, “O King of the Age, indeed this youth befitteth naught
save councillorship, so do thou make him Wazir of the Left.” The
King said, “With love,” and followed his advice; nor was it long
before his heart inclined to the hearts of his two Ministers and the
time waxed clear to him and the coming of these two youths
brought him serenity for a length of days and they also were in the
most joyous of life. But as regards their mother; when her sons
went forth from her, she abode alone——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet is
thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would
relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Nine Hundred and Sixteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the woman
who abode alone having been abandoned by her husband and
her children, cried, “I am here sitting sans my mate and sans
my sons; whatso shall I ever do?” and anon the case became
grievous to her and she set out to bewander the regions saying,
“Haply shall Allah reunite me with my children and my husband!”
And she stinted not passing from place to place and shifting from
site to site until she reached a town upon the margin of the main
and found a vessel in cargo and about to sail.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7722" id="noteref-7722" epub:type="noteref">7722</a> Now by the
decree of the Decreer the ship-captain having heard tell of the
Sultan’s generosity and open handedness had made ready for
him a present and was about to voyage therewith to his capital.
Learning this the woman said to him, “Allah upon thee, O
Captain, take me with thee;” and he did accordingly, setting
sail with a fair wind. He sped over the billows of that sea for a
space of forty days and throughout this time he kept all the
precepts and commandments of religion, as regards the woman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7723" id="noteref-7723" epub:type="noteref">7723</a>
supplying her with meat and drink; nay more, he was wont to
address her, “O my mother.” And no sooner had they made the
city than he landed and disembarked the present and loading it
upon porters’ backs took his way therewith to the Sovran and
continued faring until he entered the presence. The Sultan
accepted the gift and largessed him in return, and at even-tide
the skipper craved leave of return to his ship fearing lest any
harm befal vessel or passengers. So he said, “O King of the
Age, on board with me is a woman, but she is of goodly folk and
godly and I am apprehensive concerning her.” “Do thou night
here with us,” quoth the Sovran, “and I will despatch my two
Wazirs to keep guard over her until dawn shall break.” Quoth
the Captain, “Hearing and obeying,” and he sat with the Sultan,
who at night-fall commissioned his two Ministers and placed the
vessel under their charge and said, “Look ye well to your lives,
for an aught be lost from the ship I will cut off your heads.” So
they went down to her and took their seats the one on poop and
the other on prow until near midnight when both were seized by
drowsiness; and said each to other, “Sleep is upon us, let us sit
together<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7724" id="noteref-7724" epub:type="noteref">7724</a> and talk.” Hereupon he who was afore returned to him
who was abaft the ship<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7725" id="noteref-7725" epub:type="noteref">7725</a> and they sat side by side in converse,
while the woman in the cabin sat listening to them.——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the two sons
forgathered in converse while the mother was listening and anon
quoth the elder to the younger, “Allah upon thee, O Wazir of the
Left, do thou relate to me whatso befel and betided thee in thy
time and what was the true cause of thy coming to this city; nor
conceal from me aught.” “By Allah, O Wazir of the Right,” quoth
the other, “my tale is wondrous and mine adventure marvellous
and were it paged upon paper the folk would talk thereanent race
after race.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7726" id="noteref-7726" epub:type="noteref">7726</a> “And what may that be?” asked he, and the other
answered, “’Tis this. My sire was son to a mighty merchant who
had of moneys and goods and estates and such like what pens
may not compute and which intelligence may not comprehend.
Now this my grandsire was a man whose word was law and every
day he held a Divan wherein the traders craved his counsel about
taking and giving and selling and buying; and this endured until
what while a sickness attacked him and he sensed his end drawing
near. So he summoned his son and charged him and insisted
thereon as his last will and testament that he never and by no
means make oath in the name of Allah or truly or falsely.” Now
the younger brother had not ended his adventure before the elder
Wazir threw himself upon him and flinging his arms around his
neck cried, “Walláhi, thou art my brother by father and mother!”
and when the woman heard these words of the twain her wits
wandered for joy, but she kept the matter hidden until morning.
The two Wazirs rejoiced in having found each of them a long-lost
brother and slumber fled their eyes till dawned the day when
the woman sent for the Captain and as soon as he appeared said
to him, “Thou broughtest two men to protect me but they caused
me only trouble and travail.” The man hearing these words
repaired forthright and reported them to the Sovran who waxed
madly wroth and bade summon his two Ministers and when they
stood between his hands asked them, “What was’t ye did in the
ship?” They answered, “By Allah, O King, there befel us
naught but every weal;” and each said, “I recognised this my
brother for indeed he is the son of the same parents,” whereat the
Sovran wondered and quoth he, “Laud to the Lord, indeed these
two Wazirs must have a strange story.” So he made them repeat
whatso they had said in the ship and they related to him their
adventure from beginning to end. Hereupon the King cried,
“By Allah, ye be certainly my sons,” when lo and behold! the
woman came forwards and repeated to him all that the Wazirs had
related whereby it was certified that she was the King’s lost wife
and their lost mother.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7727" id="noteref-7727" epub:type="noteref">7727</a> Hereupon they conducted her to the
Harem and all sat down to banquet and they led ever after the
most joyous of lives. All this the King related to the Judge and
finally said, “O our lord the Kazi, such-and-such and so-and-so
befel until Allah deigned reunite me with my children and my
wife.”</p>
