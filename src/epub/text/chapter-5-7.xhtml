<p>A free boy and a slave-girl once learnt together in school, and
the boy fell passionately in love with the girl.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the lad
fell passionately in love with the slave-lass: so one day, when the
other boys were heedless, he took her tablet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2177" id="noteref-2177" epub:type="noteref">2177</a> and wrote on it these
two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">What sayest thou of him by sickness waste, ✿ Until he’s clean distraught for love of thee?</div>
      <div class="line">Who in the transport of his pain complains, ✿ Nor can bear load of heart in secrecy?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when the girl took her tablet, she read the verses written
thereon and understanding them, wept for ruth of him; then she
wrote thereunder these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An if we behold a lover love-fordone ✿ Desiring us, our favours he shall see:</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, what he wills of us he shall obtain, ✿ And so befal us what befalling be.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now it chanced that the teacher came in on them and taking
the tablet, unnoticed, read what was written thereon. So he was
moved to pity of their case and wrote on the tablet beneath those
already written these two couplets addressed to the girl:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Console thy lover, fear no consequence; ✿ He is daft with loving lowe’s insanity;</div>
      <div class="line">But for the teacher fear not aught from him; ✿ Love-pain he learnèd long before learnt ye.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Presently it so happened that the girl’s owner entered the school
about the same time and, finding the tablet, read the above verses
indited by the boy, the girl and the schoolmaster; and wrote under
them these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">May Allah never make you parting dree ✿ And be your censurer shamèd wearily!</div>
      <div class="line">But for the teacher ne’er, by Allah, eye ✿ Of mine beheld a bigger pimp than he!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he sent for the Kazi and witnesses and married them on the
spot. Moreover, he made them a wedding-feast and treated them
with exceeding munificence; and they ceased not abiding together
in joy and happiness, till there came to them the Destroyer of
delights and the Severer of societies. And equally pleasant is the
story of</p>
