			<h2 epub:type="title">Generous Dealing of Yahya Son of Khalid with a Man Who Forged a Letter in His Name</h2>

<p>There was between Yahyá bin Khálid and Abdullah bin Málik
al-Khuzá’i<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1882" id="noteref-1882" epub:type="noteref">1882</a> an enmity which they kept secret; the reason of the
hatred being that Harun al-Rashid loved Abdullah with exceeding
love, so that Yahya and his sons were wont to say that he had
bewitched the Commander of the Faithful. And thus they abode
a long while, with rancour in their hearts, till it fell out that the
Caliph invested Abdullah with the government of Armenia<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1883" id="noteref-1883" epub:type="noteref">1883</a> and
despatched him thither. Now soon after he had settled himself
in his seat of government, there came to him one of the people of
Irak, a man of good breeding and excellent parts and abundant
cleverness; but he had lost his money and wasted his wealth and
his estate was come to ill case; so he forged a letter to Abdullah
bin Malik in the name of Yahya bin Khalid and set out therewith
for Armenia. Now when he came to the Governor’s gate, he
gave the letter to one of the Chamberlains, who took it and carried
it to his master. Abdullah opened it and read it and, considering
it attentively, knew it to be forged; so he sent for the
man, who presented himself before him and called down blessings
upon him and praised him and those of his court. Quoth Abdullah
to him, “What moved thee to weary thyself on this wise and bring
me a forged letter? But be of good heart; for we will not disappoint
thy travail.” Replied the other, “Allah prolong the life
of our lord the Wazir! If my coming annoy thee, cast not about
for a pretext to repel me, for Allah’s earth is wide and He who
giveth daily bread still liveth. Indeed, the letter I bring thee from
Yahya bin Khalid is true and no forgery.” Quoth Abdullah, “I
will write a letter to my agent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1884" id="noteref-1884" epub:type="noteref">1884</a> at Baghdad and command him
enquire concerning this same letter. If it be true, as thou sayest,
and genuine and not forged by thee, I will bestow on thee the
Emir-ship of one of my cities; or, if thou prefer a present, I will
give thee two hundred thousand dirhams, besides horses and camels
of price and a robe of honour. But, if the letter prove a forgery,
I will order thou be beaten with two hundred blows of a stick
and thy beard be shaven.” So Abdullah bade confine him in a
chamber and furnish him therein with all he needed, till his case
should be made manifest. Then he despatched a letter to his
agent at Baghdad, to the following effect:—“There is come to me
a man with a letter purporting to be from Yahya bin Khalid.
Now I have my suspicions of this letter: therefore delay thou not
in the matter, but go thyself and look carefully into the case and
let me have an answer with all speed, in order that we may know
what is true and what is untrue.” When the letter reached Baghdad,
the agent mounted at once——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the agent
of Abdullah son of Malik al-Khuza’i, on receipt of the letter at
Baghdad, mounted at once and repaired to the house of Yahya bin
Khalid, whom he found sitting with his officers and boon-companions.
After the usual salute he gave him the letter and Yahya
read it and said to the agent, “Come back to me to-morrow for
my written answer.” Now when the agent had gone away, Yahya
turned to his companions and said, “What doth he deserve who
forgeth a letter in my name and carrieth it to my foe?” They
answered all and each, saying this and that, and every one proposing
some kind of punishment; but Yahya said, “Ye err in that
ye say and this your counsel is of the baseness of your spirits and
the meanness of your minds. Ye all know the close favour of
Abdullah with the Caliph and ye weet of what is between him and
us of anger and enmity; and now Almighty Allah hath made this
man the means of reconciliation between us; and hath fitted him
for such purpose and hath appointed him to quench the fire of ire
in our hearts, which hath been growing these twenty years; and
by his means our differences shall be adjusted. Wherefore it behoveth
me to requite such man by verifying his assertion and
amending his estate; so I will write him a letter to Abdullah
son of Malik, praying that he may use him with increase of honour
and continue to him his liberality.” Now when his companions
heard what he said, they called down blessings on him and marvelled
at his generosity and the greatness of his magnanimity.
Then he called for paper and ink and wrote Abdullah a letter in
his own hand, to the following effect:—“In the name of Allah, the
Compassionating, the Compassionate! Of a truth thy letter hath
reached me (Allah give thee long life!) and I am glad to hear of
thy safety and am pleased to be assured of thine immunity and
prosperity. It was thy thought that a certain worthy man had
forged a letter in my name and that he was not the bearer of any
message from the same; but the case is not so, for the letter I
myself wrote, and it was no forgery; and I hope, of thy courtesy
and consideration and the nobility of thy nature, that thou wilt
gratify this generous and excellent man of his hope and wish, and
honour him with the honour he deserveth and bring him to his
desire and make him the special object of thy favour and munificence.
Whatso thou dost with him, it is to me that thou dost the
kindness, and I am thankful to thee accordingly.” Then he superscribed
the letter and after sealing it, delivered it to the agent, who
despatched it to Abdullah. Now when the Governor read it, he
was charmed with its contents, and sending for the man, said to
him, “Whichever of the two promised boons is the more acceptable
to thee that will I give thee.” The man replied, “The money
gift were more acceptable to me than aught else,” whereupon
Abdullah ordered him two hundred thousand dirhams and ten
Arab horses, five with housings of silk and other five with richly
ornamented saddles, used in state processions; besides twenty
chests of clothes and ten mounted white slaves and a proportionate
quantity of jewels of price. Moreover, he bestowed on him a
dress of honour and sent him to Baghdad in great splendour. So
when he came thither, he repaired to the door of Yahya’s house,
before he went to his own folk, and craved permission to enter and
have audience. The Chamberlain went in to Yahya and said to
him, “O my lord, there is one at the door who craveth speech of
thee; and he is a man of apparent wealth, courteous in manner,
comely of aspect and attended by many servants.” Then Yahya
bade admit him; and, when he entered and kissed the ground
before him, Yahya asked him, “Who art thou?” He answered,
“Hear me, O my lord, I am he who was done dead by the
tyranny of fortune, but thou didst raise me to life again from the
grave of calamities and exalt me to the paradise of my desires. I
am the man who forged a letter in thy name and carried it to
Abdullah bin Malik al-Khuza’i.” Yahya asked, “How hath he
dealt with thee and what did he give thee?”; and the man
answered, “He hath given me, thanks to thy hand and thy great
liberality and benevolence and to thy comprehensive kindness
and lofty magnanimity and thine all-embracing generosity, that
which hath made me a wealthy man and he hath distinguished
me with his gifts and favours. And now I have brought all
that he gave me and here it is at thy door; for it is thine to
decide and the command is in thy hand.” Rejoined Yahya,
“Thou hast done me better service than I did thee and I owe
thee a heavy debt of gratitude and every gift the white hand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1885" id="noteref-1885" epub:type="noteref">1885</a>
can give, for that thou hast changed into love and amity the hate
and enmity that were between me and a man whom I respect
and esteem. Wherefore I will give thee the like of what Abdullah
bin Malik gave thee.” Then he ordered him money and horses
and chests of apparel, such as Abdullah had given him; and thus
that man’s fortune was restored to him by the munificence of
these two generous ones. And folk also relate the tale of the</p>
