			<p>The Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, went out one day, with Abu Ya’Kúb the cup-companion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2213" id="noteref-2213" epub:type="noteref">2213</a> and Ja’afar the Barmecide and Abu Nowas, into the desert, where they fell in with an old man, propt against his ass. The Caliph bade Ja’afar learn of him whence he came; so he asked him, “Whence comest thou?” and he answered, “From Bassorah.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

When I have followed it, if Allah grant me recovery, I will give thee a slave-girl, who shall serve thee in thy lifetime a service, wherewith Allah shall cut short thy term; and when thou diest and the Lord hurrieth thy soul to hell-fire, she shall blacken thy face with her skite, of her mourning for thee, and shall keen and beat her face, saying:—O frosty-beard, what a fool thou wast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2216" id="noteref-2216" epub:type="noteref">2216</a>?” Thereupon Harun al-Rashid laughed till he fell backward, and ordered the Badawi three thousand silver pieces.
