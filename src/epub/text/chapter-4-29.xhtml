<p>It is related that Alá al-Dín, Chief of Police at Kús,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2040" id="noteref-2040" epub:type="noteref">2040</a> was sitting
one night in his house, when behold, a personage of handsome
appearance and dignified aspect came to the door, accompanied
by a servant bearing a chest upon his head and, standing there
said to one of the Wali’s young men, “Go in and tell the Emir
that I would have audience of him on some privy business.” So
the servant went in and told his master, who bade admit the
visitor. When he entered, the Emir saw him to be a man of
handsome semblance and portly presence; so he received him
with honour and high distinction, seating him beside himself, and
said to him, “What is thy wish?” Replied the stranger, “I am
a highwayman and am minded to repent at thy hands and turn to
Almighty Allah; but I would have thee help me to this, for that
I am in thy district and under thine inspection. Now I have here
a chest, wherein are matters worth some forty thousand dinars;
and none hath so good a right to it as thou; so do thou take it
and give me in exchange a thousand dinars, of thine own monies
lawfully gotten, that I may have a little capital, to aid me in my
repentance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2041" id="noteref-2041" epub:type="noteref">2041</a> and save me from resorting to sin for my subsistence;
and with Allah Almighty be thy reward!” Speaking thus he
opened the chest and showed the Wali that it was full of trinkets
and jewels and bullion and ring-gems and pearls, whereat he was
amazed and rejoiced with great joy. So he cried out to his treasurer,
saying, “Bring hither a certain purse containing a thousand
dinars,”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wali
cried out to his treasurer, saying, “Bring hither a certain purse
containing a thousand dinars”; and gave it to the highwayman,
who took it and thanking him, went his way under cover of the
night. Now when it was the morrow, the Emir sent for the chief
of the goldsmiths and showed him the chest and what was therein;
but the goldsmith found it nothing but tin and brass, and the jewels
and bezel-stones and pearls all of glass; whereat the Wali was
sore chagrined and sent in quest of the highwayman; but none
could come at him. And men also tell the tale of</p>
