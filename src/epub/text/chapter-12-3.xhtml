			<h2 epub:type="title">Women’s Wiles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5885" id="noteref-5885" epub:type="noteref">5885</a></h2>

<p>On the following night Dunyazad said to her sister Shahrazad,
“O sister mine, an thou incline not unto sleep, prithee tell us a
tale which shall beguile our watching through the dark hours.”
She replied:—With love and gladness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5886" id="noteref-5886" epub:type="noteref">5886</a> It hath reached me,
O magnificent King, that whilome there was in the city of
Baghdad, a comely youth and a well-bred, fair of favour, tall of
stature, and slender of shape. His name was Alá al-Dín and
he was of the chiefs of the sons of the merchants and had a
shop wherein he sold and bought. One day, as he sat in his
shop, there passed by him a merry girl<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5887" id="noteref-5887" epub:type="noteref">5887</a> who raised her head
and casting a glance at the young merchant, saw written in
a flowing hand on the forehead<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5888" id="noteref-5888" epub:type="noteref">5888</a> of his shop door these words,
“<span class="sc">There be no craft save men’s craft, forasmuch as it
overcometh women’s craft.</span>” When she beheld this, she
was wroth and took counsel with herself, saying, “As my head
liveth, there is no help but I show him a marvel-trick of the wiles
of women and put to naught this his inscription!” Thereupon
she hied her home; and on the morrow she made her ready and
donning the finest of dress, adorned herself with the costliest of
ornaments and the highest of price and stained her hands with
Henna. Then she let down her tresses upon her shoulders and
went forth, walking with coquettish gait and amorous grace,
followed by her slave-girl carrying a parcel, till she came to the
young merchant’s shop and sitting down under pretext of seeking
stuffs, saluted him with the salam and demanded of him somewhat
of cloths. So he brought out to her various kinds and she
took them and turned them over, talking with him the while.
Then said she to him, “Look at the shapeliness of my shape and
my semblance! Seest thou in me aught of default?” He
replied, “No, O my lady;” and she continued, “Is it lawful in any
one that he should slander me and say that I am humpbacked?”
Then she discovered to him a part of her bosom, and when he
saw her breasts his reason took flight from his head and his heart
clave to her and he cried, “Cover it up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5889" id="noteref-5889" epub:type="noteref">5889</a> so may Allah veil thee!”
Quoth she, “Is it fair of any one to decry my charms?” and
quoth he, “How shall any decry thy charms, and thou the sun of
loveliness?” Then said she, “Hath any the right to say of me
that I am lophanded?” and tucking up her sleeves, she showed
him forearms as they were crystal; after which she unveiled to
him a face, as it were a full moon breaking forth on its fourteenth
night, and said to him, “Is it lawful and right for any to decry
me and declare that my face is pitted with small-pox or that I
am one-eyed or crop-eared?” and said he, “O my lady, what is it
moveth thee to discover unto me that lovely face and those fair
limbs, wont to be so jealously veiled and guarded? Tell me the
truth of the matter, may I be thy ransom!” And he began to
improvise:—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5890" id="noteref-5890" epub:type="noteref">5890</a></p>

<p class="c015">——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say. Whereupon cried Dunyazad her sister,
“O sister mine, how delectable is this tale and how desirable!”
She replied, saying, “And where is this compared with that which
I will recount to thee next night, Inshallah?”</p>

</div>

</div>

<p>Now when came the night, quoth Dunyazad to her sister
Shahrazad, “O sister mine, an thou incline not unto sleep, prithee
finish thy tale which shall beguile our watching through the dark
hours.” She replied:—With love and gladness! It hath reached
me, O auspicious King, that the girl said to the young merchant,
“Know, O my lord, that I am a maid oppressed of my sire, who
speaketh at me and saith to me, Thou art loathly of looks and
semblance and it besitteth not that thou wear rich raiment; for
thou and the slave girls are like in rank, there is no distinguishing
thee from them. Now he is a richard, having a mighty great
store of money and saith not thus save because he is a pinchpenny,
and grudgeth the spending of a farthing; wherefore he is loath to
marry me, lest he be put to somewhat of expense in my marriage,
albeit Almighty Allah hath been bounteous to him and he is a
man puissant in his time and lacking naught of worldly weal.”
The youth asked, “Who is thy father and what is his condition?”
and she answered, “He is the Chief Kazi of the well-known
Supreme Court, under whose hands are all the Kazis who
administer justice in this city.” The merchant believed her and
she farewelled him and fared away, leaving in his heart a thousand
regrets, for that the love of her had prevailed over him and he
knew not how he should win to her; wherefore he woned
enamoured, love-distracted, unknowing if he were alive or dead.
As soon as she was gone, he shut up shop and walked straightway
to the Court, where he went in to the Chief Kazi and saluted him.
The magistrate returned his salam and treated him with distinction
and seated him by his side. Then said Ala al-Din to him,
“I come to thee seeking thine alliance and desiring the hand of thy
noble daughter.” Quoth the Kazi, “O my lord merchant, welcome
to thee and fair welcome; but indeed my daughter befitteth
not the like of thee, neither beseemeth she the goodliness of thy
youth and the pleasantness of thy composition and the sweetness
of thy speech;” but Ala al-Din replied, “This talk becometh
thee not, neither is it seemly in thee; if I be content with her,
how should this vex thee?” So the Kazi was satisfied and they
came to an accord and concluded the marriage contract at a dower
precedent of five purses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5891" id="noteref-5891" epub:type="noteref">5891</a> ready money and a dower contingent of
fifteen purses, so it might be hard for him to put her away, her
father having given him fair warning, but he would not be warned.
Then they wrote out the contract-document and the merchant said
“I desire to go in to her this night.” Accordingly they carried
her to him in procession that very evening, and he prayed the
night-prayer and entered the private chamber prepared for him;
but, when he lifted the head-gear from the bride’s head and the
veil from her face and looked, he saw a foul face and a favour right
fulsome; indeed he beheld somewhat whereof may Allah never
show thee the like! loathly, dispensing from description, inasmuch
as there were reckoned in her all legal defects.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5892" id="noteref-5892" epub:type="noteref">5892</a> So he repented,
when repentance availed him naught, and knew that the girl had
cheated him.——And Shaharazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say. Whereupon cried Dunyazad,
her sister, “O sister mine, how delectable is thy story and how
sweet!” She replied, saying, “And where is this compared with
that which I will recount to thee next night an I be spared and
suffered to live by the King, whom Almighty Allah preserve?”</p>

    <div>The Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night.</div>

</div>

<p>Now whenas came the night, quoth Dunyazad to her sister
Shahrazad, “O sister mine, an thou incline not unto sleep, prithee
finish thy story which shall beguile our watching through the dark
hours, for indeed ’tis a fine tale and a wondrous.” She replied:—With
love and gladness! It hath reached me, O generous King,
that the unhappy merchant carnally knew the loathly bride, sore
against the grain, and abode that night troubled in mind, as he were
in the prison of Al-Daylam.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5893" id="noteref-5893" epub:type="noteref">5893</a> Hardly had the day dawned when
he arose from her side and betaking himself to one of the
Hammams, dozed there awhile, after which he made the Ghusl-ablution
of ceremonial impurity<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5894" id="noteref-5894" epub:type="noteref">5894</a> and donned his every day dress.
Then he went out to the coffee house and drank a cup of coffee;
after which he returned to his shop and opening the door, sat down,
with concern and chagrin manifest on his countenance. After
an hour or so, his friends and intimates among the merchants and
people of the market began to come up to him, by ones and twos;
to give him joy, and said to him, laughing, “A blessing! a
blessing! Where be the sweetmeats? Where be the coffee?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5895" id="noteref-5895" epub:type="noteref">5895</a>
’Twould seem thou hast forgotten us; and nothing made thee
oblivious save that the charms of the bride have disordered thy
wit and taken thy reason, Allah help thee! We give thee joy, we
give thee joy.” And they mocked at him whilst he kept silence
before them, being like to rend his raiment and shed tears for
rage. Then they went away from him, and when it was the hour
of noon, up came his mistress, the crafty girl, trailing her skirts
and swaying to and fro in her gait, as she were a branch of Ban in
a garden of bloom. She was yet more richly dressed and adorned
and more striking and cutting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5896" id="noteref-5896" epub:type="noteref">5896</a> in her symmetry and grace than on
the previous day, so that she made the passers stop and stand in
espalier to gaze upon her. When she came to Ala al-Din’s shop,
she sat down thereon and said to him, “Blessed be the day to thee,
O my lord Ala al-Din! Allah prosper thee and be good to thee and
perfect thy gladness and make it a wedding of weal and welfare!”
He knitted his brows and frowned in answer to her; then asked her,
“Wherein have I failed of thy due, or what have I done to harm thee,
that thou shouldst requite me after this fashion?” She answered,
“Thou hast been no wise in default; but ’tis yonder inscription written
on the door of thy shop that irketh me and vexeth my heart. An
thou have the courage to change it and write up the contrary thereof,
I will deliver thee from thine evil plight.” And he answered, “Thy
requirement is right easy: on my head and eyes!” So saying
he brought out a sequin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5897" id="noteref-5897" epub:type="noteref">5897</a> and summoning one of his Mamelukes,
said to him, “Get thee to Such-an-one the Scribe and bid him
write us an epigraph, adorned with gold and lapis lazuli, in these
words, <span class="sc">There be no craft save women’s craft, for indeed
their craft is a mighty craft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5898" id="noteref-5898" epub:type="noteref">5898</a> and overcometh and
humbleth the falses of men</span>.” And she said to the white
slave, “Fare thee forthright.” So he repaired to the Scribe, who
wrote him the scroll, and he brought it to his master, who set it
on the door and asked the damsel, “Is thy heart satisfied?” She
answered, “Yes! Arise forthwith and get thee to the place
before the citadel, where do thou foregather with all the mountebanks
and ape-dancers and bear-leaders and drummers and pipers
and bid them come to thee to-morrow early, with their kettle-drums
and flageolets, whilst thou art drinking coffee with thy
father-in-law the Kazi, and congratulate thee and wish thee joy,
saying:—A blessing, O son of our uncle! Indeed, thou art the vein<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5899" id="noteref-5899" epub:type="noteref">5899</a>
of our eye! We rejoice for thee, and if thou be ashamed of us,
verily we pride ourselves upon thee; so, although thou banish us
from thee, know that we will not forsake thee, albeit thou forsake
us. And do thou fall to throwing dinars and dirhams amongst
them; whereupon the Kazi will question thee, and do thou
answer him, saying:—My father was an ape-dancer and this is our
original condition; but our Lord opened on us the gate of fortune
and we have gotten us a name amongst the merchants and with
their provost. Upon this he will say to thee, Then thou art an
ape-leader of the tribe of the mountebanks? and do thou rejoin,
I may in nowise deny my origin, for the sake of thy daughter and
in her honour. The Kazi will say, It may not be that thou shalt
be given the daughter of a Shaykh who sitteth upon the carpet of
the Law and whose descent is traceable by genealogy to the loins
of the Apostle of Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5900" id="noteref-5900" epub:type="noteref">5900</a> nor is it meet that his daughter be in
the power of a man who is an ape-dancer, a minstrel. Then do
thou reply, Nay, O Efendi, she is my lawful wife, and every hair of
her is worth a thousand lives, and I will not put her away though I
be given the kingship of the world. At last be thou persuaded
to speak the word of divorce and so shall the marriage be voided
and ye be saved each from other.” Quoth Ala al-Din, “Right is
thy rede,” and locking up his shop, betook himself to the place——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say. Whereupon cried Dunyazad, her sister, “O sister
mine, how goodly is thy story and how sweet!” She replied,
saying, “And where is this compared with that which I will
recount to thee next night, Inshallah!”</p>

</div>

<p>And whenas came the night, quoth Dunyazad to her sister, “O
sister mine, an thou incline not unto sleep, pray finish thy tale
which shall beguile our watching through the dark hours.” She
replied:—With love and gladness! It hath reached me, O
generous King, that the young merchant betook himself to the
place before the citadel, where he foregathered with the dancers,
the drummers and pipers and instructed them how they should do,
promising them a mighty fine reward. They received his word
with “Hearing and obeying;” and he betook himself on the
morrow, after the morning prayer, to the presence of the Judge,
who received him with humble courtesy and seated him by his
side. Then he addressed him and began questioning him of
matters of selling and buying and of the price current of the
various commodities which were carried to Baghdad from all
quarters, whilst his son-in-law replied to all whereof he was questioned.
As they were thus conversing, behold, up came the
dancers and drummers with their drums and pipers with their
pipes, whilst one of their number preceded them, with a long
pennon-like banner in his hand, and played all manner antics with
voice and limbs. When they came to the Court-house, the Kazi
cried, “I seek refuge with Allah from yonder Satans!” and the
young merchant laughed but said naught. Then they entered
and saluting his worship the Kazi, kissed Ala al-Din’s hands and
said, “A blessing on thee, O son of our uncle! Indeed, thou
coolest our eyes in whatso thou doest, and we beseech Allah for the
enduring greatness of our lord the Kazi, who hath honoured us by
admitting thee to his connection and hath allotted to us a portion
in his high rank and degree.” When the Judge heard this talk, it
bewildered his wit and he was dazed and his face flushed with
rage, and quoth he to his son-in-law, “What words are these?”
Quoth the merchant, “Knowest thou not, O my lord, that I am of
this tribe? Indeed this man is the son of my maternal uncle and
that other the son of my paternal uncle, and if I be reckoned of
the merchants, ’tis but by courtesy!” When the Kazi heard
these words his colour changed——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day, whereupon cried Dunyazad her sister “O sister mine,
how delectable is thy story and how desirable!” She replied,
saying, “And where is its first compared with its last? But I will
forthwith relate it to you an I be spared and suffered to live by
the King, whom may Allah the Most High keep!” Quoth the
King within himself, “By the Almighty, I will not slay her until I
hear the end of her tale!”</p>

<p>Now whenas came the night, quoth Dunyazad to her sister, “O
sister mine, an thou incline not unto sleep, prithee finish thy
tale which shall beguile our watching through the dark hours.”
She replied:—With love and gladness! It hath reached me,
O auspicious king, that the Kazi’s colour changed and he was
troubled and waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and was
like to burst for stress of rage. Then said he to the young
merchant, “Allah forfend that this should last! How shall
it be permitted that the daughter of the Kazi of the Moslems
cohabit with a man of the dancers and vile of origin? By
Allah, unless thou repudiate her forthright, I will bid beat
thee and cast thee into prison and there confine thee till thou
die. Had I foreknown that thou wast of them, I had not
suffered thee near me, but had spat in thy face, for that thou
art more ill-omened than a dog or a hog.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5901" id="noteref-5901" epub:type="noteref">5901</a> Then he kicked him
down from his place and commanded him to divorce; but he said,
“Be ruthful to me, O Efendi, for that Allah is ruthful, and hasten
not: I will not divorce my wife, though thou give me the kingdom
of Al-Irak.” The Judge was perplexed and knew that compulsion
was not permitted of Holy Law;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5902" id="noteref-5902" epub:type="noteref">5902</a> so he bespake the young
merchant fair and said to him, “Veil me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5903" id="noteref-5903" epub:type="noteref">5903</a> so may Allah veil thee.
An thou divorce her not, this dishonour shall cleave to me till the
end of time.” Then his fury gat the better of his wit and he
cried, “An thou divorce her not of thine own will, I will forthright
bid strike off thy head and slay myself; Hell-flame but not
shame.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5904" id="noteref-5904" epub:type="noteref">5904</a> The merchant bethought himself awhile, then divorced
her with a manifest divorce and a public<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5905" id="noteref-5905" epub:type="noteref">5905</a> and on this wise he won
free from that unwelcome worry. Then he returned to his shop
and presently sought in marriage of her father her who had done
with him what she did<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5906" id="noteref-5906" epub:type="noteref">5906</a> and who was the daughter of the Shaykh
of the guild of the blacksmiths. So he took her to wife and they
abode each with other and lived the pleasantest of lives and the
most delightsome, till the day of death: and praise be to Allah the
Lord of the Three Worlds.</p>
