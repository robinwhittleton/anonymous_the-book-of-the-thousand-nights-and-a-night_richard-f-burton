			<h2 epub:type="title">The Good Wife of Cairo and Her Four Gallants<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7454" id="noteref-7454" epub:type="noteref">7454</a></h2>

<p>It is said that in Misr lived a woman, a model of beauty and
loveliness and stature and perfect grace, who had a difficulty with a
man which was a Kazi and after this fashion it befel. She was the
wife of an Emir<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7455" id="noteref-7455" epub:type="noteref">7455</a> and she was wont to visit the Baths once a
month; and when the appointed term for her going forth had come,
she adorned herself and perfumed herself and beautified herself
and hastened, tripping and stumbling,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7456" id="noteref-7456" epub:type="noteref">7456</a> to the Hammám. Now
her path passed by the Kazi’s court-house where she saw many
a man<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7457" id="noteref-7457" epub:type="noteref">7457</a> and she stopped to enjoy the spectacle, upon which the
Judge himself glanced at her with a glance of eyes that bequeathed
to him a thousand sighs and he asked her saying, “O woman,
hast thou any want?” “No indeed,” answered she, “I have none.”
Then he inclined to her and drawing near her said, “O lady
mine and O light of these eyne, is union possible between us
twain?” She replied, “’Tis possible” and he enquired of her
when it could be, and she made an appointment with him saying,
“Do thou come to me after supper-time,”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I would
relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me to
survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Thirty-ninth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night.” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Goodwife
said to the Kazi, “Do thou come to me after supper-time,” and
went her ways and entered the Hammam, where she washed herself
and cleaned herself; then, coming out thence, she determined
to go home. But she was met on her road by a Gentleman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7458" id="noteref-7458" epub:type="noteref">7458</a> who
was Sháhbandar of the Trader-guild, and he seeing her set his
affections upon her; so he accosted her, saying, “Is’t possible that
we ever be merry together?” Hereat she appointed him to come
when supper was done, after which she left him and ganged her
gait. As she neared her home she was met by a Butcher whose
heart inclined to her, so he addressed her saying, “Is union possible?”
and she appointed him to visit her an hour after supper
had been eaten. Then she went home and mounting the stairs
took seat in the upper saloon open to the air, where she doffed
her head-veil<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7459" id="noteref-7459" epub:type="noteref">7459</a> and all that was upon her head. Now in the neighbourhood
of her house was a Trader and he had mounted to
the terrace-roof for a reason; so when the woman bared her
hair and taking up a comb began to dry and prepare it for
dressing, his eyes fell upon her whilst so engaged, and his heart
was engrossed with her love. Presently he sent to her an old
woman; and she returned him a reply and appointed him to visit
her house during the night after supper-tide. On this wise she had
promised herself to four men.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7460" id="noteref-7460" epub:type="noteref">7460</a> Now the Kazi had got ready for
her a Kohl-style and the Gentleman had prepared for her a fine
suit of clothes and the Butcher had led for her a full-sized ram
and the Trader had set apart for her two pieces of silk. As soon
as it was supper-time, behold, the Kazi repaired to her in privacy
bringing his gift and knocked at the door which he found unbolted
and she cried to him, “Come in.” Accordingly he entered
to her and presented to her that which was with him, but hardly
had he settled himself comfortably in his seat when the Gentleman
arrived and also rapped. Quoth the Kazi to the Goodwife,
“Who may this be?” and quoth she, “Fear thou nothing, but
arise and doff thy dress;” so he stripped himself altogether and
she garbed him in a gaberdine and bonnet<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7461" id="noteref-7461" epub:type="noteref">7461</a> and hid him in a closet
and went to open the door. Hereupon appeared the Consul and
she let him in and accepted what he had brought and seated
him beside her. But hardly had he settled down when, behold,
there came a knock at the door and he cried, “Who may that be?”
Said she, “Fear nothing but up and doff thy dress;” so he arose
and stripped himself and she disguised him in a gaberdine and
bonnet and hid him in another closet all alone. Then she
hastened to the door and suddenly the Flesher-man appeared and
she let him in and led him within and having accepted his present
seated him; but hardly was he at his ease when the door was again
knocked, whereat he was overcome and affrighted: however, she
said to him, “Fear nothing, but arise and doff thy dress in order
that I may hide thee.” So he threw off his clothes and she invested
him in a gaberdine and a bonnet and thrust him into a
third cabinet. After this she went and opened the door when
there came to her the Trader who was her neighbour, so she let
him in and took what was with him, and seated him; and he was
proceeding to sit down in comfort when behold, some one knocked
at the door and he said, “Who may that be?” Hereupon she
cried, “Oh my honour! Oh my calamity! This is my husband
who but yesterday<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7462" id="noteref-7462" epub:type="noteref">7462</a> killed off four men; however do thou rise up
and doff thy dress.” He did as she bade him, upon which she
garbed him in a gaberdine and a bonnet and laid him in a fourth
closet. So these four one and all found themselves in as many
cabinets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7463" id="noteref-7463" epub:type="noteref">7463</a> sorely sorrowful and fearful; but she went forth and
suddenly her mate the Emir came in and took seat upon a chair
that was in the house. Hereat all four sensed that she had opened
to her husband and had admitted him; and they said in their
minds, “Yesterday he killed four men and now he will kill me.”
And each and every considered his own affair and determined in
his mind what should happen to him from the husband. Such
was the case with these four; but as regards the house-master,
when he took seat upon the chair, he fell to chatting with his wife
and asking her saying, “What hast thou seen this day during thy
walk to the Hammam?” Said she, “O my lord, I have witnessed
four adventures and on every one hangeth a wondrous tale!” Now
when the four heard the Goodwife speaking these words each of
them said to himself, “Indeed I am a dead man and ’tis the
intention of this woman to peach upon me.” Presently her
husband asked her, “What be these four histories?” and answered
she, “I saw four men each and every of whom was an antic fellow,
a droll, a buffoon; furthermore, O my lord, one and all of them
were garbed in gaberdine and bonnet.”——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her
permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet
and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the Sovran suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the woman
said to her husband, “Moreover each of the four was habited in
gaberdine and bonnet.” But when the amourists heard these
words every one of them said to himself, “Here be a judgment
this strumpet of a woman hath wrought upon us, the whore! the
witch!” and her husband understanding what she told him asked,
“Wherefore didst thou not bring them hither that the sight might
solace us?” “O my lord,” answered she, “had I brought them
what hadst thou said to them? indeed I fear me thou wouldst
have slain them!” And he, “No indeed; I would not have
killed them, for they are but buffoon-folk, and we should have
enjoyed their harlequinades and would have made them dance to
us a wee and all and some tell us tales to gladden our minds;
after which we would have suffered them depart and go about
their own business.” The wife enquired, “And given that they
knew neither dancing nor story-telling what hadst thou done with
them?” and replied he, “Had the case been as thou sayest and
they ignorant of all this, verily we would have killed them and
cast them into the chapel of ease.” The four men hearing such
threatening words muttered to themselves, “There is no Majesty
and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great;”
but the Kazi said in his mind, “How remain Judge of this city
when I shall have been found garbed in gaberdine and bonnet and
dancing and tale-telling? and indeed this is the greater death.
Allah bring to ruin this adulteress of a woman!” Then the
Flesher took thought as follows, “How shall I continue to be
Chief of the Butchers when I prance about with a bonnet on my
pate? this is indeed a painful penalty!” Then quoth the Gentleman,
the Consul, “How shall it be with me when I am seen
dancing and donning a bonnet? indeed death by the sword were
lighter than this!” Then muttered the Trader which was the
woman’s neighbour, “’Tis easier to kill myself with my own hand
than to endure all such ill.” Anon the woman said to her husband,
“Inshallah—God willing—on the morrow we will bring them
hither to thy house that we may solace ourselves therewith;” but
said he, “Walláhi, hadst thou brought them this night ’twere
better, for that to-morrow evening I have business in the house of
the Chief Emir.” Quoth she to him, “Now grant me immunity
and give me permission and I will arise and bring them to thee at
this moment, but each must come to thee alone and by himself.”
Quoth he, “O Woman, leave I do give thee and immunity I do
grant thee;” whereupon she rose without stay or delay and went
to the closet wherein was the Judge. Then she opened it and
entered, and taking him by the hand dragged him forward and
came out with him and set him before her spouse garbed as he was
in gaberdine and bonnet. The house-master scrutinised him and
was certified of his being the Kazi and said to him, “Blessed be
to thee, O our lord, this bonnet and this gaberdine which become
thee passing well.” But the Judge, as he stood before the presence
of the woman’s husband, bowed his front downwards and was
clothed as with a garment in the sweat of shame and was sore
abashed, when the Emir said to him, “O our lord the Kazi, do thou
dance for us a wee the baboon dance and rejoice us; after which
performance do thou tell us a tale that our breasts may thereby be
broadened.” But when the man said this to him, the Judge feared
for his life because he had heard and well remembered the words
of the householder and he fell to clapping his palms and prancing
to right and left. Hereupon the Emir laughed consumedly, he and
his wife, and they signed and signalled each to other deriding the
judicial dance, and the Kazi ceased not skipping, until he fell to
the floor for his fatigue. Hereupon the man said to him, “Basta!
Now tell us thy tale that we may rejoice thereat; then do thou
rise up and go about thy business.” “Hearkening and obedience,”
said the Judge and forthright he began to relate the adventure of</p>
