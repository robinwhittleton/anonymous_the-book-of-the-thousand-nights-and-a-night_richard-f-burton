			<h2 epub:type="title">Ibrahim of Mosul and the Devil<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3133" id="noteref-3133" epub:type="noteref">3133</a></h2>

<p>Quoth Abu Ishak Ibrahim al-Mausili:—I asked Al-Rashid once to
give me a day’s leave that I might be private with the people of my
household and my brethren, and he gave me leave for Saturday the
Sabbath. So I went home and betook myself to making ready meat
and drink and other necessaries and bade the doorkeepers shut the
doors and let none come in to me. However, presently, as I sat
in my sitting-chamber, with my women who were looking after
my wants, behold, there appeared an old man of comely and
reverend aspect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3134" id="noteref-3134" epub:type="noteref">3134</a> clad in white clothes and a shirt of fine stuff
with a doctor’s turband on his head and a silver-handled staff in
his hand, and the house and porch were full of the perfumes wherewith
he was scented. I was greatly vexed at his coming in to me
and thought to turn away the doorkeepers; but he saluted me
after the goodliest fashion and I returned his greeting and bade
him be seated. So he sat down and began entertaining me with
stories of the Arabs and their verses, till my anger left me and
methought my servants had sought to pleasure me by admitting a
man of such good breeding and fine culture. Then I asked him,
“Art thou for meat?”; and he answered, “I have no need of it.”
“And for drink?” quoth I, and quoth he, “That is as thou wilt.”
So I drank off a pint of wine and poured him out the like. Then
said he, “O Abu Ishak, wilt thou sing us somewhat, so we may
hear of thine art that wherein thou excellest high and low?” His
words angered me; but I swallowed my anger and taking the lute
played and sang. “Well done, O Abu Ishak!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3135" id="noteref-3135" epub:type="noteref">3135</a> said he; whereat
my wrath redoubled and I said to myself, “Is it not enough that
he should intrude upon me, without my leave, and importune me
thus, but he must call me by name, as though he knew not the
right way to address me?” Quoth he, “An thou wilt sing something
more we will requite thee.” I dissembled my annoyance
and took the lute and sang again, taking pains with what I sang
and rising thereto altogether, in consideration of his saying, “We
will requite thee.”——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c006">
    <div>Now when it was the Six Hundred and Eighty-eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the Shaykh said to Abu Ishak, “If thou wilt sing something more
we will requite thee,” I dissembled my annoyance (continued
Ibrahim) and, taking the lute, sang again with great attention to
my singing and rising altogether thereto, in consideration of his
saying, “We will requite thee.” He was delighted, and cried,
“Well done, O my lord!”; presently adding, “Dost thou give me
leave to sing?” “As thou wilt,” answered I, deeming him weak
of wit, in that he should think to sing in my presence, after that
which he had heard from me. So he took the lute and swept the
strings, and by Allah, I fancied they spoke in Arabic tongue, with
a sweet and liquid and murmurous voice; then he began and sang
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I bear a hurt heart, who will sell me for this ✿ A heart whole and free from all canker and smart?</div>
      <div class="line">Nay, none will consent or to barter or buy ✿ Such loss, ne’er from sorrow and sickness to part:</div>
      <div class="line">I groan wi’ the groaning of wine-wounded men ✿ And pine for the pining ne’er freeth my heart.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And by Allah, meseemed the doors and the walls and all that was
in the house answered and sang with him, for the beauty of his
voice, so that I fancied my very limbs and clothes replied to him,
and I abode amazed and unable to speak or move, for the trouble
of my heart. Then he sang these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Culvers of Liwa!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3136" id="noteref-3136" epub:type="noteref">3136</a> to your nests return; ✿ Your mournful voices thrill this heart of mine.</div>
      <div class="line">Then back a-copse they flew, and well-nigh took ✿ My life and made me tell my secret pine.</div>
      <div class="line">With cooing call they one who’s gone, as though ✿ Their breasts were maddened with the rage of wine:</div>
      <div class="line">Ne’er did mine eyes their like for culvers see ✿ Who weep yet tear-drops never dye their eyne.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And also these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Zephyr of Najd, when from Najd thou blow, ✿ Thy breathings heap only new woe on woe!</div>
      <div class="line">The turtle bespake me in bloom of morn ✿ From the cassia-twig and the willow-bough</div>
      <div class="line">She moaned with the moaning of love-sick youth ✿ And exposed love-secret I ne’er would show:</div>
      <div class="line">They say lover wearies of love when near ✿ And is cured of love an afar he go:</div>
      <div class="line">I tried either cure which ne’er cured my love; ✿ But that nearness is better than farness I know:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3137" id="noteref-3137" epub:type="noteref">3137</a></div>
      <div class="line">Yet,—the nearness of love shall no ’vantage prove ✿ An whoso thou lovest deny thee of love.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then said he, “O Ibrahim, sing this song after me, and preserving
the mode thereof in thy singing, teach it to thy slave-girls.”
Quoth I, “Repeat it to me.” But he answered, “There needs no
repetition; thou hast it by heart nor is there more to learn.”
Then he suddenly vanished from my sight. At this I was amazed
and running to my sword drew it and made for the door of the
Harim, but found it closed and said to the women, “What have
ye heard?” Quoth they, “We have heard the sweetest of singing
and the goodliest.” Then I went forth amazed, to the house-door
and, finding it locked, questioned the doorkeepers of the old man.
They replied, “What old man? By Allah, no one hath gone in
to thee this day!” So I returned pondering the matter, when,
behold, there arose from one of the corners of the house, a <span xml:lang="la">Vox et
præterea nihil</span>, saying, “O Abu Ishak, no harm shall befal thee.
’Tis I, Abú Murrah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3138" id="noteref-3138" epub:type="noteref">3138</a> who have been thy cup-companion this day,
so fear nothing!” Then I mounted and rode to the palace, where
I told Al-Rashid what had passed, and he said, “Repeat to me
the airs thou heardest from him.” So I took the lute and played
and sang them to him; for, behold, they were rooted in my heart.
The Caliph was charmed with them and drank thereto, albeit he
was no confirmed wine-bibber, saying, “Would he would some
day pleasure us with his company, as he hath pleasured thee!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3139" id="noteref-3139" epub:type="noteref">3139</a>
Then he ordered me a present and I took it and went away. And
men relate this story anent</p>
