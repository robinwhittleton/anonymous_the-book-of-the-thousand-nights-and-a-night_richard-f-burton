    <div><b>Here we begin with the aidance of Allah Almighty, the Tale of the Warlock and the Young Cook of Baghdad.</b><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7979" id="noteref-7979" epub:type="noteref">7979</a></div>

</div>

<p>It is related (and Allah is All-knowing!) of a certain man which
was a Warlock, that Destiny drave him from town to town until
at last he entered Baghdad-city and dismounted at a Khán of the
Khans where he spent the night of arrival. Then, rising betimes
next morning, he walked about the highways and wandered around
the lanes and he stinted not passing from market-street to market-street,
solacing himself with a sight of many places, till he reached
the Long Bazar, whence he could descry the whole site of the city.
Now he narrowly considered the land, and, lo and behold! it was
a capital sans peer amongst the cities, wherethrough coursed the
Dajlah River blended with the River Furát<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7980" id="noteref-7980" epub:type="noteref">7980</a> and over the united
stream were thrown seven bridges of boats; all these were bound
one to other for the folk to pass over on their several pursuits,
especially for the pleasure-seekers who fared forth to the palm-orchards
and the vergiers abounding in fruits while the birds were
hymning Allah, the Sole, the All-conquering. Now one day as this
Warlock was amusing himself amongst the markets he passed
by the shop of a Cook before whom were set for sale dressed
meats of all kinds and colours;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7981" id="noteref-7981" epub:type="noteref">7981</a> and, looking at the youth, he saw
that he was rising fourteen and beautiful as the moon on the
fourteenth night; and he was elegant and habited in a habit as it
had just come from the tailor’s hand for its purity and excellent fit,
and one had said that he (the artisan) had laboured hard thereat, for
the sheen of it shimmered like unto silver.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7982" id="noteref-7982" epub:type="noteref">7982</a> Then the Warlock
considering the face of this Cook saw his colour wan as the hue of
metal leaves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7983" id="noteref-7983" epub:type="noteref">7983</a> and he was lean of limb;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7984" id="noteref-7984" epub:type="noteref">7984</a> so he took station facing
him and said to him, “The Peace be upon thee, O my brother,”
and said the other in reply, “And upon thee be The Peace and
the ruth of Allah and His blessings: so well come to thee and
welcome and fair welcome. Honour me, O my lord, by suffering me
to serve thee with the noonday meal.” Hereat the Wizard entered
the shop and the Kitchener took up two or three platters white
as the whitest silver; and, turning over into each one a different
kind of meat set them between the hands of the stranger who said
to him, “Seat thee, O my son.” And when his bidding was
obeyed he added, “I see thee ailing and thy complexion is yellow
exceedingly: what be this hath affected thee and what is thy disorder
and what limb of thy limbs paineth thee and is it long since
thou art in such case?” Now when the Cook heard this say he
drew a sigh of regret from the depths of his heart and the soles of
his feet and quoth he weeping, “Allah upon thee, O my lord,
remind me not of that hath betided me!” But quoth the other
“Tell me what may be thy disease and whereof dost thou complain;
nor conceal from me thy pain; for that I am a physician
and by aidance of Allah an experienced; and I have a medicine
for thy malady.” Hereat the youth fell to moaning and groaning
and presently replied, “In very sooth, O my lord, I have nor pain
nor complaint, save that I am a lover.” The Warlock asked, “Art
thou indeed a lover?” whereto the Cook make answer, “And not
only a lover but a lover parted from his beloved.” “On whom
hangeth thy heart, say me?” continued the Mediciner and the
youth replied, “Leave me for the nonce till such time as I am quit
of my business, and return to me about mid-afternoon, that I may
inform thee of mine affair and acquaint thee with the case I am
in.” The Warlock rejoined, “Arise now to thy work lest it be
miswrought by loitering;” and so saying he ate whatso of meats
had been served up to him and fared forth to thread the Bazars of
Baghdad and solace himself by seeing the city. But when it was
the hour of Al-’Asr—the mid-afternoon prayer—he went back to
the Cook and found that by this time he had wrought all his work,
and as soon as the youth sighted him he rejoiced in him and his
spirits were cheered and he said in his mind, “Haply joy shall
come to me from the healing hand of this Mediciner;” so he shut
his shop and taking with him his customer hied him to his own
home. Now this young Kitchener was of amplest means which he
had inherited from either parent; so as soon as they entered his
quarters he served up food and the two ate and drank and were
gladdened and comforted. After this quoth the guest to his host,
“Now relate to me the manner of thy story and what is the cause
of thy disorder?” “O my lord,” quoth the youth, “I must inform
thee that the Caliph Al-Mu’tazid bi’llah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7985" id="noteref-7985" epub:type="noteref">7985</a> the Commander of the
Faithful, hath a daughter fair of favour, and gracious of gesture;
beautiful, delightsome and dainty of waist and flank, a maiden in
whom all the signs and signals of loveliness are present, and the
<i><span xml:lang="fr">tout ensemble</span></i> is independent of description: seer never saw her
like and relator never related of aught that eveneth her in stature
and seemlihead and graceful bearing of head.” Now albeit a store
of suitors galore, the grandees and the Kings, asked her from the
Caliph, her sire refused to part with her, nor gave her neither
would he give her to any one thereof. And every Friday when
fare the folk to the Mosques that they pray the prayers of
meeting-day, all the merchants and men who buy and sell and the
very artisans and what not, leave their shops and warehouses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7986" id="noteref-7986" epub:type="noteref">7986</a> and
taverns<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7987" id="noteref-7987" epub:type="noteref">7987</a> unbolted and wide open and flock to congregational devotions.
And at such time this rare maiden cometh down from her
palace and solaceth herself with beholding the Bazars and anon
she entereth the Hammam and batheth therein and straightway
goeth forth and fareth homewards. But one Friday said I to
myself, “I will not go to the Mosque, for I would fain look upon
her with a single look;” and when prayer-time came and the folk
flocked to the fane for divine service, I hid myself within my shop.
Presently that august damsel appeared with a comitive of forty
handmaidens all as full moons newly risen and each fairer than
her fellows, while she amiddlemost rained light upon them as she
were the irradiating sun; and the bondswomen would have kept
her from sight by thronging around her and they carried her
skirts by means of bent rods<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7988" id="noteref-7988" epub:type="noteref">7988</a> golden and silvern. I looked at
her but one look when straightway my heart fell in love to her
burning as a live coal and from mine eyes tears railed and until
now I am still in that same yearning, and what yearning!” And
so saying the youth cried out with an outcry whereby his soul was
like to leave his body. “Is this case still thy case?” asked the
Warlock, and the youth answered, “Yes, O my lord;” when the
other enquired, “An I bring thee and her together what wilt
thou give me?” and the young Cook replied, “My money and my
life which shall be between thy hands!” Hereupon quoth the
Mediciner, “Up with thee and bring me a phial of metal and
seven needles and a piece of fresh Lign-aloes;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7989" id="noteref-7989" epub:type="noteref">7989</a> also a bit of
cooked meat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7990" id="noteref-7990" epub:type="noteref">7990</a> and somewhat of sealing-clay and the shoulder-blade
of a sheep together with felt and sendal of seven kinds.”
The youth fared forth and did his bidding, when the Sage took
the shoulder-blades and wrote upon them Koranic versets and
adjurations which would please the Lord of the Heavens and,
wrapping them in felt, swathed them with silken stuff of seven-fold
sorts. Then, taking the phial he thrust the seven needles into the
green Lign-aloes and set it in the cooked meat which he made fast
with the sealing-clay. Lastly he conjured over these objects with a
Conjuration<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7991" id="noteref-7991" epub:type="noteref">7991</a> which was, “I have knocked, I have knocked at the
hall doors of Earth to summon the Jánn, and the Jánn have
knocked for the Jánn against the Shaytán.” Hereat appeared to
me the son of Al bin Imrán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7992" id="noteref-7992" epub:type="noteref">7992</a> with a snake and baldrick’d with a
basilisk and cried:—Who be this trader and son of a slave-girl
who hath knocked at the ground for us this evening? Then do
thou, O youth, reply:—I am a lover and of age youthful and my
love is to a young lady; and unto your gramarye I have had
recourse, O folk of manliness and generosity and masterful deeds:
so work ye with me and confirm mine affair and aid me in this
matter. See ye not how Such-an-one, daughter of Such-an-one,
oppression and wrong to me hath done, nor is she with me in
affection as she was anon? They shall answer thee:—Let it be,
as is said, in the tail;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7993" id="noteref-7993" epub:type="noteref">7993</a> then do thou set the objects upon a fire
exceeding fierce and recite then over them:—This be the business;
and were Such-an-one, daughter of Such-an-one, within the well of
Káshán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7994" id="noteref-7994" epub:type="noteref">7994</a> or in the city Ispahan or in the towns of men who with
cloaks buttoned tight and ever ready good-fame to blight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7995" id="noteref-7995" epub:type="noteref">7995</a> let her
come forth and seek union with the beloved. Whereto she will reply:—“Thou
art the lord and I am the bondswoman.” Now the youth
abode marvelling at such marvel-forms and the Warlock having
repeated to him these words three times, turned to him and said,
“Arise to thy feet and perfume and fumigate thy person and don
thy choicest dress and dispread thy bed, for at this very hour thou
shalt see thy mistress by thy side.” And so saying the Sage cast
out of hand the shoulder-blades and set the phial upon the fire.
Thereupon the youth arose without stay or delay and bringing a
bundle of raiment the rarest, he spread it and habited himself, doing
whatso the Wizard had bidden him; withal could he not believe
that his mistress would appear. However ere a scanty space of
time had elapsed, lo and behold! the young lady bearing her bedding<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7996" id="noteref-7996" epub:type="noteref">7996</a>
and still sleeping passed through the house-door and she was
bright and beautiful as the easting sun. But when the youth the
Cook sighted her, he was perplext and his wits took flight with his
sense and he cried aloud saying, “This be naught save a wondrous
matter!” “And the same,” quoth the Sage, “is that requiredst
thou.” Quoth the Cook, “And thou, O my lord, art of the
Hallows of Allah,” and kissed his hand and thanked him for his
kindly deed. “Up with thee and take thy pleasure,” cried the
Warlock; so the lover crept under the coverlet into the bed and
he threw his arms round the fair one and kissed her between the
eyes; after which he bussed her on the mouth. She sensed a
sensation in herself and straightway awaking opened her eyes and
beheld a youth embracing her, so she asked him, “Ho thou, who
art thou?” Answered he, “One by thine eyes a captive ta’en and
of thy love the slain and of none save thyself the fain.” Hereat
she looked at him with a look which her heart for love-longing
struck and again asked him, “O my beloved; say me then, who
art thou, a being of mankind or of Jánn-kind?” whereto he
answered, “I am human and of the most honourable.” She
resumed, “Then who was it brought me hither to thee?” and he
responded, “The Angels and the Spirits, the Jinns and the Jánn.”
“Then I swear thee, O my dearling,” quoth she, “that thou bid
them bear me hither to thine arms every night,” and quoth he,
“Hearkening and obeying, O my lady, and for me also this be the
bourne of all wishes.” Then, each having kissed other, they slept
in mutual embrace until dawn. But when the morning morrowed
and showed its sheen and shone, behold, the Warlock appeared
and, calling the youth who came to him with a smiling face, said
to him, “How was it with thy soul this night?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7997" id="noteref-7997" epub:type="noteref">7997</a> and both lovers
cried, “We were in the Garden of Paradise together with the Húr
and Ghilmán:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7998" id="noteref-7998" epub:type="noteref">7998</a> Allah requite thee for us with all weal.” Then
they passed into the Hammam and when they had bathed, the
youth said, “O my lord, what shall we do with the young lady
and how shall she hie to her household and what shall be the case
of me without her?” “Feel no grief,” said the other, “and quit
all care of anything: e’en as she came so shall she go; nor shall
any of Almighty Allah’s creatures know aught of her.” Hereat
the Sage dismissed her by the means which conveyed her, nor did
she cease to bear her bedding with her every night and to visit
the youth with all joyance and delight. Now after a few weeks had
gone by, this young lady happening to be upon the terrace-roof of
her palace in company with her mother, turned her back to the
sun, and when the heat struck her between the shoulders her belly
swelled; so her parent asked her, “O my daughter, what hast thou
that thou juttest out after this wise?” “I wot naught thereof,”
answered she; so the mother put forth her hand to the belly
of her child and found her pregnant; whereupon she screamed and
buffeted her face and asked, “Whence did this befal thee?” The
women-attendants all heard her cries and running up to her
enquired, “What hath caused thee, O our lady, such case as this?”
whereto she replied, “I would bespeak the Caliph.” So the
women sought him and said, “O our lord, thou art wanted by our
lady;” and he did their bidding and went to his wife, but at first
sight he noted the condition of his daughter and asked her, “What
is to do with thee and what hath brought on thee such calamity?”
Hereupon the Princess told him how it was with her and he
exclaimed as he heard it, “O my daughter, I am the Caliph and
Commander of the Faithful, and thou hast been sought to wife of
me by the Kings of the earth one and all, but thou didst not accept
them as connections and now thou doest such deed as this! I
swear the most binding of oaths and I vow by the tombs of my
sires and my grandsires, an thou say me sooth thou shalt be saved;
but unless thou tell me truth concerning whatso befel thee and
from whom came this affair and the quality of the man’s intention
theewards, I will slaughter thee and under earth I will sepulchre
thee.” Now when the Princess heard from her father’s mouth
these words and had pondered this swear he had sworn she
replied, “O my sire, albeit lying may save yet is truth-telling the
more saving side. Verily, O my father, ’tis some time before this
day that my bed beareth me up every night and carrieth me to a
house of the houses wherein dwelleth a youth, a model of beauty
and loveliness, who causeth every seer to languish; and he beddeth
with me and sleepeth by my side until dawn, when my couch
uplifteth me and returneth with me to the Palace: nor wot I the
manner of my going and the mode of my coming is alike unknown
to me.” The Caliph hearing these her words marvelled at this her
tale with exceeding marvel and fell into the uttermost of wonderment,
but bethinking him of his Wazir, a man of penetrative wit,
sagacious, astute, argute exceedingly, he summoned him to the
presence and acquainted him as soon as he came with this affair
and what had befallen his daughter; to wit, how she was borne
away in her bed without knowing whither or aught else. Quoth
the Minister after taking thought for a full-told hour, “O Caliph of
the Time and the Age, I have a device by whose virtue I do opine
we shall arrive at the stead whither wendeth the Princess;” and
quoth the Caliph, “What may be this device of thine?” “Bid
bring me a bag;” rejoined the Wazir, “which I will let fill with
millet;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7999" id="noteref-7999" epub:type="noteref">7999</a> so they brought him one and he after stuffing the same
with grain set it upon the girl’s bed and close to her where lay her
head, leaving the mouth open to the intent that when during the
coming night her couch might be carried away, the millet in going
and returning might be shed upon the path. “Allah bless thee,
Ho thou the Wazir!” cried the Caliph: “this device of thine is
passing good and fair fall it for a sleight than which naught can be
slyer and good luck to it for a proof than which naught can be
better proven.” Now as soon as it was even-tide, the couch was
carried off as had happened every night and the grain was strown
broadcast upon the path, like a stream, from the gateway of the
Palace to the door of the young Cook’s lodging, wherein the
Princess nighted as was her wont until dawn of day. And when
morn appeared the Sage came and carried off with him the youth
to the Hammam where he found privacy and said to him, “O my
son, an thou ask me aught touching thy mistress’s kith and kin, I
bid thee know that they have indeed discovered her condition and
against thee they have devised a device.” Exclaimed the youth,
“Verily we are Allah’s and unto Him are we returning! What
may be thy rede in this affair? An they slay me I shall be a
martyr on Allah’s path;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8000" id="noteref-8000" epub:type="noteref">8000</a> but do thou wend thy ways and save
thyself and may the Almighty requite thee with all of welfare;
thee, through whom mine every wish I have won, and the whole
of my designs I have fulfilled; after which let them do with me as
they desire.” The Warlock replied, “O my son, grieve not neither
fear, for naught shall befal thee of harm, and I purpose to show
thee marvels and miracles wroughten upon them.” When the
youth heard these words his spirits were cheered, and joying with
joy exceeding he replied, “Almighty Allah reward thee for me
with fullest welfare!” Then the twain went forth the Hammam
and hied them home. But as soon as morning morrowed, the
Wazir repaired to the Caliph; and, both going to the Princess
together, found her in her bower and the bag upon her bed clean
empty of millet, at sight of which the Minister exclaimed, “Now
indeed we have caught our debtor. Up with us and to horse, O
Caliph of the Age, and sum and substance of the Time and the
Tide, and follow we the millet and track its trail.” The Commander
of the Faithful forthright gave orders to mount, and the
twain, escorted by their host, rode forth on the traces of the grain
till they drew near the house, when the youth heard the jingle and
jangle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8001" id="noteref-8001" epub:type="noteref">8001</a> of horses’ tramp and the wrangle and cangle of men’s outcries.
Upon this said the Cook to the Warlock, “Here they draw
near to seize me, O my lord, what is there now for me to do?” and
said the other, “Rise and fill me an ewer with water; then mount
therewith to the terrace-roof and pour the contents round and
about the house, after which come down to me.” The youth did
his bidding, and meanwhile the Caliph and the Wazir and the
soldiery had approached the house when, lo and behold! the
site had become an island amiddlemost a main dashing with
clashing billows.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8002" id="noteref-8002" epub:type="noteref">8002</a> But when the Commander of the Faithful
sighted this sea, he was perplexed with mighty great perplexity
and enquired of the Wazir, “At what time did such great water
appear in this place?” The Minister replied, “I never knew that
here was any stream, albe well I wot that the Tigris river floweth
amiddlemost the capital; but this is a magical current.” So saying
he bade the soldiery urge their horses into the water sans fear,
and every one drave as he had directed until all who entered lost
their lives and a many of men where drowned. Hereupon cried
the Prince of True Believers, “O Wazir, we are about to destroy
our host and to fare with them!” and cried the other, “How shall
we act, O Caliph of the Age? Haply our first, nay our best way,
is to ask help of those within the house and grant to them
indemnity while they exchange words with us and we see anon
what will come of their affair.” “Do as beseemeth thee,” answered
the Prince of True Believers; whereupon the Minister commanded
his men to cry aloud upon the household and they sued
for help during a length of time. But the Sage, hearing their
shouts, said to the youth, “Arise and go up to the terrace and say
to the Caliph of the Age:—Thou art in safety; turn away thy
steps hence and presently we will meet thy Highness in health and
weal; otherwise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8003" id="noteref-8003" epub:type="noteref">8003</a> thy daughter shall be lost and thine army shall
be destroyed, and thou, O Commander of the Faithful, wilt depart
and return as one outdriven. Do thou wend thy ways: this be
not the mode of meeting us and in such manner there is no
management.” The Cook did as he was bidden, and when the
twain heard his words, quoth the Wazir to the Caliph, “Verily
these be naught save Magicians, otherwise they must be of the
fulsomest of the Jann, for indeed never heard we nor saw we aught
of this.” Hereupon the Prince of True Believers turned his back
upon the place and he sorrowful and strait of breast and disheartened
of heart; so he went down to his Palace and sat there
for a full-told hour when behold, the Warlock and the Cook
appeared before him. But as soon as they stood in the presence
the Caliph cried out, “O Linkman, bring me the head of yonder
youth from between his shoulders!” Hereupon the Executioner
came forward and tearing a strip off the youth’s robe-skirt
bandaged his eyes; then he walked thrice round about him
brandishing his blade over the victim’s head and lastly cried,
“O Caliph of the Age, shall I make away with this youth?”
Answered the Caliph, “Yes, after thou shalt have stricken off his
head.” Hearing this the Sworder raised his hand and smote,
when suddenly his grip was turned backwards upon a familiar
of his who stood beside him, and it lighted upon his neck
with such force that his head flew off and fell at the Caliph’s
feet. The King and the Wazir were perplexed at this affair,
and the former cried out, “What be this? Art gone blind, O
Bhang-eater, that thy stroke hath missed the mark and thou
hast not known thy familiar from this youth who kneeleth before
thee? Smite him without delay!” Hereupon the Linkman again
raised his hand to obey his lord, but the blow fell upon the neck
of his varlet and the head flew off and rolled at the feet of the
Caliph and his Chief Councillor. At this second mishap the wits of
all present were bewildered and the King cried, “What business
is this, O Wazir?” whereto the other made answer, “O Caliph of
the Time and rare gift of the Age and the Tide, what canst thou
do, O my lord, with such as these? And whoso availeth to take
away o’ nights thy daughter upon her bed and dispread a sea
around his house, the same also hath power to tear thy kingdom
from thy grasp; nay more, to practise upon thy life. Now ’tis my
rede that thou rise and kiss the hand of this Sage and sue his protection,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8004" id="noteref-8004" epub:type="noteref">8004</a>
lest he work upon us worse than this. Believe me, ’twere
better for thee, O my lord, to do as I bid thee and thus ’twill be
well for us rather than to rise up as adversaries of this man.”
Hearing such words from his Minister, the King bade them raise
the youth from the strip of blood-rug and remove the bandage
from before his eyes, after which he rose to his feet, and, kissing
the Warlock’s hand, said to him, “In very sooth we knew
thee not nor were we ware of the measure of thine excellence.
But, O teacher of the Time and sum and substance of revolving
Tide, why hast thou wrought to me on this wise in the matter
of my daughter and destroyed my servants and soldiers?” “O
Viceregent of Allah upon His Earth,” replied the Sage, “I am a
stranger, and having eaten bread and salt with this youth, I formed
friendship and familiarity with him: then, seeing his case which
was sad and his state which was marvellous as it had afflicted him
with sickness, I took compassion upon him; moreover I designed
to show you all what I am and what Almighty Allah hath taught
me of occult knowledge. Hitherto there hath been naught save
weal, and now I desire of thy favour that thou marry thy daughter
to this youth, my familiar, for that she suiteth none other save
himself.” Quoth the Caliph, “This proceeding I look upon as the
fittest and it besitteth us that we obey thy bidding.” Presently
he robed the youth with a sumptuous robe worth the kingdom of a
King, and commanded him to sit beside the presence and seated
the Sage upon a chair of ebony-wood. Now whilst they were in
converse the Warlock turned round and beheld arear of the Caliph
a hanging of sendal whereupon stood figured lions twain: so he
signed with his hand to these forms which were mighty huge of
limb and awesome to look upon, when each put forth his paw upon
his fellow and both roared with roars like unto the bellow of ear-rending
thunder. Hereat all present were perplext in the extreme
and were in admiration at that matter, and especially the Prince
of True Believers who cried, “O Wazir, what seest thou in this
business?” The Wazir replied, “O Caliph of the Age, verily
Allah Almighty to thee hath sent this Sage that He<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8005" id="noteref-8005" epub:type="noteref">8005</a> might
show thee such marvels as these.” Then the Warlock signalled
with his hand to the lions which shrank till they became as
cats which carried on the combat; and both Caliph and Wazir
wondered thereat with excessive wonderment. Anon quoth the
King to the Minister, “Bid the Sage display to us more of his
marvels;” and accordingly the Wazir obeyed his lord’s behest, and
the Warlock replied, “To hear is to obey.” He then said, “Bring
hither to me a chauldron full of water;” and when it was brought
he asked the Courtiers, “Which of you would divert himself?”
“I,” quoth the Wazir; when quoth the Sage, “Do thou rise to
thy feet and doff thy robes and gird thee with a zone:” whereto
said the other, “Bring me a waistcloth;” and when it was brought
he did therewith as he was bidden. Hereat said the Warlock,
“Seat thee in the centre of the chauldron;” so he plunged into
the water, but when he would have seated him amiddlemost thereof
as ordered he saw only that he had entered a sea dashing with
surges clashing wherein whoso goeth is lost to view, and whence
whoso cometh is born anew; and he fell to swimming from side to
side intending to issue forth, while the waves suffered him not to
make the shore. And while he was in this case behold, a billow
of the billows vomited<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8006" id="noteref-8006" epub:type="noteref">8006</a> him up from the sea to the strand and he
stood on dry land, when he surveyed his person and suddenly saw
that he had become a woman with the breasts of a woman and the
solution of continuity like a woman, and long black hair flowing
down to his heels even as a woman’s. Then said he to himself,
“O ill-omened diversion! What have I done with such unlucky
disport that I have looked upon this marvel and wonder of wonderments,
only to become a woman.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8007" id="noteref-8007" epub:type="noteref">8007</a> Verily we are Allah’s, and unto
Him shall we return;” adding as he took thought of the matter
and of what had befallen him, “There is no Majesty and there
is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great.” Presently a
Fisherman approached him and sighting a fair girl said, “This
be none other than a blessed day which Allah hath opened to us
with a beautiful maiden for quarry; and she is doubtless of the
Daughters of the Deep, whom Allah Almighty hath sent to us
that I may espouse her to my son.” Hearing these words said
the transformed to himself, “Now after being a Wazir I have
become a woman and this be for that as tit for tat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8008" id="noteref-8008" epub:type="noteref">8008</a> and the wight
furthermore desireth to see me married, and as for the Caliph and
the kingdom and the countries, who shall now be able to offer
them counsel?” But the Fisherman who for his joyance had no
stomach to ply his pursuit, as was his custom, forthwith arose and
taking with him the Daughter of the Deep led her to his house,
and on entering the door cried aloud to his wife, “This day hath
been a lucky for my fishing craft: during all these years it never
befel me to happen upon a Mermaid save on this best-omened of
all the days,” adding, “Where is thy son, to whom Allah hath sent
this Daughter of the Daughters of the Main; and hath made her
his portion and vouchsafed her to his service? for ’tis my design
to marry them.” Replied the woman, “He hath taken the beast<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8009" id="noteref-8009" epub:type="noteref">8009</a>
and hath fared forth to pasture it and plough therewith; but right
soon will he return.” And whilst they were thus conversing the
youth came forward, and the Wazir on sighting him groaned and
cried, “Well-away for me! this very night I shall become a bride
for this blamed lad<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8010" id="noteref-8010" epub:type="noteref">8010</a> to sleep withal. And if I say to them:—What
intent have ye? Ye are in meanness and misery<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8011" id="noteref-8011" epub:type="noteref">8011</a> while I am
Wazir to the Caliph; they will never believe me for that I have
become a woman, and all thereto appertaining now belongeth to
me. Alack and alas for that I did with mine own self; indeed
what business had I with such diversion?” Hereupon the fisherman
called out, “O my son, up with thee and straightway take
this Mermaid and marry her and abate her pucelage and be blessed
with her and enjoy thy joy with her during all the days of thy life-tide:
doubtless, O my child, thou art in all boon fortune, seeing
that what good befel thee never betided any before thee nor will
become the lot of one after thee.” So the youth arose and for his
delight hardly believing in his conquest, married her and lay with
her and did away her maidenhead and on that very night she conceived
by him. After nine months she bare him issue and the
couple ceased not to be after this fashion till she had become a
mother of seven. But the Wazir, of his stress and excess of the
trouble and the travail he endured, said to himself, “How long shall
last this toil and torment wherewith I am liver-smitten and that
too by mine own consent? So e’en will I arise and hie me to this
sea and hurl me thereinto and whatso shall become of me let it
be: haply I may find rest from these torments into which I have
fallen.” And forthright he arose and sought the shore and did as
he had devised, when a wave enveloped him and cast him deep
into the depths and he was like to choke, when suddenly his head
protruded from the chauldron and he was seated as before he had
ducked it. Hereupon he saw the Caliph sitting in state with the
Sage by his side and all the Lords of the land and the Notables of
the commons awaiting the end of his adventure. So he gazed at
them and showed a smiling face<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8012" id="noteref-8012" epub:type="noteref">8012</a> and laughed aloud when the
Prince of True Believers asked him saying, “What hast thou seen,
O Wazir?” So he repeated to the Sovran all he had sighted and
everything that had come down upon his head, presently adding,
“O Caliph of the Age and the sum and substance of the Time and
the Tide, what be these marvels wrought by this Sage? Verily I
have beheld the garths of Paradise<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8013" id="noteref-8013" epub:type="noteref">8013</a> with maidens of the Húr and
the youths of Heaven, and wonderments galore unlooked upon by
mankind at all, at all. But, an thou be pleased, O Commander of
the Faithful, to espy these rare spectacles and marvellous conditions
with thine own eyes, deign go down into the water; so shalt thou
divert thyself with peregrine matters and adventures seld-seen.”
The Sultan, delighted at this rede, arose and doffed his dress;
then, girding his loins with a zone, he entered the chauldron
whereat the Sage cried out to him, “O my lord, sit thee down and
duck thy head.” But when this was done the Caliph found himself
in a bottomless sea and wide-dispread and never at rest by any
manner of means, so he fell to swimming therein, when a huge
breaker threw him high ashore and he walked up the beach
mother-naked save for his zone. So he said in his mind, “Let me
see what hath been wrought with me by the Sage and the Wazir
who have thus practised upon me and have cast me in this place;
and haply they have married my daughter to the youth, and they
have stolen my kingdom, the Sage becoming Sultan in my stead.
And now let me ask myself, What had I to do with such damned
diversion as this?” But as he brooded over these thoughts and
the like of them behold, a bevy of maidens came forwards to fill
their pitchers from a fountain and a pool of sweet water lying
beside the sea; and sighting him they exclaimed, “Thou, who art
thou? say sooth be thou of mankind or rather haply of Jinn-kind?”
He replied, “I am a mortal and of the noblest-born;
withal I am a stranger in the land and I wot not whither I should
wend.” “Of what country art thou?” asked they, and he
answered, “I am from Baghdad.” “Up with thee,” quoth one of
the damsels, “to yonder knoll, then down to the flat on the further
side, and thou shalt sight a city whose name is ’Omán,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8014" id="noteref-8014" epub:type="noteref">8014</a> whereinto
do thou enter.” The Caliph did her bidding, and no sooner
had the people seen him stripped than they said one to other,
“This man is a merchant who hath been shipwrecked;” so they
gave him by way of alms-gift a Tobe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8015" id="noteref-8015" epub:type="noteref">8015</a> all tattered and torn wherewith
he veiled his shame. And after so doing he fell to wandering
about the city for pastime, and while walking about he passed into
a Bazar and there sighted a cook, before whom he stood open-mouthed
(for indeed famine had thinned him), and he bethought
him of what to do, and he knew not how to act. However the
cook at first sight was certified of his being a foreigner, and haply
a shipwrecked mariner so he asked him, “O my brother, why dost
thou not come in and sit thee down, for thou art a stranger and
without means; so in the way of Allah I would engage thy services
and will pay thee daily two dirhams to provide thee with meat
and drink.” Answered the Caliph, “Hearing and obeying,” after
which he abode with the cook and served him and stinted not
to serve him for a long time, saying in himself the while, “This
for that is tit for tat! and after the Caliphate and commandment
and happiness and honour, this day art thou left to lick the platters.
What had I to do with such diversion as this? Withal ’tis fairer
than the spectacle that anyone even my Wazir ever saw and the
more excellent, for that I after being the Caliph of the Age, and
the choice gift of the Time and Tide have now become the hireling
of a cook. Would to Heaven I wot the sin which brought
me hereto?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8016" id="noteref-8016" epub:type="noteref">8016</a> Now as he abode with the cook it befel him that
one day he threaded the Jewellers’ Bazar; for about that city
was a sea-site whereinto the duckers and divers went down and
whence they brought up pearls and corals and precious stones;
and as he stood in the market-place, quoth he to himself, “Let me
here become a broker in this market-street and find rest from
my groaning in labour and my licking of platters.” As soon as
morning morrowed he did on such wise, when suddenly a merchant
approached him, hending in hand a costly gem whose light
burned like a lamp or rather like a ray of sunshine, and ’twas
worth the tribute of Egypt and Syria. Hereat the Caliph marvelled
with exceeding marvel, and quoth he to the trader, “Say
me, wilt thou sell this jewel?” and quoth the other, “Yes.” So
the Sultan taking it from him went about with it amongst the
merchants, who seeing and considering it, wondered greatly at its
beauty. Accordingly they bid for it fifty thousand dinars, but
the royal broker ceased not to bear it about and the buyers
to increase their biddings till they offered an hundred thousand
gold pieces. Thereupon the Caliph returned with it to the owner
and accosted him saying, “Wilt thou sell it for the sum named?”
and when the merchant consented, he continued, “I now go to
receive its price, wherewith I will come back to thee.” Then the
broker went up to the buyer and said, “Bring hither its value and
set it in my hand;” but the man asked him, “Where be its
owner?” and the Caliph answered, “Its owner hath commissioned
me to receive its price, after which he will come and recover the
same from me.” However the bidder retorted, “This be not
fitting nor is it according to Holy Law: do thou bring me its
owner; then come and let him pouch the price, for ’tis he hath
sold it to me and thou art only our agent.” Hereupon the Caliph
went forth to seek the proprietor and wandered about a long
while without finding him; after which he again accosted the
purchaser, and said to him, “I am the rightful proprietor: place
the price in my hand.” The buyer arose to pay his debt, but
before so doing he considered the jewel and saw that it was a bit
of dark Sandarach;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8017" id="noteref-8017" epub:type="noteref">8017</a> whereat he was sore perplext and cried out
to the Caliph, “O Satan, dost thou palm off false wares, the
market-place of the merchants being under the orders of the
Sultan?” But when the traders heard these words, they flocked
around the pretended broker and having seized him they pinioned
his elbows and dragged him before the Sovran of that city who,
when they set the prisoner before him, asked, “What be the
offence of this man?” “O our honoured lord,” answered they,
“this wight palmeth off false wares and swindleth the traders in
the royal Bazar.” So the King commanded them to hang him,
whereat they charged his neck with chains and bared his head,
and bade the cryer cry, “This be his award and the least of
awards who forgeth counterfeits and who tricketh the merchant-folk
in the market-place of the Sultan.” Hereat quoth the Caliph
to himself, “I was not content with platter-licking, which now
appeareth to me a mighty pleasant calling but e’en I must become
a broker and die <em>sus. per coll</em>. This be for that tit for tat; however,
scant blame to the Time which hath charged me with this
work.” Now when they brought him to the hanging-place and
threw the loop around his neck and fell to hoisting him up, as he
rose from the ground his eyes were opened and he found himself
emerging from the chauldron, whilst the Wazir and the Sage and
the youth were sitting and considering him. And the Minister
catching sight of his lord sprang to his feet and kissed ground
before him, and laughed aloud, and the Commander of the Faithful
asked him, “Why this laughter?” Answered he, “O thou, the
Prince of True Believers and God-guarded Sovran, my laughter
and my gladness are for myself, seeing that I have recovered my
identity after becoming a woman and being wedded to a ploughman,
who eared the ground, and after bearing to him seven babes.”
Cried the Caliph, “Woe to thee, O dog, O son of a dog, thou
wast married and rejoicedst in children, whereas I this very
moment from the hanging-place have come down.” Then he
informed the Wazir of all that had befallen him and the Minister
did on like guise, whereat all those present laughed consumedly
and marvelled at the words of the Warlock, and his proficiency
in occult knowledge. Then the Kazi and witnesses were summoned
with their writing-gear and were bidden draw up the
marriage-contract of the young Cook and the Caliph’s daughter.
After this the Sage sojourned with the Commander of the
Faithful in highmost degree and most honourable dignity, and
they abode eating and drinking and living the most delectable of
lives and the most enjoyable with all manner of joy and jollity,
till came to them the Destroyer of delights
and the Divider of man’s days
and they departed life
one and all.</p>
