			<h2 epub:type="title">Tale of Ali Bin Bakkar and of Shams Al-Nahar</h2>

<p>It hath reached me, O august King, that in days of yore and in
times and ages long gone before, during the Caliphate of Harun
al-Rashid, there was a merchant who named his son Abú al-Hasan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1407" id="noteref-1407" epub:type="noteref">1407</a>
Ali bin Táhir; and the same was great of goods and grace, while
his son was fair of form and face and held in favour by all folk.
He used to enter the royal palace without asking leave, for all the
Caliph's concubines and slave-girls loved him, and he was wont to
be companion with Al-Rashid in his cups and recite verses to him
and tell him curious tales and witty. Withal he sold and bought
in the merchants' bazar, and there used to sit in his shop a youth
named Ali bin Bakkár, of the sons of the Persian Kings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1408" id="noteref-1408" epub:type="noteref">1408</a> who was formous
of form and symmetrical of shape and perfect of figure, with
cheeks red as roses and joined eyebrows; sweet of speech, laughing-lipped
and delighting in mirth and gaiety. Now it chanced
one day, as the two sat talking and laughing behold, there came up
ten damsels like moons, every one of them complete in beauty and
loveliness, and elegance and grace; and amongst them was a young
lady riding on a she-mule with a saddle of brocade and stirrups of
gold. She wore an outer veil of fine stuff, and her waist was girt
with a girdle of gold-embroidered silk; and she was even as saith
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Silky her skin and silk that zonèd waist; ✿ Sweet voice; words not o'er many nor too few:</div>
      <div class="line">Two eyes quoth Allah "Be," and they became; ✿ And work like wine on hearts they make to rue:</div>
      <div class="line">O love I feel! grow greater every night: ✿ O solace! Doom-day bring our interview.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when the <span xml:lang="fr">cortège</span> reached Abu al-Hasan's shop, she alighted
from her mule, and sitting down on the front board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1409" id="noteref-1409" epub:type="noteref">1409</a> saluted him,
and he returned her salam. When Ali bin Bakkar saw her, she
ravished his understanding and he rose to go away; but she said to
him, "Sit in thy place. We came to thee and thou goest away:
this is not fair!" Replied he, "O my lady, by Allah, I flee from
what I see; for the tongue of the case saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She is a sun which towereth high a-sky; ✿ So ease thy heart with cure by Patience lent:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou to her skyey height shalt fail to fly; ✿ Nor she from skyey height can make descent."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she heard this, she smiled and asked Abu al-Hasan, "What
is the name of this young man?"; who answered, "He is a
stranger;" and she enquired, "What countryman is he?"; whereto
the merchant replied, "He is a descendant of the Persian Kings;
his name is Ali son of Bakkar and the stranger deserveth honour."
Rejoined she, "When my damsel comes to thee, come thou at once
to us and bring him with thee, that we may entertain him in our
abode, lest he blame us and say:—There is no hospitality in the
people of Baghdad; for niggardliness is the worst fault a man can
have. Thou hearest what I say to thee and, if thou disobey me,
thou wilt incur my displeasure and I will never again visit thee or
salute thee." Quoth Abu al-Hasan, "On my head and my eyes:
Allah preserve me from thy displeasure, fair lady!" Then she rose
and went her way. Such was her case; but as regards Ali bin
Bakkar he remained in a state of bewilderment. Now after an hour
the damsel came to Abu al-Hasan and said to him, "Of a truth my
lady Shams al-Nahár, the favourite of the Commander of the Faithful,
Harun al-Rashid, biddeth thee to her, thee and thy friend, my
lord Ali bin Bakkar." So he rose and, taking Ali with him, followed
the girl to the Caliph's palace, where she carried them into a
chamber and made them sit down. They talked together awhile,
when behold, trays of food were set before them, and they ate and
washed their hands. Then she brought them wine, and they drank
deep and made merry; after which she bade them rise and carried
them into another chamber, vaulted upon four columns, furnished
after the goodliest fashion with various kinds of furniture, and
adorned with decorations as it were one of the pavilions of Paradise.
They were amazed at the rarities they saw; and, as they were
enjoying a review of these marvels, suddenly up came ten slave-girls,
like moons, swaying and swimming in beauty's pride, dazzling
the sight and confounding the sprite; and they ranged themselves
in two ranks as if they were of the black-eyed Brides of Paradise.
And after a while in came other ten damsels, bearing in their
hands lutes and divers instruments of mirth and music; and these,
having saluted the two guests, sat down and fell to tuning their
lute-strings. Then they rose and standing before them, played and
sang and recited verses: and indeed each one of them was a seduction
to the servants of the Lord. Whilst they were thus busied
there entered other ten damsels like unto them, high-bosomed
maids and of an equal age, with black eyes and cheeks like the
rose, joined eyebrows and looks languorous; a very fascination to
every faithful wight and to all who looked upon them a delight;
clad in various kinds of coloured silks, with ornaments that amazed
man's intelligence. They took up their station at the door, and
there succeeded them yet other ten damsels even fairer than they,
clad in gorgeous array, such as no tongue can say; and they also
stationed themselves by the doorway. Then in came a band of
twenty damsels and amongst them the lady, Shams al-Nahar
hight, as she were the moon among the stars swaying from side to
side, with luring gait and in beauty's pride. And she was veiled
to the middle with the luxuriance of her locks, and clad in a robe
of azure blue and a mantilla of silk embroidered with gold and
gems of price; and her waist was girt with a zone set with various
kinds of precious stones. She ceased not to advance with her
graceful and coquettish swaying, till she came to the couch that
stood at the upper end of the chamber and seated herself thereon.
But when Ali bin Bakkar saw her, he versified with these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Source of mine evils, truly, she alone 's, ✿ Of long love-longing and my groans and moans;</div>
      <div class="line">Near her I find my soul in melting mood, ✿ For love of her and wasting of my bones.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And finishing his poetry he said to Abu al-Hasan, "Hadst thou
dealt more kindly with me thou haddest forewarned me of these
things ere I came hither, that I might have made up my mind and
taken patience to support what hath befallen me." And he wept
and groaned and complained. Replied Abu al-Hasan, "O my
brother, I meant thee naught but good; but I feared to tell thee
this, lest such transport should betide thee as might hinder thee
from foregathering with her, and be a stumbling-block between
thee and her. But be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and
clear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1410" id="noteref-1410" epub:type="noteref">1410</a> for she to thee inclineth and to favour thee designeth."
Asked Ali bin Bakkar, "What is this young lady's name?"
Answered Abu al Hasan, "She is hight Shams al-Nahar, one of
the favourites of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid,
and this is the palace of the Caliphate." Then Shams al-Nahar
sat gazing upon the charms of Ali bin Bakkar and he upon hers, till
both were engrossed with love for each other. Presently she commanded
the damsels, one and all, to be seated, each in her rank
and place, and all sat on a couch before one of the windows, and
she bade them sing; whereupon one of them took up the lute and
began carolling:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Give thou my message twice ✿ Bring clear reply in trice!</div>
      <div class="line">To thee, O Prince of Beau- ✿ ty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1411" id="noteref-1411" epub:type="noteref">1411</a> with complaint I rise:</div>
      <div class="line">My lord, as heart-blood dear ✿ And Life's most precious prize!</div>
      <div class="line">Give me one kiss in gift ✿ Or loan, if thou devise:</div>
      <div class="line">And if thou crave for more ✿ Take all that satisfies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1412" id="noteref-1412" epub:type="noteref">1412</a></div>
      <div class="line">Thou <span xml:lang="fr">donn'st</span> me sickness-dress ✿ Thee with health's weed I bless.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Her singing charmed Ali bin Bakkar, and he said to her, "Sing
me more of the like of these verses." So she struck the strings
and began to chaunt these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">By stress of parting, O beloved one, ✿ Thou mad'st these eyelids torrent-race to run:</div>
      <div class="line">Oh gladness of my sight and dear desire, ✿ Goal of my wishes, my religion!</div>
      <div class="line">Pity the youth whose eyne are drowned in tears ✿ Of lover gone distraught and clean undone.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had finished her verses, Shams al-Nahar said to another
damsel, "Let us hear something from thee!" So she played a
lively measure and began these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">His<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1413" id="noteref-1413" epub:type="noteref">1413</a> looks have made me drunken, not his wine; ✿ His grace of gait disgraced sleep to these eyne:</div>
      <div class="line">Dazed me no cup, but cop with curly crop; ✿ His gifts overcame me not the gifts of vine:</div>
      <div class="line">His winding locks my patience-clue unwound: ✿ His robèd beauties robbed all wits of mine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Shams Al-Nahar heard this recital from the damsel, she
sighed heavily and the song pleased her. Then she bade another
damsel sing; so she took the lute and began chanting:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Face that with Sol in Heaven lamping vies; ✿ Youth-tide's fair fountain which begins to rise;</div>
      <div class="line">Whose curly side-beard writeth writ of love, ✿ And in each curl concealeth mysteries:</div>
      <div class="line">Cried Beauty, "When I met this youth I knew ✿ 'Tis Allah's loom such gorgeous robe supplies."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had finished her song, Ali bin Bakkar said to the slave-maiden
nearest him, "Sing us somewhat, thou O damsel." So she
took the lute and began singing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"Our trysting-time is all too short ✿ For this long coyish coquetry:</div>
      <div class="line">How long this 'Nay, Nay!' and 'Wait, wait?' ✿ This is not old nobility!</div>
      <div class="line">And now that Time deigns lend delight ✿ Profit of th' opportunity."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she ended, Ali bin Bakkar followed up her song with flowing
tears; and, as Shams al-Nahar saw him weeping and groaning
and complaining, she burned with love-longing and desire; and
passion and transport consumed her. So she rose from the sofa
and came to the door of the alcove, where Ali met her and they
embraced with arms round the neck, and fell down fainting in the
doorway; whereupon the damsels came to them and carrying
them into the alcove, sprinkled rose-water upon them both. When
they recovered, they found not Abu al-Hasan who had hidden
himself by the side of a couch, and the young lady said, "Where
is Abu al-Hasan?" So he showed himself to her from beside the
couch and she saluted him, saying, "I pray Allah to give me the
means of requiting thee, O kindest of men!" Then she turned
to Ali bin Bakkar and said to him, "O my lord, passion hath not
reached this extreme pass with thee without my feeling the like;
but we have nothing to do save to bear patiently what calamity
hath befallen us." Replied he, "By Allah, O my lady, union with
thee may not content me nor gazing upon thee assuage the fire
thou hast lighted, nor shall leave me the love of thee which hath
mastered my heart but with the leaving of my life." So saying,
he wept and the tears ran down upon his cheeks like thridded
pearls; and when Shams al-Nahar saw him weep, she wept for
his weeping. But Abu al-Hasan exclaimed, "By Allah, I wonder
at your case and am confounded at your condition; of a truth, your
affair is amazing and your chance dazing. What! this weeping
while ye are yet together: then how will it be what time ye are
parted and far separated?" And he continued, "Indeed, this is
no tide for weeping and wailing, but a season for meeting and
merry-making; rejoice, therefore, and take your pleasure and shed
no more tears!" Then Shams al-Nahar signed to a slave-girl,
who arose and presently returned with handmaids bearing a table,
whose dishes of silver were full of various rich viands. They set
the table before the pair and Shams al-Nahar began to eat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1414" id="noteref-1414" epub:type="noteref">1414</a> and
to place tid-bits in the mouth of Ali bin Bakkar; and they ceased
not so doing till they were satisfied, when the table was removed
and they washed their hands. Then the waiting-women fetched
censers with all manner of incense, aloe-wood and ambergris and
mixed scents; and sprinkling-flasks full of rose-water were also
brought and they were fumigated and perfumed. After this the
slaves set on vessels of graven gold, containing all kinds of sherbets,
besides fruits fresh and dried, that heart can desire and eye delight
in; and lastly one brought a flagon of carnelion full of old wine.
Then Shams al-Nahar chose out ten handmaids to attend on them
and ten singing women; and, dismissing the rest to their apartments,
bade some of those who remained strike the lute. They
did as she bade them and one of them began to sing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My soul to him who smiled back my salute, ✿ In breast reviving hopes that were no mo'e:</div>
      <div class="line">The hand o' Love my secret brought to light, ✿ And censor's tongues what lies my ribs below:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1415" id="noteref-1415" epub:type="noteref">1415</a></div>
      <div class="line">My tear-drops ever press twixt me and him, ✿ As though my tear-drops showing love would flow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had finished her singing, Shams al-Nahar rose and,
filling a goblet, drank it off, then crowned it again and handed
it to Ali bin Bakkar;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Fifty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shams
al-Nahar filled a goblet and handed it to Ali bin Bakkar; after
which she bade another damsel sing; and she began singing these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My tears thus flowing rival with my wine, ✿ Pouring the like of what fills cup to brink:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1416" id="noteref-1416" epub:type="noteref">1416</a></div>
      <div class="line">By Allah wot I not an run these eyne ✿ Wi' wine, or else it is of tears I drink.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when she ended her recitation, Ali bin Bakkar drained his
cup and returned it to Shams al-Nahar. She filled it again and
gave it to Abu al-Hasan who tossed it off. Then she took the
lute, saying, "None shall sing over my cup save myself;" so she
screwed up the strings and intoned these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The tears run down his cheeks in double row, ✿ And in his breast high flameth lover-lowe:</div>
      <div class="line">He weeps when near, a-fearing to be far; ✿ And, whether far or near, his tear-drops flow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And the words of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Our life to thee, O cup-boy Beauty-dight! ✿ From parted hair to calves; from black to white:</div>
      <div class="line">Sol beameth from thy hands, and from thy lips ✿ Pleiads, and full Moon through thy collar's night,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1417" id="noteref-1417" epub:type="noteref">1417</a></div>
      <div class="line">Good sooth the cups, which made our heads fly round, ✿ Are those thine eyes pass round to daze the sight:</div>
      <div class="line">No wonder lovers hail thee as full moon ✿ Waning to them, for self e'er waxing bright:</div>
      <div class="line">Art thou a deity to kill and quicken, ✿ Bidding this <span xml:lang="la">fere</span>, forbidding other wight?</div>
      <div class="line">Allah from model of thy form made Beau- ✿ ty and the Zephyr scented with thy sprite.</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art not of this order of human- ✿ ity but angel lent by Heaven to man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Ali bin Bakkar and Abu al-Hasan and those present heard
Shams al-Nahar's song, they were like to fly for joy, and sported
and laughed; but while they were thus enjoying themselves lo!
up came a damsel, trembling for fear and said, "O my lady, the
Commander of the Faithful's eunuchs are at the door, Afíf and
Masrúr and Marján<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1418" id="noteref-1418" epub:type="noteref">1418</a> and others whom wot I not." When they
heard this they were like to die with fright, but Shams al-Nahar
laughed and said, "Have no fear!" Then quoth she to the damsel,
"Keep answering them whilst we remove hence." And she caused
the doors of the alcove to be closed upon Ali and Abu al-Hasan,
and let down the curtains over the entrance (they being still
within); after which she shut the door of the saloon and went out
by the privy wicket into the flower-garden, where she seated herself
on a couch she had there and made one of the damsels knead
her feet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1419" id="noteref-1419" epub:type="noteref">1419</a> Then she dismissed the rest of her women to their
rooms and bade the portress admit those who were at the door;
whereupon Masrur entered, he and his company of twenty with
drawn swords. And when they saluted her, she asked, "Wherefore
come ye?"; whereto they answered, "The Commander of the
Faithful saluteth thee. Indeed he is desolated for want of thy
sight; he letteth thee know that this be to him a day of joy and
great gladness and he wisheth to seal his day and complete his
pleasure with thy company at this very hour. So say, wilt go to
him or shall he come to thee?" Upon this she rose and, kissing
the earth, replied, "I hear and I obey the commandment of the
Prince of True Believers!" Then she summoned the women
guards of her household and other slave-damsels, who lost no time
in attending upon her and made a show of obeying the Caliph's
orders. And albeit everything about the place was in readiness,
she said to the eunuchs, "Go to the Commander of the Faithful
and tell him that I await him after a little space, that I may make
ready for him a place with carpets and other matters." So they
returned in haste to the Caliph, whilst Shams al-Nahar, doffing her
outer gear, repaired to her lover, Ali bin Bakkar, and drew him to
her bosom and bade him farewell, whereat he wept sore and said,
"O my lady, this leave-taking will cause the ruin of my very self
and the loss of my very soul; but I pray Allah grant me patience
to support the passion wherewith he hath afflicted me!" Replied
she, "By Allah, none shall suffer perdition save I; for thou wilt
fare forth to the bazar and consort with those that shall divert
thee, and thy life will be sound and thy love hidden forsure; but I
shall fall into trouble and <span xml:lang="fr">tristesse</span> nor find any to console me,
more by token that I have given the Caliph a tryst, wherein haply
great peril shall betide me by reason of my love for thee and my
longing for thee and my grief at being parted from thee. For with
what tongue shall I sing and with what heart shall I present myself
before the Caliph? and with what speech shall I company the
Commander of the Faithful in his cups? and with what eyes shall
I look upon a place where thou art absent? and with what taste
shall I drink wine of which thou drinkest not?" Quoth Abu al-Hasan,
"Be not troubled but take patience and be not remiss in
entertaining the Commander of the Faithful this night, neither
show him any neglect, but be of good heart." Now at this juncture,
behold, up came a damsel, who said to Shams al-Nahar, "O
my lady, the Caliph's pages are come." So she hastily rose to her
feet and said to the maid, "Take Abu al-Hasan and his friend and
carry them to the upper balcony<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1420" id="noteref-1420" epub:type="noteref">1420</a> giving upon the garden and there
leave them till darkness came on; when do thou contrive to carry
them forth." Accordingly the girl led them up to the balcony
and, locking the door upon them both, went her way. As they sat
looking on the garden lo! the Caliph appeared escorted by near
an hundred eunuchs, with drawn swords in hand and girt about
with a score of damsels, as they were moons, all clad in the richest
of raiment and on each one's head was a crown set with jewels and
rubies; while each carried a lighted <span xml:lang="fr">flambeau</span>. The Caliph walked
in their midst, they encompassing him about on all sides, and
Masrur and Afíf and Wasíf<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1421" id="noteref-1421" epub:type="noteref">1421</a> went before him and he bore himself
with a graceful gait. So Shams al-Nahar and her maidens rose to
receive him and, meeting him at the garden-door, kissed ground
between his hands; nor did they cease to go before him till they
brought him to the couch whereon he sat down, whilst all the
waiting-women who were in the garden and the eunuchs stood
before him and there came fair handmaids and concubines holding
in hand lighted candles and perfumes and incense and instruments
of mirth and music. Then the Sovereign bade the singers sit
down, each in her place, and Shams al-Nahar came up and, seating
herself on a stool by the side of the Caliph's couch, began to converse
with him; all this happening whilst Abu al-Hasan and Ali
bin Bakkar looked on and listened, unseen of the King. Presently
the Caliph fell to jesting and toying with Shams al-Nahar and
both were in the highest spirits, glad and gay, when he bade them
throw open the garden pavilion. So they opened the doors and
windows and lighted the tapers till the place shone in the season
of darkness even as the day. Then the eunuchs removed thither
the wine-service and (quoth Abu al-Hasan) "I saw drinking-vessels
and rarities whose like mine eyes never beheld, vases of
gold and silver and all manner of noble metals and precious stones,
such as no power of description can describe, till indeed it seemed
to me I was dreaming, for excess of amazement at what I saw!"
But as for Ali bin Bakkar, from the moment Shams al-Nahar left
him, he lay strown on the ground for stress of love and desire;
and, when he revived, he fell to gazing upon these things that had
not their like and saying to Abu al-Hasan, "O my brother, I fear
lest the Caliph see us or come to know of our case; but the most
of my fear is for thee. For myself, of a truth I know that I am
about to be lost past recourse, and the cause of my destruction is
naught but love and longing and excess of desire and distraction,
and disunion from my beloved after union with her; but I beseech
Allah to deliver us from this perilous predicament." And they
ceased not to look out of the balcony on the Caliph who was
taking his pleasure, till the banquet was spread before him, when
he turned to one of the damsels and said to her, "O Gharám,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1422" id="noteref-1422" epub:type="noteref">1422</a> let
us hear some of thine enchanting songs." So she took the lute
and tuning it, began singing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The longing of a Bedouin maid, whose folks are far away, ✿ Who yearns after the willow of the Hejaz and the bay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1423" id="noteref-1423" epub:type="noteref">1423</a>—</div>
      <div class="line">Whose tears, when she on travellers lights, might for their water serve ✿ And eke her her passion, with its heat, their bivouc-fire purvey,—</div>
      <div class="line">Is not more fierce nor ardent than my longing for my love, ✿ Who deems that I commit a crime in loving him alway.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1424" id="noteref-1424" epub:type="noteref">1424</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Shams al-Nahar heard these verses she slipped off the
stool whereon she sat and fell to the earth fainting and became
insensible to the world around her; upon which the damsels came
and lifted her up. And when Ali Bin Bakkar saw this from the
balcony he also slipped down senseless, and Abu al-Hasan said,
"Verily Fate hath divided love-desire equally upon you twain!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1425" id="noteref-1425" epub:type="noteref">1425</a>
As he spoke lo! in came the damsel who had led them up to the
balcony and said to him, "O Abu al-Hasan, arise thou and thy
friend and come down, for of a truth the world hath waxed strait
upon us and I fear lest our case be discovered or the Caliph
become aware of you; unless you descend at once we are dead
ones." Quoth he, "And how shall this youth descend with me
seeing that he hath no strength to rise?" Thereupon the damsel
began sprinkling rose-water on Ali bin Bakkar till he came to his
senses, when Abu al-Hasan lifted him up and the damsel made
him lean upon her. So they went down from the balcony and
walked on awhile till the damsel opened a little iron door, and
made the two friends pass through it, and they came upon a bench
by the Tigris' bank. Thereupon the slave-girl clapped her hands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1426" id="noteref-1426" epub:type="noteref">1426</a>
and there came up a man with a little boat to whom said she,
"Take up these two young men and land them on the opposite
side." So both entered the boat and, as the man rowed off with
them and they left the garden behind them, Ali bin Bakkar looked
back towards the Caliph's palace and the pavilion and the grounds;
and bade them farewell with these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I offered <em>this</em> weak hand as last farewell, ✿ While to heart-burning fire <em>that</em> hand is guided:</div>
      <div class="line">O let not this end union! Let not this ✿ Be last provision for long road provided!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon the damsel said to the boatman, "Make haste with
them both." So he plied his oars deftly (the slave-girl being still
with them);——And Shahrazad perceived the dawning day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Fifty-fifth Night</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the boatman
rowed them towards the other bank till they reached it and landed,
whereupon she took leave of them, saying, "It were my wish not
to abandon you, but I can go no farther than this." Then she
turned back, whilst Ali bin Bakkar lay prostrate on the ground
before Abu al-Hasan and by no manner of means could he rise, till
his friend said to him, "Indeed this place is not sure and I fear
lest we lose our lives in this very spot, by reason of the lewd
fellows who infest it and highwaymen and men of lawlessness."
Upon this Ali bin Bakkar arose and walked a little but could not
continue walking. Now Abu al-Hasan had friends in that quarter;
so he made search for one of them, in whom he trusted, and who
was of his intimates, and knocked at the door. The man came
out quickly and seeing them, bade them welcome and brought
them into his house, where he seated them and talked with them
and asked them whence they came. Quoth Abu al-Hasan, "We
came out but now, being obliged thereto by a person with whom
I had dealings and who hath in his hands dirhams of mine. And
it reached me that he designed to flee into foreign parts with my
monies; so I fared forth to-night in quest of him, taking with
me for company this youth, Ali bin Bakkar; but, when we came
hoping to see the debtor, he hid from us and we could get no sight
of him. Accordingly we turned back, empty-handed without a
doit, but it was irksome to us to return home at this hour of the
night; so weeting not whither to go, we came to thee, well
knowing thy kindness and wonted courtesy." "Ye are welcome
and well come!" answered the host, and studied to do them
honour; so the twain abode with him the rest of their night and
as soon as the daylight dawned, they left him and made their
way back without aught of delay to the city. When they came
to the house of Abu al-Hasan, he conjured his comrade to enter;
so they went in and lying down on the bed, slept awhile. As
soon as they awoke, Abu al-Hasan bade his servants spread the
house with rich carpets, saying in his mind, "Needs must I divert
this youth and distract him from thinking of his affliction, for I
know his case better than another." Then he called for water for
Ali bin Bakkar who, when it was brought, rose up from his bed
and making his ablutions, prayed the obligatory prayers which he
had omitted for the past day and night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1427" id="noteref-1427" epub:type="noteref">1427</a>; after which he sat down
and began to solace himself by talking with his friend. When
Abu al-Hasan saw this, he turned to him and said, "O my lord, it
were fitter for thy case that thou abide with me this night, so thy
breast may be broadened and the distress of love-longing that is
upon thee be dispelled and thou make merry with us, so haply
the fire of thy heart may thus be quenched." Ali replied, "O my
brother, do what seemeth good to thee; for I may not on any
wise escape from what calamity hath befallen me; so act as
thou wilt." Accordingly, Abu al-Hasan arose and bade his
servants summon some of the choicest of his friends and sent
for singers and musicians who came; and meanwhile he made
ready meat and drink for them; so they sat eating and drinking
and making merry through the rest of the day till nightfall.
Then they lit the candles, and the cups of friendship and good
fellowship went round amongst them and the time passed
pleasantly with them. Presently, a singing-woman took the lute
and began singing:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I've been shot by Fortune, and shaft of eye ✿ Down struck me and parted from fondest friend:</div>
      <div class="line">Time has proved him foe and my patience failed, ✿ Yet I ever expected it thus would end.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Ali bin Bakkar heard her words, he fell to the earth in a
swoon and ceased not lying in his fainting fit till daybreak; and
Abu al-Hasan despaired of him. But, with the dawning, he came
to himself and sought to go home; nor could his friend hinder
him, for fear of the issue of his affair. So he made his servants
bring a she-mule and, mounting Ali thereon, carried him to his
lodgings, he and one of his men. When he was safe at home;
Abu al-Hasan thanked Allah for his deliverance from that sore
peril and sat awhile with him, comforting him; but Ali could
not contain himself, for the violence of his love and longing.
So Abu al-Hasan rose to take leave of him and return to his
own place.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Fifty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Abu
al-Hasan rose to take leave of him, Ali son of Bakkar exclaimed,
"O my brother, leave me not without news." "I hear and obey,"
replied the other; and forthwith went away and, repairing to his
shop, opened it and sat there all day, expecting news of Shams
al-Nahar. But none came. He passed the night in his own house
and, when dawned the day, he walked to Ali bin Bakkar's lodging
and went in and found him thrown on his bed, with his friends
about him and physicians around him prescribing something or
other, and the doctors feeling his pulse. When he saw Abu al-Hasan
enter he smiled, and the visitor, after saluting him, enquired
how he did and sat with him till the folk withdrew, when he said
to him, "What plight is this?" Quoth Ali bin Bakkar, "It was
bruited abroad that I was ill and my comrades heard the report;
and I have no strength to rise and walk so as to give him the lie
who noised abroad my sickness, but continue lying strown here as
thou seest. So my friends came to visit me; say, however, O my
brother, hast thou seen the slave-girl or heard any news of her?"
He replied, "I have not seen her, since the day we parted from her
on Tigris' bank;" and he presently added, "O my brother, beware
thou of scandal and leave this weeping." Rejoined Ali, "O my
brother, indeed, I have no control over myself;" and he sighed
and began reciting:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She gives her woman's hand a force that fails the hand of me, ✿ And with red dye on wrist she gars my patience fail and flee:</div>
      <div class="line">And for her hand she fears so sore what shafts her eyes discharge, ✿ She's fain to clothe and guard her hand with mail-ring panoply:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1428" id="noteref-1428" epub:type="noteref">1428</a></div>
      <div class="line">The leach in ignorance felt my pulse the while to him I cried, ✿ "Sick is my heart, so quit my hand which hath no malady:"</div>
      <div class="line">Quoth she to that fair nightly vision favoured me and fled, ✿ "By Allah picture him nor add nor 'bate in least degree!"</div>
      <div class="line">Replied the Dream, "I leave him though he die of thirst," I cry, ✿ "Stand off from water-pit and say why this persistency."</div>
      <div class="line">Rained tear-pearls her Narcissus-eyes, and rose on cheek belit ✿ She made my sherbet, and the lote with bits of hail she bit.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1429" id="noteref-1429" epub:type="noteref">1429</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when his recital was ended he said, "O Abu al-Hasan, I am
smitten with an affliction from which I deemed myself in perfect
surety, and there is no greater ease for me than death." Replied
he, "Be patient, haply Allah will heal thee!" Then he went out
from him and repairing to his shop opened it, nor had he sat long,
when suddenly up came the handmaid who saluted him. He
returned her salam and looking at her, saw that her heart was
palpitating and that she was in sore trouble and showed signs of
great affliction: so he said to her, "Thou art welcome and well come!
How is it with Shams al-Nahar?" She answered, "I will presently
tell thee, but first let me know how doth Ali bin Bakkar." So he told
her all that had passed and how his case stood, whereat she grieved
and sighed and lamented and marvelled at his condition. Then said
she, "My lady's case is still stranger than this; for when you went
away and fared homewards, I turned back, my heart beating hard on
your account and hardly crediting your escape. On entering I found
her lying prostrate in the pavilion, speaking not nor answering any,
whilst the Commander of the Faithful sat by her head not knowing
what ailed her and finding none who could make known to him
aught of her ailment. She ceased not from her swoon till midnight,
when she recovered and the Prince of the Faithful said to
her, What harm hath happened to thee, O Shams al-Nahar, and
what hath befallen thee this night? Now when she heard the
Caliph's words she kissed his feet and said, Allah make me thy
ransom, O Prince of True Believers! Verily a sourness of stomach
lighted a fire in my body, so that I lost my senses for excess of
pain, and I know no more of my condition. Asked the Caliph,
What hast thou eaten to-day?; and she answered, I broke my fast
on something I had never tasted before. Then she feigned to be
recovered and calling for a something of wine, drank it, and begged
the Sovereign to resume his diversion. So he sat down again on
his couch in the pavilion and the sitting was resumed; but when
she saw me, she asked me how you fared. I told her what I had
done with you both and repeated to her the verses which Ali bin
Bakkar had composed at parting-tide, whereat she wept secretly,
but presently held her peace. After awhile, the Commander of
the Faithful ordered a damsel to sing, and she began reciting:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Life has no sweet for me since forth ye fared; ✿ Would Heaven I wot how fare ye who forsake:</div>
      <div class="line">'Twere only fit my tears were tears of blood, ✿ Since you are weeping for mine absence sake.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But when my lady heard this verse she fell back on the sofa in a
swoon,"——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Fifty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the slave-girl
continued to Abu al-Hasan, "But when my lady heard this verse,
she fell back on the sofa in a swoon, and I seized her hand and
sprinkled rose-water on her face, till she revived, when I said to
her:—O my lady, expose not thyself and all thy palace containeth.
By the life of thy beloved, be thou patient! She replied:—Can
aught befal me worse than death which indeed I seek, for by Allah,
my ease is therein?" Whilst we were thus talking, another damsel
sang these words of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Quoth they, "Maybe that Patience lend thee ease!" ✿ Quoth I, "Since fared he where is Patience' place?"</div>
      <div class="line">Covenant he made 'twixt me and him, to cut ✿ The cords of Patience at our last embrace!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1430" id="noteref-1430" epub:type="noteref">1430</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And as soon as she had finished her verse Shams al-Nahar swooned
away once more, which when the Caliph saw, he came to her in
haste and commanded the wine to be removed and each damsel to
return to her chamber. He abode with her the rest of the night,
and when dawned the day, he sent for <span xml:lang="fr">chirurgeons</span> and leaches
and bade them medicine her, knowing not that her sickness
arose from love and longing. "I tarried with her till I deemed
her in a way of recovery, and this is what kept me from thee. I
have now left her with a number of her body-women, who were
greatly concerned for her, when she bade me go to you two and
bring her news of Ali bin Bakkar and return to her with the
tidings." When Abu al-Hasan heard her story, he marvelled and
said, "By Allah, I have acquainted thee with his whole case; so
now return to thy mistress; and salute her for me and diligently
exhort her to have patience and say to her:—Keep thy secret!;
and tell her that I know all her case which is indeed hard and one
which calleth for nice conduct." She thanked him and taking
leave of him, returned to her mistress. So far concerning her;
but as regards Abu al-Hasan, he ceased not to abide in his shop
till the end of the day, when he arose and shut it and locked it and
betaking himself to Ali bin Bakkar's house knocked at the door.
One of the servants came out and admitted him; and when
Ali saw him, he smiled and congratulated himself on his coming,
saying, "O Abu al-Hasan, thou hast desolated me by thine
absence this day; for indeed my soul is pledged to thee during
the rest of my time." Answered the other, "Leave this talk!
Were thy healing at the price of my hand, I would cut it off ere
thou couldst ask me; and, could I ransom thee with my life, I
had already laid it down for thee. Now this very day, Shams al-Nahar's
handmaid hath been with me and told me that what
hindered her coming ere this was the Caliph's sojourn with her
mistress; and she acquainted me with everything which had
betided her." And he went on to repeat to him all that the girl
had told him of Shams al-Nahar; at which Ali bin Bakkar lamented
sore and wept and said to him, "Allah upon thee, O my brother,
help me in this affliction and teach me what course I shall take.
Moreover, I beg thee of thy grace to abide with me this night,
that I may have the solace of thy society." Abu al-Hasan agreed
to this request, replying that he would readily night there; so they
talked together till eventide darkened, when Ali bin Bakkar
groaned aloud and lamented and wept copious tears, reciting these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thine image in these eyne, a-lip thy name, ✿ My heart thy home; how couldst thou disappear?</div>
      <div class="line">How sore I grieve for life which comes to end, ✿ Nor see I boon of union far or near.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And these the words of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She split my <span xml:lang="fr">casque</span> of courage with eye-swords that sorely smite; ✿ She pierced my patience' ring-mail with her shape like cane-spear light:</div>
      <div class="line">Patched by the musky mole on cheek was to our sight displayed ✿ Camphor set round with ambergris, light dawning through the night.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1431" id="noteref-1431" epub:type="noteref">1431</a></div>
      <div class="line">Her soul was sorrowed and she bit carnelion stone with pearls ✿ Whose unions in a sugred tank ever to lurk unite:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1432" id="noteref-1432" epub:type="noteref">1432</a></div>
      <div class="line">Restless she sighed and smote with palm the snows that clothe her breast, ✿ And left a mark whereon I looked and ne'er beheld such sight.</div>
      <div class="line">Pens, fashioned of her coral nails with ambergris for ink, ✿ Five lines on crystal page of breast did cruelly indite:</div>
      <div class="line">O swordsmen armed with trusty steel! I bid you all beware ✿ When she on you bends deadly glance which fascinates the sprite:</div>
      <div class="line">And guard thyself, O thou of spear! whenas she draweth near ✿ To tilt with slender quivering shape, likest the nut-brown spear.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Ali bin Bakkar ended his verse, he cried out with a
great cry and fell down in a fit. Abu al-Hasan thought that his
soul had fled his body and he ceased not from his swoon till daybreak,
when he came to himself and talked with his friend, who
continued to sit with him till the forenoon. Then he left him and
repaired to his shop; and hardly had he opened it, when lo! the
damsel came and stood by his side. As soon as he saw her, she
made him a sign of salutation which he returned; and she delivered
to him the greeting message of her mistress and asked, "How
doth Ali bin Bakkar?" Answered he, "O handmaid of good, ask
me not of his case nor what he suffereth for excess of love-longing;
he sleepeth not by night neither resteth he by day; wakefulness
wasteth him and care hath conquered him and his condition is a
consternation to his friend." Quoth she, "My lady saluteth thee
and him, and she hath written him a letter, for indeed she is in
worse case than he; and she entrusted the same to me, saying:—Do
not return save with the answer; and do thou obey my bidding.
Here now is the letter, so say, wilt thou wend with me to him that
we may get his reply?" "I hear and obey," answered Abu al-Hasan,
and locking his shop and taking with him the girl he went,
by a way different from that whereby he came, to Ali bin Bakkar's
house, where he left her standing at the door and walked in——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Fifty-eighth Night,</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu al-Hasan
went with the girl to the house of Ali son of Bakkar, where
he left her standing at the door and walked in to his great joy.
And Abu al-Hasan said to him, "The reason of my coming is that
such an one hath sent his handmaid to thee with a letter, containing
his greeting to thee and mentioning therein that the cause of
his not coming to thee was a matter that hath betided him. The
girl standeth even now at the door: shall she have leave to
enter?"; and he signed to him that it was Shams al-Nahar's slave-girl.
Ali understood his signal and answered, "Bring her in,"
and when he saw her, he shook for joy and signed to her, "How
doth thy lord?; Allah grant him health and healing!" "He is
well," answered she and pulling out the letter gave it to him. He
took it and kissing it, opened and read it; after which he handed
it to Abu al-Hasan, who found these verses written therein:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">This messenger shall give my news to thee; ✿ Patience what while my sight thou canst not see:</div>

      <div class="line">Look what befel thy wasted frame, and thence ✿ Argue what I am doomed for love to dree!</div>

had read this letter he said in weak accents and feeble voice,
"With what hand shall I write and with what tongue shall I make
moan and lament? Indeed she addeth sickness to my sickness
and draweth death upon my death!" Then he sat up and taking
in hand ink-case and paper, wrote the following reply:—"In the
name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1436" id="noteref-1436" epub:type="noteref">1436</a> Thy
letter hath reached me, O my lady, and hath given ease to a sprite
worn out with passion and love-longing, and hath brought healing
to a wounded heart cankered with languishment and sickness; for
indeed I am become even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Straitenèd bosom; reveries dispread; ✿ Slumberless eyelids; body wearièd;</div>
      <div class="line">Patience cut short; disunion longsomest; ✿ Reason deranged and heart whose life is fled!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And know that complaining is unavailing; but it easeth him
whom love-longing disordereth and separation destroyeth and,
with repeating:—Union, I keep myself comforted and how fine is
the saying of the poet who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Did not in love-plight joys and sorrows meet, ✿ How would the message or the writ be sweet?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he had made an end of this letter, he handed it to Abu al-Hasan,
saying, "Read it and give it to the damsel." So he took it
and read it and its words stirred his soul and its meaning wounded
his vitals. Then he committed it to the girl, and when she took it
Ali bin Bakkar said to her, "Salute thy lady for me and acquaint
her with my love and longing and how passion is blended with
my flesh and my bones; and say to her that in very deed I need a
woman who shall snatch me from the sea of destruction and save
me from this dilemma; for of a truth Fortune oppresseth me with
her vicissitudes; and is there any helper to free me from her turpitudes?"
And he wept and the damsel wept for his weeping.
Then she took leave of him and went forth and Abu al-Hasan
went out with her and farewelled her. So she ganged her gait
and he returned to his shop, which he opened and sat down there,
as was his wont;——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Abu
al-Hasan farewelled the slave-girl and returned to his shop
which he opened and sat down there according to his custom;
but as he tarried, he found his heart oppressed and his breast
straitened, and he was perplexed about his case. So he ceased
not from melancholy the rest of that day and night, and on the
morrow he betook himself to Ali bin Bakkar, with whom he sat
till the folk withdrew, when he asked him how he did. Ali began
to complain of desire and to descant upon the longing and distraction
which possessed him, and repeated these words of the
poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Men have 'plained of pining before my time, ✿ Live and dead by parting been terrified:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And these of another poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

      <div class="line">Yet I chase not the wildlings of wold and wild ✿ Like Kays, for madness is manifold.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon quoth Abu al-Hasan, "Never did I see or hear of one
like unto thee in thy love! When thou sufferest all this transport
and sickness and trouble being enamoured of one who returneth
thy passion, how would it be with thee if she whom thou lovest
were contrary and contumelious, and thy case were discovered
through her perfidy?" And Ali the son of Bakkar (says Abu
al-Hasan) was pleased with my words and he relied upon them
and he thanked me for what I had said and done. I had a friend
(continued Abu al-Hasan), to whom I discovered my affair and
that of Ali and who knew that we were intimates; but none other
than he was acquainted with what was betwixt us. He was wont
to come to me and enquire how Ali did and after a little, he began
to ask me about the damsel; but I fenced him off, saying, "She
invited him to her and there was between him and her as much
as can possibly take place, and this is the end of their affair;
but I have devised me a plan and an idea which I would submit
to thee." Asked his friend, "And what is that?" Answered
Abu al-Hasan, "I am a person well known to have much dealing
among men and women, and I fear, O my brother, lest the affair of
these twain come to light and this lead to my death and the
seizure of my goods and the rending of my repute and that of
my family. Wherefore I have resolved to get together my monies
and make ready forthright and repair to the city of Bassorah
and there abide, till I see what cometh of their case, that none
may know of me; for love hath lorded over both and correspondence
passeth between them. At this present their go-between
and confidante is a slave-girl who hath till now kept their counsel,
but I fear lest haply anxiety get the better of her and she discover
their secret to some one and the matter, being bruited
abroad, might bring me to great grief and prove the cause of my
ruin; for I have no excuse to offer my accusers." Rejoined his
friend, "Thou hast acquainted me with a parlous affair, from the
like of which the wise and understanding will shrink with fear.
Allah avert from thee the evil thou dreadest with such dread and
save thee from the consequences thou apprehendest! Assuredly
thy recking is aright." So Abu al-Hasan returned to his place
and began ordering his affairs and preparing for his travel; nor
had three days passed ere he made an end of his business and
fared forth Bassorah-wards. His friend came to visit him three
days after but finding him not, asked of him from the neighbours
who answered, "He set out for Bassorah three days ago, for he had
dealings with its merchants and he is gone thither to collect
monies from his debtors; but he will soon return." The young
man was confounded at the news and knew not whither to wend;
and he said in his mind, "Would I had not parted from Abu
al-Hasan!" Then he bethought him of some plan whereby
he should gain access to Ali bin Bakkar; so he went to his
lodging, and said to one of his servants, "Ask leave for me
of thy lord that I may go in and salute him." The servant
entered and told his master and presently returning, invited the
man to walk in. So he entered and found Ali bin Bakkar
thrown back on the pillow and saluted him. Ali returned his
greeting and bade him welcome; whereupon the young man
began to excuse himself for having held aloof from him all that
while and added, "O my lord, between Abu al-Hasan and myself
there was close friendship, so that I used to trust him with my
secrets and could not sever myself from him an hour. Now it
so chanced that I was absent three days' space on certain business
with a company of my friends; and, when I came back and
went to him, I found his shop locked up; so I asked the neighbours
about him and they replied:—He is gone to Bassorah.
Now I know he had no surer friend than thou; so, by Allah,
tell me what thou knowest of him." When Ali bin Bakkar heard
this, his colour changed and he was troubled and answered, "I
never heard till this day of his departure and, if the case be as
thou sayest, weariness is come upon me." And he began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">For joys that are no more I wont to weep, ✿ While friends and lovers stood by me unscattered;</div>
      <div class="line">This day when disunited me and them ✿ Fortune, I weep lost loves and friendship shattered.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he hung his head groundwards in thought awhile and presently
raising it and looking to one of his servants, said, "Go to
Abu al-Hasan's house and enquire anent him whether he be at home
or journeying abroad. If they say:—He is abroad; ask whither
he be gone." The servant went out and returning after a while
said to his master, "When I asked for Abu al-Hasan, his people
told me that he was gone on a journey to Bassorah; but I saw a
damsel standing at the door who, knowing me by sight, though I
knew her not, said to me:—Art thou not servant to Ali bin
Bakkar? Even so, answered I; and she rejoined:—I bear a
message for him from one who is the dearest of all folk to him.
So she came with me and she is now standing at the door." Quoth
Ali bin Bakkar, "Bring her in." The servant went out to her and
brought her in, and the man who was with Ali looked at her and
found her pretty. Then she advanced to the son of Bakkar and
saluted him——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixtieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
slave-girl came in to Ali bin Bakkar, she advanced to him and
saluted him and spake with him secretly; and from time to time
during the dialogue he exclaimed with an oath and swore that he
had not talked and tattled of it. Then she took leave of him and
went away. Now Abu al-Hasan's friend was a jeweller,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1438" id="noteref-1438" epub:type="noteref">1438</a> and
when she was gone, he found a place for speech and said to Ali
bin Bakkar, "Doubtless and assuredly the Caliph's household have
some demand upon thee or thou hast dealings therewith?" "Who
told thee of this?" asked Ali; and the jeweller answered, "I know
it by yonder damsel who is Shams al-Nahar's slave-girl; for she
came to me a while since with a note wherein was written that
she wanted a necklace of jewels; and I sent her a costly collar."
But when Ali bin Bakkar heard this, he was greatly troubled, so
that the jeweller feared to see him give up the ghost, yet after a
while he recovered himself and said, "O my brother, I conjure thee
by Allah to tell me truly how thou knowest her." Replied he,
"Do not press this question upon me;" and Ali rejoined, "Indeed,
I will not turn from thee till thou tell me the whole truth." Quoth
the jeweller, "I will tell thee all, on condition that thou distrust
me not, and that my words cause thee no restraint; nor will I
conceal aught from thee by way of secret but will discover to thee
the truth of the affair, provided that thou acquaint me with the
true state of thy case and the cause of thy sickness." Then he
told him all that had passed from first to last between Abu
al-Hasan and himself, adding, "I acted thus only out of friendship
for thee and of my desire to serve thee;" and assured him that
he would keep his secret and venture life and good in his service.
So Ali in turn told him his story and added, "By Allah, O my
brother, naught moved me to keep my case secret from thee and
from others but my fear lest folk should lift the veils of protection
from certain persons." Rejoined the jeweller, "And I desired not
to foregather with thee but of the great affection I bear thee and
my zeal for thee in every case, and my compassion for the anguish
thy heart endureth from severance. Haply I may be a comforter
to thee in the room of my friend, Abu al-Hasan, during the length
of his absence: so be thou of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool
and clear." Thereupon Ali thanked him and repeated these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"An say I:—Patient I can bear his faring, ✿ My tears and sighings give my say the lie;</div>
      <div class="line">How can I hide these tears that course adown ✿ This plain, my cheek, for friend too fain to fly?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he was silent awhile, and presently said to the jeweller
"Knowest thou what secret the girl whispered to me?" Answered
he, "Not I, by Allah, O my lord!" Quoth Ali, "She fancied
that I directed Abu al-Hasan to go to Bassorah and that I had
devised this device to put a stop to our correspondence and consorting.
I swore to her that this was on nowise so; but she would
not credit me and went away to her mistress, persisting in her
injurious suspicions; for she inclined to Abu al-Hasan and gave
ear to his word." Answered the young jeweller, "O my brother,
I understood as much from the girl's manner; but I will win for
thee thy wish, Inshallah!" Rejoined Ali bin Bakkar, "Who can
be with me in this and how wilt thou do with her, when she shies
and flies like a wildling of the wold?" Cried the jeweller "By
Allah, needs must I do my utmost to help thee and contrive to
scrape acquaintance with her without exposure or mischief!"
Then he asked leave to depart and Ali bin Bakkar said, "O my
brother, mind thou keep my counsel;" and he looked at him and
wept. The jeweller bade him good-bye and fared forth——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the jeweller
bade him good-bye and fared forth not knowing what he should
do to win for him his wishes; and he ceased not walking, while
over-musing the matter, till he spied a letter lying in the road. He
took it up and looked at its direction and superscription, then read
it and behold, it ran:—"From the least worthy of lovers to the
most worthy of beloveds." So he opened it and found these words
written therein:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"A messenger from thee came bringing union-hope, ✿ But that he erred somehow with me the thought prevailed;</div>
      <div class="line">So I rejoiced not; rather grew my grief still more; ✿ Weeting my messenger of wits and wit had failed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"But afterwards: Know, O my lord! that I ken not the reason
why our correspondence between thee and me hath been broken
off: but, if the cruelty arise from thy part, I will requite it with
fidelity, and if thy love have departed, I will remain constant to
my love of the parted, for I am with thee even as says the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Be proud; I'll crouch! Bully; I'll bear! Despise; I'll pray! ✿ Go; I will come! Speak; I will hear! Bid; I'll obey!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>As he was reading lo! up came the slave-girl, looking right and
left, and seeing the paper in the jeweller's hand, said to him, "O
my master, this letter is one I let fall." He made her no answer,
but walked on, and she walked behind him, till he came to his
house, when he entered and she after him, saying, "O my master,
give me back this letter, for it fell from me." Thereupon he turned
to her and said, "O handmaid of good, fear not neither grieve, for
verily Allah the Protector loveth those who protect; but tell me in
truthful way thy case, as I am one who keepeth counsel. I conjure
thee by an oath not to hide from me aught of thy lady's affairs;
for haply Allah shall help me to further her wishes and make easy
by my hand that which is hard." When the slave-girl heard these
words she said, "O my lord, indeed a secret is not lost whereof
thou art the secretist; nor shall any affair come to naught for
which thou strivest. Know that my heart inclineth to thee and
would interest thee with my tidings, but do thou give me the
letter." Then she told him the whole story, adding, "Allah is
witness to whatso I say." Quoth he, "Thou hast spoken truly, for
I am acquainted with the root of the matter." Then he told her
his tale of Ali bin Bakkar and how he had learned his state of
mind; and related to her all that had passed from first to last,
whereat she rejoiced; and they two agreed that she should take
the letter and carry it to Ali and return and acquaint the jeweller
with all that happened. So he gave her the letter and she took it
and sealed it up as it was before, saying, "My mistress Shams
al-Nahar gave it to me sealed; and when he hath read it and given
me its reply, I will bring it to thee." Then she took leave and
repaired to Ali bin Bakkar, whom she found waiting, and gave him
the letter. He read it and writing a paper by way of reply, gave
it to her; and she carried it to the jeweller, who tore asunder the
seal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1439" id="noteref-1439" epub:type="noteref">1439</a> and read it and found written therein these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"The messenger, who kept our commerce hid, ✿ Hath failed, and showeth wrath without disguise;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1440" id="noteref-1440" epub:type="noteref">1440</a></div>
      <div class="line">Choose one more leal from your many friends ✿ Who, truth approving, disapproves of lies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>"To proceed: Verily, I have not entered upon perfidy ✿ nor have
I abandoned fidelity ✿ I have not used cruelty ✿ neither have I
put off lealty ✿ no covenant hath been broken by me ✿ nor hath
love-tie been severed by me ✿ I have not parted from penitence ✿
nor have I found aught but misery and ruin after severance ✿ I
know nothing of that thou avouchest ✿ nor do I love aught but
that which thou lovest ✿ By Him who knoweth the secret of
hidden things none discover ✿ I have no desire save union with
my lover ✿ and my one business is my passion to conceal ✿ albeit
with sore sickness I ail ✿ This is the exposition of my case and
now all hail!" When the jeweller read this letter and learnt its
contents he wept with sore weeping, and the slave-girl said to him,
"Leave not this place till I return to thee; for he suspecteth me
of such and such things, in which he is excusable; so it is my
desire to bring about a meeting between thee and my mistress,
Shams al-Nahar, howsoever I may trick you to it. For the present
I left her prostrate, awaiting my return with the reply." Then
she went away and the jeweller passed the night with a troubled
mind. And when day dawned he prayed his dawn-prayer and
sat expecting the girl's coming; and behold, she came in to
him rejoicing with much joy and he asked her, "What news, O
damsel?" She answered, "After leaving thee I went to my mistress
and gave her the letter written by Ali bin Bakkar; and, when
she read it and understood it, she was troubled and confounded;
but I said to her:—O my lady, have no fear of your affair being
frustrated by Abu al-Hasan's disappearance, for I have found one
to take his place, better than he and more of worth and a good
man to keep secrets. Then I told her what was between thyself
and Abu al-Hasan and how thou camest by his confidence and
that of Ali bin Bakkar and how that note was dropped and thou
camest by it; and I also showed her how we arranged matters
betwixt me and thee." The jeweller marvelled with much wonder,
when she resumed, "And now my mistress would hear whatso
thou sayest, that she may be assured by thy speech of the
covenants between thee and him; so get thee ready to go with me
to her forthwith." When the jeweller heard the slave-girl's words,
he saw that the proposed affair was grave and a great peril to
brave, not lightly to be undertaken or suddenly entered upon, and
he said to her, "O my sister, verily, I am of the ordinary and not
like unto Abu al-Hasan; for he being of high rank and of well-known
repute, was wont to frequent the Caliph's household,
because of their need of his merchandise. As for me, he used to
talk with me and I trembled before him the while. So, if thy
mistress would speak with me, our meeting must be in some place
other than the Caliph's palace and far from the abode of the Commander
of the Faithful; for my common sense will not let me
consent to what thou proposest." On this wise he refused to go
with her and she went on to say that she would be surety for his
safety, adding, "Take heart and fear no harm!" and pressed him
to courage till he consented to accompany her; withal, his legs
bent and shivered and his hands quivered and he exclaimed,
"Allah forbid that I should go with thee! Indeed, I have not
strength to do this thing!" Replied she, "Hearten thy heart, if
it be hard for thee to go to the Caliph's palace and thou canst not
muster up courage to accompany me, I will make her come to
thee; so budge not from thy place till I return to thee with her."
Then the slave-girl went away and was absent for a while, but a
short while, after which she returned to the jeweller and said to
him, "Take thou care that there be with thee none save thyself,
neither man-slave nor girl-slave." Quoth he, "I have but a negress,
who is in years and who waiteth on me."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1441" id="noteref-1441" epub:type="noteref">1441</a> So she arose and locked
the door between his negress and the jeweller and sent his manservants
out of the place; after which she fared forth and presently
returned, followed by a lady who, entering the house, filled it with
the sweet scent of her perfumes. When the jeweller saw her, he
sprang up and set her a couch and a cushion; and she sat down while
he seated himself before her. She abode awhile without speaking
till she had rested herself, when she unveiled her face and it
seemed to the jeweller's fancy as if the sun had risen in his home.
Then she asked her slave-girl, "Is this the man of whom thou
spakest to me?" "Yes," answered she; whereupon the lady
turned to the jeweller and said to him, "How is it with thee?"
Replied he, "Right well! I pray Allah for thy preservation and
that of the Commander of the Faithful." Quoth she, "Thou hast
moved us to come to thee and possess thee with what we hold secret."
Then she questioned him of his household and family; and
he disclosed to her all his circumstance and his condition and said
to her, "I have a house other than this; and I have set it apart
for gathering together my friends and brethren; and there is none
there save the old negress, of whom I spoke to thy handmaid."
She asked him on what wise he came first to know how the affair
began and the matter of Abu al-Hasan and the cause of his wayfaring:
accordingly he told her all he knew and how he had
advised the journey. Thereupon she bewailed the loss of Abu al-Hasan
and said to the jeweller, "Know, O such an one,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1442" id="noteref-1442" epub:type="noteref">1442</a> that
men's souls are active in their lusts and that men are still men;
and that deeds are not done without words nor is end ever reached
without endeavour. Rest is won only by work"——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shams al-Nahar
thus addressed the jeweller, "Rest is gained only by work
and success is gendered only by help of the generous. Now I have
acquainted thee with our affair and it is in thy hand to expose us
or to shield us; I say no more, because thy generosity requireth
naught. Thou knowest that this my handmaiden keepeth my
counsel and therefore occupieth high place in my favour; and I
have selected her to transact my affairs of importance. So let
none be worthier in thy sight than she and acquaint her with thine
affair; and be of good cheer, for on her account thou art safe from
all fear, and there is no place shut upon thee but she shall open it
to thee. She shall bring thee my messages to Ali bin Bakkar and
thou shalt be our intermediary." So saying, she rose, scarcely
able to rise, and fared forth, the jeweller faring before her to the
door of her house, after which he returned and sat down again in
his place, having seen of her beauty and heard of her speech what
dazzled him and dazed his wit, and having witnessed of her grace
and courtesy what bewitched his sprite. He sat musing on her
perfections till his mind waxed tranquil, when he called for food
and ate enough to keep soul and body together. Then he changed
his clothes and went out; and, repairing to the house of the youth
Ali bin Bakkar, knocked at the door. The servants hastened to
admit him and walked before him till they had brought him to
their master, whom he found strown upon his bed. Now when he
saw the jeweller, he said to him, "Thou hast tarried long from me,
and that hath heaped care upon my care." Then he dismissed his
servants and bade the doors be shut; after which he said to the
jeweller, "By Allah, O my brother, I have not closed my eyes
since the day I saw thee last; for the slave-girl came to me yesterday
with a sealed letter from her mistress Shams al-Nahar;" and
went on to tell him all that had passed with her, adding, "By the
Lord, I am indeed perplexed concerning mine affair and my
patience faileth me: for Abu al-Hasan was a comforter who
cheered me because he knew the slave-girl." When the jeweller
heard his words, he laughed; and Ali said, "Why dost thou laugh
at my words, thou on whose coming I congratulated myself and to
whom I looked for provision against the shifts of fortune?" Then
he sighed and wept and repeated these couplets:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1443" id="noteref-1443" epub:type="noteref">1443</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Full many laugh at tears they see me shed ✿ Who had shed tears an bore they what I bore;</div>
      <div class="line">None feeleth pity for th' afflicted's woe, ✿ Save one as anxious and in woe galore:</div>
      <div class="line">My passion, yearning, sighing, thought, repine ✿ Are for me cornered in my heart's deep core:</div>
      <div class="line">He made a home there which he never quits, ✿ Yet rare our meetings, not as heretofore:</div>
      <div class="line">No friend to stablish in his place I see; ✿ No intimate but only he and——he.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when the jeweller heard these lines and understood their
significance, he wept also and told him all that had passed betwixt
himself and the slave-girl and her mistress since he left him. And
Ali bin Bakkar gave ear to his speech, and at every word he heard
his colour shifted from white to red and his body grew now stronger
and then weaker till the tale came to an end, when he wept and
said, "O my brother, I am a lost man in any case: would mine
end were nigh, that I might be at rest from all this! But I beg
thee, of thy favour, to be my helper and comforter in all my affairs
till Allah fulfil whatso be His will; and I will not gainsay thee
with a single word." Quoth the jeweller, "Nothing will quench
thy fire save union with her whom thou lovest; and the meeting
must be in other than this perilous place. Better it were in a
house of mine where the girl and her mistress met me; which
place she chose for herself, to the intent that ye twain may there
meet and complain each to other of what you have suffered from
the pangs of love." Quoth Ali bin Bakkar, "O good Sir, do as
thou wilt and with Allah be thy reward!; and what thou deemest
is right do it forthright: but be not long in doing it, lest I perish
of this anguish." So I abode with him (said the jeweller) that
night conversing with him till the morning morrowed,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the jeweller
continued:—So I abode with him that night conversing with him
till the morning morrowed, when I prayed the dawn-prayers and,
going out from him, returned to my house. Hardly had I settled
down when the damsel came up and saluted me; and I returned
her salutation and told her what had passed between myself and
Ali bin Bakkar, and she said, "Know that the Caliph hath left us
and there is no one in our place and it is safer for us and better."
Replied I, "Sooth thou sayest; yet is it not like my other house
which is both fitter and surer for us;" and the slave-girl rejoined,
"Be it as thou seest fit. I am now going to my lady and will tell
her what thou sayest and acquaint her with all thou hast mentioned."
So she went away and sought her mistress and laid the
project before her, and presently returned and said to me, "It is
to be as thou sayest: so make us ready the place and expect us."
Then she took out of her breast-pocket a purse of dinars and gave
this message, "My lady saluteth thee and saith to thee:—Take
this and provide therewith what the case requireth." But I swore
that I would accept naught of it; so she took the purse and
returning to her mistress, told her, "He would not receive the
money, but gave it back to me." "No matter," answered Shams
al-Nahar. As soon as the slave-girl was gone (continued the
jeweller), I arose and betook myself to my other house and transported
thither all that was needful, by way of vessels and furniture
and rich carpets; and I did not forget china vases and cups of
glass and gold and silver; and I made ready meat and drink
required for the occasion. When the damsel came and saw what
I had done, it pleased her and she bade me fetch Ali bin Bakkar;
but I said, "None shall bring him save thou." Accordingly she
went to him and brought him back perfectly dressed and looking
his best. I met him and greeted him and then seated him upon a
divan befitting his condition, and set before him sweet-scented
flowers in vases of china and vari-coloured glass.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1444" id="noteref-1444" epub:type="noteref">1444</a> Then I set on
a tray of many-tinted meats such as broaden the breast with their
sight, and sat talking with him and diverting him, whilst the slave-girl
went away and was absent till after sundown-prayers, when
she returned with Shams al-Nahar, attended by two maids and
none else. Now as soon as she saw Ali bin Bakkar and he saw
her, he rose and embraced her, and she on her side embraced him
and both fell in a fit to the ground. They lay for a whole hour
insensible; then, coming to themselves, they began mutually to
complain of the pains of separation. Thereupon they drew near
to each other and sat talking charmingly, softly, tenderly; after
which they somewhat perfumed themselves and fell to thanking
me for what I had done for them. Quoth I, "Have ye a mind for
food?" "Yes," quoth they. So I set before them a small matter of
food and they ate till they were satisfied and then washed their
hands; after which I led them to another sitting-room and brought
them wine. So they drank and drank deep and inclined to each
other; and presently Shams al-Nahar said to me, "O my master,
complete thy kindness by bringing us a lute or other instrument of
mirth and music that the measure of our joy may be fully filled."
I replied, "On my head and eyes!" and rising brought her a lute,
which she took and tuned; then laying it in her lap she touched
it with a masterly touch, at once exciting to sadness and changing
sorrow to gladness; after which she sang these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">

      <div class="line">My sleeplessness would show I love to bide on wake; ✿ And would my leanness prove that sickness is my make:</div>

<p>Then she went on to sing the choicest and most affecting poesy
to many and various modes, till our senses were bewitched and
the very room danced with excess of delight and surprise at her
sweet singing; and neither thought nor reason was left in us.
When we had sat awhile and the cup had gone round amongst
us, the damsel took the lute and sang to a lively measure these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My love a meeting promised me and kept it faithfully, ✿ One night as many I shall count in number and degree:</div>
      <div class="line">O Night of joyance Fate vouchsafed to faithful lovers tway, ✿ Uncaring for the railer loon and all his company!</div>
      <div class="line">My lover lay the Night with me and clipt me with his right, ✿ While I with left embraced him, a-faint for ecstasy;</div>
      <div class="line">And hugged him to my breast and sucked the sweet wine of his lips, ✿ Full savouring the honey-draught the honey-man sold to me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Whilst we were thus drowned in the sea of gladness (continued the
jeweller) behold, there came in to us a little maid trembling and
said, "O my lady, look how you may go away for the folk have
found you out and have surrounded the house; and we know not
the cause of this!" When I heard her words, I arose startled and
lo! in rushed a slave-girl who cried, "Calamity hath come upon
you." At the same moment the door was burst open and there
rushed in upon us ten men masked in kerchiefs with hangers in
their hands and swords by their sides, and as many more behind
them. When I saw this, the world was straitened on me for all its
wideness, and I looked to the door but saw no issue; so I sprang
from the terrace into the house of one of my neighbours and there
hid myself. Thence I found that folk had entered my lodgings
and were making a mighty hubbub; and I concluded that the
Caliph had got wind of us and had sent his Chief of the Watch to
seize us and bring us before him. So I abode confounded and
ceased not remaining in my place, without any possibility of
quitting it till midnight. And presently the house-master arose,
for he had heard me moving, and he feared with exceeding great
fear of me; so he came forth from his room with drawn brand in
hand and made at me, saying, "Who is this in my house?" Quoth
I, "I am thy neighbour the jeweller;" and he knew me and retired.
Then he fetched a light and coming up to me, said, "O my
brother, indeed that which hath befallen thee this night is no light
matter to me." I replied, "O my brother, tell me who was in
my house and entered it breaking in my door; for I fled to thee
not knowing what was to do." He answered, "Of a truth the
robbers who attacked our neighbours yesterday and slew such an
one and took his goods, saw thee on the same day bringing furniture
into this house; so they broke in upon thee and stole thy
goods and slew thy guests." Then we arose (pursued the jeweller),
I and he, and repaired to my house, which we found empty without
a stick remaining in it; so I was confounded at the case and said
to myself, "As for the gear I care naught about its loss, albeit I
borrowed part of the stuff from my friends and it hath come to
grief; yet there is no harm in that, for they know my excuse in
the plunder of my property and the pillage of my place. But as
for Ali bin Bakkar and the Caliph's favourite concubine, I fear lest
their case get bruited abroad and this cause the loss of my life." So
I turned to my neighbour and said to him, "Thou art my brother
and my neighbour and wilt cover my nakedness; what then dost
thou advise me to do?" The man answered, "What I counsel thee
to do is to keep quiet and wait; for they who entered thy house
and took thy goods have murdered the best men of a party from
the palace of the Caliphate and have killed not a few of the
watchmen: the government officers and guards are now in quest
of them on every road and haply they will hit upon them, whereby
thy wish will come about without effort of thine." The jeweller
hearing these words returned to his other house, that wherein he
dwelt,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
the jeweller heard these words he returned to his other house
wherein he dwelt, and said to himself, "Indeed this that hath
befallen me is what Abu al-Hasan feared and from which he
fled to Bassorah. And now I have fallen into it." Presently
the pillage of his pleasure-house was noised abroad among the
folk, and they came to him from all sides and places, some
exulting in his misfortune and others excusing him and condoling
with his sorrow; whilst he bewailed himself to them
and for grief neither ate meat nor drank drink. And as he
sat, repenting him of what he had done, behold one of his
servants came in to him and said, "There is a person at the
door who asketh for thee; and I know him not." The jeweller
went forth to him and saluted him who was a stranger; and
the man whispered to him, "I have somewhat to say between
our two selves." Thereupon he brought him in and asked him,
"What hast thou to tell me?" Quoth the man, "Come with me
to thine other house;" and the jeweller enquired, "Dost thou then
know my other house?" Replied the other, "I know all about thee
and I know that also whereby Allah will dispel thy dolours." So I
said to myself (continued the jeweller) "I will go with him whither
he will;" and went out and walked on till we came to my second
house; and when the man saw it he said to me, "It is without
door or door-keeper, and we cannot possibly sit in it; so come thou
with me to another place." Then the man continued passing from
stead to stead (and I with him) till night overtook us. Yet I put
no question to him of the matter in hand and we ceased not to
walk on, till we reached the open country. He kept saying, "Follow
me," and quickened his pace to a trot, whilst I trotted after him
heartening my heart to go on, until we reached the river, where he
took boat with me, and the boatman rowed us over to the other
bank. Then he landed from the boat and I landed after him;
and he took my hand and led me to a street which I had never
entered in all my days, nor do I know in what quarter it was.
Presently the man stopped at the door of a house, and opening it
entered and made me enter with him; after which he locked the
door with an iron padlock,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1445" id="noteref-1445" epub:type="noteref">1445</a> and led me along the vestibule, till he
brought me in the presence of ten men who were as though they
were one and the same man; they being brothers. We saluted
them (continued the jeweller) and they returned our greeting and
bade us be seated; so we sat down. Now I was like to die for
excess of weariness; but they brought me rose-water and sprinkled
it on my face; after which they gave me a sherbet to drink and set
before me food whereof some of them ate with me. Quoth I to
myself, "Were there aught harmful in the food, they would not eat
with me." So I ate, and when we had washed our hands, each of
us returned to his place. Then they asked me, "Dost thou know
us?" and I answered, "No! nor in my life have I ever seen you;
nay, I know not even him who brought me hither." Said they,
"Tell us thy tidings and lie not at all." Replied I, "Know then
that my case is wondrous and my affair marvellous; but wot ye
anything about me?" They rejoined, "Yes! it was we took thy
goods yesternight and carried off thy friend and her who was
singing to him." Quoth I, "Allah let down His veil over you!
Where be my friend and she who was singing to him?" They
pointed with their hands to one side and replied, "Yonder, but, by
Allah, O our brother, the secret of their case is known to none save
to thee, for from the time we brought the twain hither up to this
day, we have not looked upon them nor questioned them of their
condition, seeing them to be persons of rank and dignity. Now
this and this only it was that hindered our killing them: so tell
us the truth of their case and thou shalt be assured of thy safety
and of theirs." When I heard this (continued the jeweller) I
almost died of fright and horror, and I said to them, "Know ye, O
my brethren, that if generosity were lost, it would not be found
save with you; and had I a secret which I feared to reveal, none
but your breasts would conceal it." And I went on exaggerating
their praises in this fashion, till I saw that frankness and readiness
to speak out would profit me more than concealing facts; so I told
them all that had betided me to the very end of the tale. When
they heard it, they said, "And is this young man Ali Bakkar-son
and this lady Shams al-Nahar?" I replied "Yes." Now this was
grievous to them and they rose and made their excuses to the
two and then they said to me, "Of what we took from thy house
part is spent, but here is what is left of it." So speaking, they
gave me back most of my goods and they engaged to return them
to their places in my house, and to restore me the rest as soon as
they could. My heart was set at ease till they split into two parties,
one with me and the other against me; and we fared forth
from that house and such was my case. But as regards Ali bin
Bakkar and Shams al-Nahar; they were well-nigh dying for excess
of fear, when I went up to them and saluting them, asked, "What
happened to the damsel and the two maids, and where be they
gone?"; and they answered only, "We know nothing of them."
Then we walked on and stinted not till we came to the river-bank
where the barque lay; and we all boarded it, for it was the same
which had brought me over on the day before. The boatman
rowed us to the other side; but hardly had we landed and taken
seat on the bank to rest, when a troop of horse swooped down on
us like eagles and surrounded us on all sides and places, whereupon
the robbers with us sprang up in haste like vultures, and the
boat put back for them and took them in and the boatman pushed
off into mid-stream, leaving us on the river bank, unable to move
or to stand still. Then the chief horseman said to us, "Whence be
ye!"; and we were perplexed for an answer, but I said (continued
the jeweller), "Those ye saw with us are rogues; we know them
not. As for us, we are singers, and they intended taking us to
sing for them, nor could we get free of them, save by subtlety and
soft words; so on this occasion they let us go, their works being
such as you have seen." But they looked at Shams al-Nahar and
Ali bin Bakkar and said to me, "Thou hast not spoken sooth but,
if thy tale be true, tell us who ye are and whence ye are; and what
be your place and in what quarter you dwell." I knew not what
to answer them, but Shams al-Nahar sprang up and approaching
the Captain of the horsemen spoke with him privily, whereupon
he dismounted from his steed and, setting her on horseback,
took the bridle and began to lead his beast. And two of his men
did the like with the youth, Ali bin Bakkar, and it was the same
with myself. The Commandant of the troop ceased not faring on
with us, till they reached a certain part of the river bank, when he
sang out in some barbarous jargon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1446" id="noteref-1446" epub:type="noteref">1446</a> and there came to us a
number of men with two boats. Then the Captain embarked us
in one of them (and he with us) whilst the rest of his men put off
in the other, and rowed on with us till we arrived at the palace of
the Caliphate where Shams al-Nahar landed. And all the while
we endured the agonies of death for excess of fear, and they ceased
not faring till they came to a place whence there was a way to our
quarter. Here we landed and walked on, escorted by some of the
horsemen, till we came to Ali bin Bakkar's house; and when we
entered it, our escort took leave of us and went their way. We
abode there, unable to stir from the place and not knowing the
difference between morning and evening; and in such case we
continued till the dawn of the next day. And when it was again
nightfall, I came to myself and saw Ali bin Bakkar and the women
and men of his household weeping over him, for he was stretched
out without sense or motion. Some of them came to me and
thoroughly arousing me said, "Tell us what hath befallen our son
and say how came he in this plight?" Replied I, "O folk,
hearken to me"——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the jeweller
answered them, "O folk, hearken to my words and give me no
trouble and annoyance! but be patient and he will come to and
tell you his tale for himself." And I was hard upon them and
made them afraid of a scandal between me and them, but as we
were thus, behold, Ali bin Bakkar moved on his carpet-bed; whereat
his friends rejoiced and the stranger folk withdrew from him; but
his people forbade me to go away. Then they sprinkled rose-water
on his face and he presently revived and sensed the air; whereupon
they questioned him of his case, and he essayed to answer them
but his tongue could not speak forthright and he signed to them
to let me go home. So they let me go, and I went forth hardly
crediting my escape and returned to my own house, supported by
two men. When my people saw me thus, they rose up and set to
shrieking and slapping their faces; but I signed to them with my
hand to be silent and they were silent. Then the two men went
their way and I threw myself down on my bed, where I lay the rest
of the night and awoke not till the forenoon, when I found my
people gathered round me and saying, "What calamity befel thee,
and what evil with its mischief did fell thee?" Quoth I, "Bring
me somewhat to drink." So they brought me drink, and I drank of
it what I would and said to them, "What happened, happened."
Thereupon they went away and I made my excuses to my friends,
and asked if any of the goods that had been stolen from my other
house had been returned. They answered, "Yes! some of them
have come back; by token that a man entered and threw them
down within the doorway and we saw him not." So I comforted
myself and abode in my place two days, unable to rise and leave
it; and presently I took courage and went to the bath, for I was
worn out with fatigue and troubled in mind for Ali bin Bakkar
and Shams al-Nahar, because I had no news of them all this time
and could neither get to Ali's house nor, out of fear for my life,
take my rest in mine own. And I repented to Almighty Allah of
what I had done and praised Him for my safety. Presently my
fancy suggested to me to go to such and such a place and see the
folk and solace myself; so I went on foot to the cloth-market and
sat awhile with a friend of mine there. When I rose to go, I saw
a woman standing over against me; so I looked at her, and lo! it
was Shams al-Nahar's slave-girl. When I saw her, the world grew
dark in my eyes and I hurried on. She followed me, but I was
seized with affright and fled from her, and whenever I looked at
her, a trembling came upon me whilst she pursued me, saying,
"Stop, that I may tell thee somewhat!" But I heeded her not
and never ceased walking till I reached a mosque, and she entered
after me. I prayed a two-bow prayer, after which I turned to her
and, sighing, said, "What dost thou want?" She asked me how
I did, and I told her all that had befallen myself and Ali bin
Bakkar and besought her for news of herself. She answered,
"Know that when I saw the robbers break open thy door and
rush in, I was in sore terror, for I doubted not but that they
were the Caliph's officers and would seize me and my mistress and
we should perish forthwith: so we fled over the roofs, I and the
maids; and, casting ourselves down from a high place, came upon
some people with whom we took refuge; and they received us and
brought us to the palace of the Caliphate, where we arrived in the
sorriest of plights. We concealed our case and abode on coals of
fire till nightfall, when I opened the river-gate and, calling the
boatman who had carried us the night before, said to him:—I
know not what is become of my mistress; so take me in the boat,
that we may go seek her on the river: haply I shall chance on
some news of her. Accordingly he took me into the boat and went
about with me and ceased not wending till midnight, when I spied
a <span xml:lang="fr">barque</span> making towards the water gate, with one man rowing and
another standing up and a woman lying prostrate between them
twain. And they rowed on till they reached the shore when the
woman landed, and I looked at her, and behold, it was Shams
al-Nahar. Thereupon I got out and joined her, dazed for joy to
see her after having lost all hopes of finding her alive."——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the slave-girl
went on telling the jeweller, "I was dazed for joy to see her,
after having lost all hopes of finding her alive. When I came up
to her, she bade me give the man who had brought her thither
a thousand gold pieces; and we carried her in, I and the two
maids, and laid her on her bed; where she passed that night
in a sorely troubled state; and, when morning dawned, I forbade
the women and eunuchs to go in to her, or even to draw near her
for the whole of that day; but on the next she revived and somewhat
recovered and I found her as if she had come out of her
grave. I sprinkled rose-water upon her face and changed her
clothes and washed her hands and feet; nor did I cease to coax
her, till I brought her to eat a little and drink some wine, though
she had no mind to any such matter. As soon as she had
breathed the fresh air and strength began to return to her, I took
to upbraiding her, saying:—O my lady, consider and have pity on
thyself; thou seest what hath betided us: surely, enough and more
than enough of evil hath befallen thee; for indeed thou hast been
nigh upon death. She said:—By Allah, O good damsel, in sooth
death were easier to me than what hath betided me; for it seemed
as though I should be slain and no power could save me. When
the robbers took us from the jeweller's house they asked me,
Who mayst thou be? and hearing my answer:—I am a singing
girl, they believed me. Then they turned to Ali bin Bakkar and
made enquiries about him:—And who art thou and what is thy
condition?; whereto he replied:—I am of the common kind.
So they took us and carried us along, without our resisting, to
their abode; and we hurried on with them for excess of fear;
but when they had us set down with them in the house, they
looked hard at me and seeing the clothes I wore and my necklaces
and jewellery, believed not my account of myself and said
to me:—Of a truth these necklaces belong to no singing-girl;
so be soothfast and tell us the truth of thy case. I returned
them no answer whatever, saying in my mind:—Now will they
slay me for the sake of my apparel and ornaments; and I spoke
not a word. Then the villains turned to Ali bin Bakkar, asking:—And
thou, who art thou and whence art thou? for thy semblance
seemeth not as that of the common kind. But he was silent and
we ceased not to keep our counsel and to weep, till Allah softened
the rogues' hearts to pity and they said to us:—Who is the owner
of the house wherein ye were? We answered:—Such an one,
the jeweller; whereupon quoth one of them:—I know him right
well and I wot the other house where he liveth and I will engage
to bring him to you this very hour. Then they agreed to set
me in a place by myself and Ali bin Bakkar in a place by
himself, and said to us:—Be at rest ye twain and fear not lest
your secret be divulged; ye are safe from us. Meanwhile their
comrade went away and returned with the jeweller, who made
known to them our case, and we joined company with him; after
which a man of the band fetched a <span xml:lang="fr">barque</span>, wherein they embarked
us all three and, rowing us over the river, landed us with scant
ceremony on the opposite bank and went their ways. Thereupon
up came a horse-patrol and asked us who we were; so
I spoke with the Captain of the watch and said to him:—I am
Shams al-Nahar, the Caliph's favourite; I had drunken strong
wine and went out to visit certain of my acquaintance of the
wives of the Wazirs, when yonder rogues came upon me and
laid hold of me and brought me to this place; but when they
saw you, they fled as fast as they could. I met these men with
them; so do thou escort me and them to a place of safety and
I will requite thee as I am well able to do. When the Captain
of the watch heard my speech, he knew me and alighting,
mounted me on his horse; and in like manner did two of his
men with Ali bin Bakkar. So I spoke to her (continued the
handmaid) and blamed her doings, and bade her beware, and
said to her:—O my lady, have some care for thy life! But she
was angered at my words and cried out at me; accordingly I
left her and came forth in quest of thee, but found thee not and
dared not go to the house of Ali bin Bakkar; so stood watching
for thee, that I might ask thee of him and wot how it goes
with him. And I pray thee, of thy favour, to take of me some
money, for thou hast doubtless borrowed from thy friends part
of the gear and as it is lost, it behoveth thee to make it good
with folk." I replied, "To hear is to obey! go on;" and I walked
with her till we drew near my house, when she said to me,
"Wait here till I come back to thee."——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the
slave-girl had addressed the jeweller, "Wait here till I come
back to thee!" she went away and presently returned with the
money, which she put (continued the jeweller) into my hand,
saying, "O my master, in what place shall we meet?" Quoth I,
"I will start and go to my house at once and suffer hard things
for thy sake and contrive how thou mayst win access to him, for
such access is difficult at this present." Said she, "Let me know
some spot, where I shall come to thee," and I answered, "In my
other house; I will go thither forthright and have the doors
mended and the place made safe again, and henceforth we will
meet there." Then she took leave of me and went her way, whilst
I carried the money home, and counting it, found it five thousand
dinars. So I gave my people some of it and to all who had lent
me aught I made good their loss, after which I arose and took my
servants and repaired to my other house whence the things had
been stolen; and I brought builders and carpenters and masons
who restored it to its former state. Moreover, I placed my
negress-slave there and forgot the mishaps which had befallen
me. Then I fared forth and repaired to Ali bin Bakkar's house
and, when I reached it, his slave-servants accosted me, saying,
"Our lord calleth for thee night and day, and hath promised to
free whichever of us bringeth thee to him; so they have been
wandering about in quest of thee everywhere but knew not in what
part to find thee. Our master is by way of recovering strength, but
at times he reviveth and at times he relapseth; and whenever he
reviveth he nameth thee, and saith:—Needs must ye bring him to
me, though but for the twinkling of an eye; and then he sinketh
back into his torpor." Accordingly (continued the jeweller) I
accompanied the slave and went in to Ali bin Bakkar; and, finding
him unable to speak, sat down at his head, whereupon he
opened his eyes and seeing me, wept and said, "Welcome and
well come!" I raised him and making him sit up, strained him
to my bosom, and he said, "Know, O my brother, that, from the
hour I took to my bed, I have not sat up till now: praise to Allah
that I see thee again!" And I ceased not to prop him and support
him until I made him stand on his feet and walk a few steps, after
which I changed his clothes and he drank some wine: but all this
he did for my satisfaction. Then, seeing him somewhat restored,
I told him what had befallen me with the slave-girl (none else
hearing me), and said to him, "Take heart and be of good courage,
I know what thou sufferest." He smiled and I added, "Verily
nothing shall betide thee save what shall rejoice thee and medicine
thee." Thereupon he called for food, which being brought, he
signed to his pages, and they withdrew. Then quoth he to me,
"O my brother, hast thou seen what hath befallen me?"; and he
made excuses to me and asked how I had fared all that while.
I told him everything that had befallen me, from beginning to
end, whereat he wondered and calling his servants, said, "Bring
me such and such things." They brought in fine carpets and
hangings and, besides that, vessels of gold and silver, more than
I had lost, and he gave them all to me; so I sent them to my
house and abode with him that night. When the day began to
yellow, he said to me, "Know thou that as to all things there is an
end, so the end of love is either death or accomplishment of desire.
I am nearer unto death, would I had died ere this befel!; and had
not Allah favoured us, we had been found out and put to shame.
And now I know not what shall deliver me from this my strait,
and were it not that I fear Allah, I would hasten my own death;
for know, O my brother, that I am like bird in cage and that my
life is of a surety perished, choked by the distresses which have
befallen me; yet hath it a period stablished firm and an appointed
term." And he wept and groaned and began repeating:—</p>

  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Enough of tears hath shed the lover-wight, ✿ When grief outcast all patience from his sprite:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he had finished his verses, the jeweller said to him, "O my
lord, I now intend returning to my house." He answered, "There
be no harm in that; go and come back to me with news as fast as
possible, for thou seest my case." So I took leave of him (continued
the jeweller) and went home, and hardly had I sat down,
when up came the damsel, choked with long weeping. I asked,
"What is the matter?"; and she answered, "O my lord, know
then that what we feared hath befallen us; for, when I left thee
yesterday and returned to my lady, I found her in a fury with one
of the two maids who were with us the other night, and she ordered
her to be beaten. The girl was frightened and ran away; but, as
she was leaving the house, one of the door-porters and guards of
the gate met her and took her up and would have sent her back
to her mistress. However, she let fall some hints, which were a
disclosure to him; so he cajoled her and led her on to talk, and
she tattled about our case and let him know of all our doings.
This affair came to the ears of the Caliph, who bade remove my
mistress, Shams al-Nahar, and all her gear to the palace of the
Caliphate; and set over her a guard of twenty eunuchs. Since
then to the present hour he hath not visited her nor hath given
her to know the reason of his action, but I suspect this to be the
cause; wherefore I am in fear for my life and am sore troubled, O
my lord, knowing not what I shall do, nor with what contrivance
I shall order my affair and hers; for she hath none by her more
trusted or more trustworthy than myself."——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the slave-girl
thus addressed the jeweller, "And in very sooth my lady hath
none by her more trusted or more trustworthy in matter of secrecy
than myself. So go thou, O my master, and speed thee without
delay to Ali bin Bakkar; and acquaint him with this, that he may
be on his guard and ward; and, if the affair be discovered, we will
cast about for some means whereby to save our lives." On this
(continued the jeweller), I was seized with sore trouble and the
world grew dark in my sight for the slave-girl's words; and when
she was about to wend, I said to her, "What reckest thou and what
is to be done?" Quoth she, "My counsel is that thou hasten to
Ali bin Bakkar, if thou be indeed his friend and desire to save
him; thine be it to carry him this news at once without aught of
stay and delay, or regard for far and near; and mine be it to sniff
about for further news." Then she took her leave of me and went
away: so I rose and followed her track and, betaking myself to
Ali bin Bakkar, found him flattering himself with impossible expectations.
When he saw me returning to him so soon, he said,
"I see thou hast come back to me forthwith and only too soon."
I answered, "Patience, and cut short this foolish connection and
shake off the pre-occupation wherein thou art, for there hath befallen
that which may bring about the loss of thy life and good."
Now when he heard this, he was troubled and strongly moved; and
he said to me, "O my brother, tell me what hath happened."
Replied I, "O my lord, know that such and such things have
happened and thou art lost without recourse, if thou abide in this
thy house till the end of the day." At this, he was confounded
and his soul well-nigh departed his body, but he recovered himself
and said to me, "What shall I do, O my brother, and what counsel
hast thou to offer?" Answered I, "My advice is that thou take
what thou canst of thy property and whom of thy slaves thou
trustest, and flee with us to a land other than this, ere this very day
come to an end." And he said, "I hear and I obey." So he rose,
confused and dazed like one in epilepsy, now walking and now
falling, and took what came under his hand. Then he made an
excuse to his household and gave them his last injunctions, after
which he loaded three camels and mounted his beast; and I did
likewise. We went forth privily in disguise and fared on and ceased
not our wayfare the rest of that day and all its night, till nigh upon
morning, when we unloaded and, hobbling our camels, lay down to
sleep. But we were worn with fatigue and we neglected to keep
watch, so that there fell upon us robbers, who stripped us of all we
had and slew our slaves, when these would have beaten them off,
leaving us naked and in the sorriest of plights, after they had taken
our money and lifted our beasts and disappeared. As soon as they
were gone, we arose and walked on till morning dawned, when we
came to a village which we entered, and finding a mosque took
refuge therein for we were naked. So we sat in a corner all that
day and we passed the next night without meat or drink; and
at daybreak we prayed our dawn-prayer and sat down again.
Presently behold, a man entered and saluting us prayed a two-bow
prayer, after which he turned to us and said, "O folk, are
ye strangers?" We replied, "Yes: the bandits waylaid us and
stripped us naked, and we came to this town but know none here
with whom we may shelter." Quoth he, "What say ye? will you
come home with me?" And (pursued the jeweller) I said to Ali
bin Bakkar, "Up and let us go with him, and we shall escape two
evils; the first, our fear lest some one who knoweth us enter this
mosque and recognise us, so that we come to disgrace; and the
second, that we are strangers and have no place wherein to
lodge." And he answered helplessly, "As thou wilt." Then
the man said to us again, "O ye poor folk, give ear unto me
and come with me to my place," and I replied, "Hearkening and
obedience;" whereupon he pulled off a part of his own clothes and
covered us therewith and made his excuses to us and spoke kindly
to us. Then we arose and accompanied him to his house and he
knocked at the door, whereupon a little slave-boy came out and
opened to us. The host entered and we followed him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1447" id="noteref-1447" epub:type="noteref">1447</a> when he
called for a bundle of clothes and muslins for turbands, and gave
us each a suit and a piece; so we dressed and turbanded ourselves
and sat us down. Presently, in came a damsel with a tray of
food and set it before us, saying, "Eat." We ate some small
matter and she took away the tray: after which we abode with our
host till nightfall, when Ali bin Bakkar sighed and said to me,
"Know, O my brother, that I am a dying man past hope of life
and I would charge thee with a charge: it is that, when thou seest
me dead, thou go to my parent<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1448" id="noteref-1448" epub:type="noteref">1448</a> and tell her of my decease and bid
her come hither that she may be here to receive the visits of condolence
and be present at the washing of my corpse; and do thou
exhort her to bear my loss with patience." Then he fell down in
a fainting fit and, when he recovered he heard a damsel singing
afar off and making verses as she sang. Thereupon he addressed
himself to give ear to her and hearken to her voice; and now he
was insensible, absent from the world, and now he came to himself;
and anon he wept for grief and mourning at the love which had
befallen him. Presently, he heard the damsel who was singing
repeat these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Parting ran up to part from lover-twain ✿ Free converse, perfect concord, friendship fain:</div>
      <div class="line">The Nights with shifting drifted us apart, ✿ Would heaven I wot if we shall meet again:</div>
      <div class="line">How bitter after meeting 'tis to part, ✿ May lovers ne'er endure so bitter pain!</div>
      <div class="line">Death-grip, death-choke, lasts for an hour and ends, ✿ But parting-tortures aye in heart remain:</div>
      <div class="line">Could we but trace where Parting's house is placed, ✿ We would make Parting eke of parting taste!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Ali son of Bakkar heard the damsel's song, he sobbed one
sob and his soul quitted his body. As soon as I saw that he was
dead (continued the jeweller), I committed his corpse to the care
of the house-master and said to him "Know thou, that I am going
to Baghdad, to tell his mother and kinsfolk, that they may come
hither and conduct his burial." So I betook myself to Baghdad
and, going to my house, changed my clothes; after which I
repaired to Ali bin Bakkar's lodging. Now when his servants
saw me, they came to me and questioned me of him, and I bade
them ask permission for me to go in to his mother. She gave
me leave; so I entered and saluting her, said, "Verily Allah
ordereth the lives of all creatures by His commandment and
when He decreeth aught, there is no escaping its fulfilment; nor
can any soul depart but by leave of Allah, according to the Writ
which affirmeth the appointed term."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1449" id="noteref-1449" epub:type="noteref">1449</a> She guessed by these
words that her son was dead and wept with sore weeping, then
she said to me, "Allah upon thee! tell me, is my son dead?" I
could not answer her for tears and excess of grief, and when she
saw me thus, she was choked with weeping and fell to the ground
in a fit. As soon as she came to herself she said to me, "Tell me
how it was with my son." I replied, "May Allah abundantly
compensate thee for his loss!" and I told her all that had befallen
him from beginning to end. She then asked, "Did he give thee
any charge?"; and I answered, "Yes," and told her what he had
said, adding, "Hasten to perform his funeral." When she heard
these words, she swooned away again; and, when she recovered,
she addressed herself to do as I charged her. Then I returned to
my house; and as I went along musing sadly upon the fair gifts
of his youth, behold, a woman caught hold of my hand;——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Sixty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
jeweller thus continued:—A woman caught hold of my hand; and
I looked at her and lo! it was the slave-girl who used to come
from Shams al-Nahar, and she seemed broken by grief. When we
knew each other we both wept and ceased not weeping till we
reached my house, and I said to her, "Knowest thou the news of
the youth, Ali bin Bakkar?" She replied, "No, by Allah!"; so
I told her the manner of his death and all that had passed, whilst
we both wept; after which quoth I to her, "How is it with thy
mistress?" Quoth she, "The Commander of the Faithful would
not hear a single word against her; but, for the great love he bore
her, saw all her actions in a favourable light, and said to her:—O
Shams al-Nahar, thou art dear to me and I will bear with thee
and bring the noses of thy foes to the grindstone. Then he bade
them furnish her an apartment decorated with gold and a handsome
sleeping-chamber, and she abode with him in all ease of life
and high favour. Now it came to pass that one day, as he sat at
wine according to his custom, with his favourite concubines in
presence, he bade them be seated in their several ranks and made
Shams al-Nahar sit by his side. But her patience had failed and
her disorder had redoubled upon her. Then he bade one of the
damsels sing: so she took a lute and tuning it struck the chords,
and began to sing these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">One craved my love and I gave all he craved of me, ✿ And tears on cheek betray how 'twas I came to yield:</div>
      <div class="line">Tear-drops, meseemeth, are familiar with our case, ✿ Revealing what I hide, hiding what I revealed:</div>
      <div class="line">How can I hope in secret to conceal my love, ✿ Which stress of passion ever showeth unconcealed:</div>
      <div class="line">Death, since I lost my lover, is grown sweet to me; ✿ Would I knew what their joys when I shall quit the field!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Shams al-Nahar heard these verses sung by the slave-girl,
she could not keep her seat; but fell down in a fainting-fit
whereupon the Caliph cast the cup from his hand and drew her to
him crying out; and the damsels also cried out, and the Prince of
True Believers turned her over and shook her, and lo and behold!
she was dead. The Caliph grieved over her death with sore grief
and bade break all the vessels and dulcimers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1450" id="noteref-1450" epub:type="noteref">1450</a> and other instruments
of mirth and music which were in the room; then carrying
her body to his closet, he abode with her the rest of the night.
When the day broke, he laid her out and commanded to wash her
and shroud her and bury her. And he mourned for her with
sore mourning, and questioned not of her case nor of what
caused her condition. And I beg thee in Allah's name (continued
the damsel) to let me know the day of the coming of
Ali bin Bakkar's funeral procession that I may be present at
his burial." Quoth I, "For myself, where thou wilt thou canst
find me; but thou, where art thou to be found, and who can
come at thee where thou art?" She replied, "On the day of
Shams al-Nahar's death, the Commander of the Faithful freed
all her women, myself among the rest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1451" id="noteref-1451" epub:type="noteref">1451</a> and I am one of those
now abiding at the tomb in such a place." So I rose and accompanied
her to the burial-ground and piously visited Shams
al-Nahar's tomb; after which I went my way and ceased not
to await the coming of Ali bin Bakkar's funeral. When it
arrived, the people of Baghdad went forth to meet it and I
went forth with them; and I saw the damsel among the women
and she the loudest of them in lamentation, crying out and
wailing with a voice that rent the vitals and made the heart
ache. Never was seen in Baghdad a finer funeral than his;
and we ceased not to follow in crowds till we reached the
cemetery and buried him to the mercy of Almighty Allah; nor
from that time to this have I ceased to visit the tombs of Ali
son of Bakkar and of Shams al-Nahar. This, then, is their
story, and Allah Almighty have mercy upon them!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1452" id="noteref-1452" epub:type="noteref">1452</a> And yet
is not their tale (continued Shahrazad) more wonderful than
that of King Shahrimán. The King asked her "And what was
his tale?"——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>
