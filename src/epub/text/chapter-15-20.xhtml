			<h2 epub:type="title">The Kazi Schooled by His Wife</h2>

<p>It is related of a man which was a Kazi that he had a wife of the
virtuous and the righteous and of the charitable and the pitiful to
the orphan and the pauper; and the same was beautiful exceedingly.
Her husband held and was certified anent womankind that all and
every were like unto his spouse; so that when any male masculant
came into his court<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7590" id="noteref-7590" epub:type="noteref">7590</a> complaining about his rib he would deliver
his decision that the man was a wrongdoer and that the woman
was wronged. On such wise he did because he saw that his wife
was the pink of perfection and he opined that the whole of her sex
resembled her, and he knew naught of the wickedness and debauchery
of the genus and their sorcery and their contrariety and the
cunning contrivance wherewith they work upon men’s wits. He
abode all careless of such matters, in consequence of the virtues of
his spouse, until one chance day of the days when suddenly a man
came to him with a grievance about his better half and showed
how he had been evil entreated by her and how her misconduct
was manifest and public. But when the man laid his case before
the Kazi and enlarged upon his charge, the Judge determined that
he was in tort and that his wife was in the right; so the complainant
went forth the court as one deaf and blind who could
neither hear nor see. Moreover he was perplexed as to his affair,
unknowing what he should do in the matter of his helpmate and
wherefore the Kazi had determined contrary to justice that he had
ill-used his spouse. Now as to the Kazi’s wife none could forgather
with her;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7591" id="noteref-7591" epub:type="noteref">7591</a> so the plaintiff was distraught and confounded
when he was met unexpectedly on the way by one who asked him,
“What may be thy case, O certain person, and how hath it befallen
thee with the Kazi in the matter of thy rib?” “He hath given
sentence,” quoth the man, “that I am the wrong-doer and that
she is the wronged, and I know not how I shall act.” Whereupon
quoth the other, “Return and take thy station hard by the entrance
to the Judge’s Harem and place thyself under the protection of its
inmates.” The man did as his friend advised him and knocked,
when a handmaiden came out and he said to her, “O Damsel, ’tis
my desire that thou send me hither thy lady, so I may bespeak her
with a single word.” She went in and informed her mistress<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7592" id="noteref-7592" epub:type="noteref">7592</a> who
rose and humoured him, and standing veiled behind the door
asked, “What is to do with thee, O man?” “O my lady,” said
he, “I place myself under thy ward and thine honour, so thou
enable me to get justice of my wife and overcome her and prevail
over her, for in very deed she hath wronged me and disgraced me.
I came to complain of her ill-conduct before His Honour our lord
the Kazi, yet he hath determined that I am the wrong-doer and
have injured her while she is the wronged. I know not what I
shall do with him, and sundry of the folk have informed me that
thou art of the beneficent; so I require that thou charge for me
the Judge to deliver according to Holy Law his decree between
me and my mate.” Quoth she, “Go thou and take thy rest, nor
do thou return to him until he shall have sent after thee, and fear
not aught from him at all.” “Allah increase thy weal, O my
lady,” quoth he, and he left her and went about his business pondering
his case and saying to himself in mind, “Oh would Heaven
I wot whether the Kazi’s wife will protect me and deliver me from
this fornicatress, this adulteress, who hath outraged me and carried
away my good and driven me forth from her.” Now when it was
night-tide and the Judge was at leisure from his commandments,
he went into his Harem, and it was his wife’s custom whenever he
returned home to meet him at the middle doorway. But as on
that occasion she failed so to do, he walked into the apartment
wherein she woned and found her at prayers; then he recalled to
mind the contention of the man who had come to him with a
grievance against his spouse——And Shahrazad was surprised by
the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
tale, O sister mine and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate on the
coming night an the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when
it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the
Kazi went in to his wife whom he found praying, he recalled to
mind the matter of the man who had come to him with a contention
against his spouse and he said in his thought, “Verily nor
hurting nor harming ever cometh from womankind and indeed
this liar complaineth of his wife falsely;” for it was still in his
mind that all of the contrary sex are as virtuous as his lady. But
when she had done with her devotions, she rose up to him and
served him and set before him, she and her handmaidens, the tray
of food and she sat down at meat with him as was her wont. Now
amongst the dishes was a charger containing two chickens, so said
she to her husband, “By Allah, O my lord, do thou buy for us
to-morrow a couple of geese that I may let stuff them, for my
heart is set upon eating of their meat.” Said he, “O my lady,
to-morrow (Inshallah! an it be the will of the Almighty) I will
send to the Bazar and let buy for thee two geese of the biggest
and the fattest and the Eunuchs shall slaughter them and thou
shalt use them as thou will.” Accordingly, at dawn-tide the
Judge sent to buy two plump birds and bade the Eunuchs cut
their throats and the handmaidens gutted them and stuffed them
and cooked them with rice over and above the usual food. Thereupon
the Kazi’s wife arose and proceeded to work her contrivance.
She had bought two sparrows which the hunter had trapped; and
she bade kill and dress them and place them upon the rice instead
of the geese and awaited the even-tide when her husband would
return to supper. Then they spread the tables whereupon was
placed a covered platter under which he supposed stood the geese;
so he took it off and behold, he found the two sparrows. Hereat
he was perplext and said to his wife, “Allaho Akbar—God is
most Great—where be the geese?” and said she to him, “Whatso
thou broughtest here it be<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7593" id="noteref-7593" epub:type="noteref">7593</a> before thee upon the dish.” “These
be two sparrows,” quoth he, and quoth she, “I wot not.” So the
Judge arose displeased<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7594" id="noteref-7594" epub:type="noteref">7594</a> with his wife and going to her home
fetched her father and as she saw him coming, she stood up and
whipping off the two small birds placed the big ones in their
stead; and he uncovered the plate and found the geese. So he
said to his son-in-law, “Thou declarest that these be sparrows
but indeed they are geese;” for he also was deceived and went
forth in displeasure with the Judge, after which the Kazi followed
in his footstep and soothed him and invited him to meat but he
would not return with him. Hereupon the husband padlocked
the door but, before he had entered, the wife had substituted the
birdies for the big birds and when her mate sat down to meat and
would fain have eaten he uncovered the platter and beheld the
two sparrows. Seeing this he was like to go out of his mind and he
cried aloud, “Walláhi! indeed this be a portentous calamity,” and
he went forth, trotting in his haste, until he met his father-in-law
upon the way. Then he cried upon him and said, “Come and
look at the two geese which were in the platter.” “Wherefore?”
asked the other and answered he, “Because I found them changed
to two sparrows.” Hereupon the father returned with him to the
house and walked up to the table whence the lady, during her
husband’s absence, had removed the birdies and replaced the birds
in lieu of them. So the father took off the cover and finding
before him the pair of geese said to his son-in-law, “Be these
two geese? consider them well whether they be sparrows or not.”
“Two geese,” said the other and said the sire, “Then why dost
thou come to me a second and a several time and bring me hither
and complain of my daughter?” Hereupon he left him and went
forth an-angered and the Judge came up with him at the doorway
and soothed him and conjured him to return. Meanwhile the
lady arose and whipping off the geese set the two birdies in lieu
thereof and covered them up; and as soon as the Kazi returned
and sat down to meat he removed the cover from the platter and
found the two sparrows. Hereat he shrieked aloud and arose and
went forth the door and cried, “Ho Moslems, come ye to my
help!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7595" id="noteref-7595" epub:type="noteref">7595</a> Now when the people of the quarter heard the outcry,
they gathered together about the house, when the lady seized the
occasion to carry off the two birdies and to set in lieu of them the
two geese. Asked they, “What is to do with thee, O our lord the
Kazi, and what hath befallen thee?” and he answered, “I bought
two geese for our supper and now I find them turned into two
sparrows;” and so saying he led the Notables of the quarter into
his house and showed them the dish. They uncovered it and
found therein two geese, so they exclaimed, “These be two geese
which thou callest sparrows;” and so saying they left him and
went their ways. He followed them making excuses and was
absent for a while, when his wife took the birds and set the
birdies in place of them and when the Kazi returned and proceeded
to sit down at meat he uncovered the platter and behold,
thereon stood the two sparrows. So he smote hand upon hand
crying, “These be two sparrows without doubt or hesitation;”
whereat his wife arose and called out with a loud voice, “O ye
Moslems, help ye a Moslemah.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7596" id="noteref-7596" epub:type="noteref">7596</a> So the folk ran to her aidance
and asked her saying, “What is to do, O our lady?” and she
answered, “Verily my calamity is grievous and there is no Majesty
and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great. My
husband the Kazi hath gone Jinn-mad and do you of your grace
and benevolence lay hold of him and carry him to the Máristán.”——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Judge’s
wife cried upon the folk of the quarter, “Do ye of your grace and
benevolence to us seize the Kazi and carry him to the Maristan
that they may confine him therein until he return to his reason
and regain his right mind.” Hereupon they laid hands upon him
and bore him to the Bedlam and imprisoned him therein amongst
the maniacs, and it was certified to all the folk that their Kazi had
been suddenly struck by insanity and that they had confined him
in the madhouse. Now all this was of the cunning contrivance of
his wife, that she might make manifest to him concerning womankind
how none of mankind can prevail over them. But after the
lapse of three days which the Judge passed in the Bedlam, his
wife went in to him bringing a somewhat of food and set meat
before him and asked him saying, “What was it thou foundest on
the platter?” Answered he, “Two sparrows,” and continued she,
“Recover thy senses and thy right mind and see here am I who
have made thee out mad for thy confusion between two geese and
two sparrows. Now whenever any man cometh to thee complaining
of his wife (and thou unknowing aught of the couple and of their
circumstances), thou determinest that the male is the evil-doer
and withal thou wottest not that women are often the worst of
wrongers and that men are sorely wronged by them. And in the
matter now in hand, the whole of the folk declare that the Kazi is
a wrong-doer to his wife, and no one knoweth that thou art really
the wronged and I the wronger.” Indeed sooth did he say who
said, “Alas for those who be gaoled wrongfully!” So do thou
never decide aught thou knowest not. However, thou hast approved
to thyself that I am true and loyal to thee and thou makest all
the folk like one to other, but this is a sore injury to some. In the
present case do thou send for the man who is wronged and let
bring him to thy presence and bid his wife be also present and do
him justice of her.” After this she removed her husband from the
Maristan and went her ways, and the Kazi did with the man as
his lady had charged him do and whenever a plaintiff came before
him with a grievance against his wife he would decide that the
man was the wronged and the woman was the wronger, and he
ceased not doing after this fashion for a while of time. And now
(quoth Shahrazad) I will relate to you another history of
womankind and this is the tale of</p>
