			<h2 epub:type="title">Abu Hassan Al-Ziyadi and the Khorasan Man</h2>

<p>Quoth Abú Hassán al-Ziyádi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2050" id="noteref-2050" epub:type="noteref">2050</a>:—I was once in straitened case
and so needy that the grocer, the baker and other tradesmen dunned
and importuned me; and my misery became extreme, for I knew
of no resource nor what to do. Things being on this wise there
came to me one day certain of my servants and said to me, “At
the door is a pilgrim wight, who seeketh admission to thee.”
Quoth I, “Admit him.” So he came in and behold, he was a
Khorasání. We exchanged salutations and he said to me, “Tell
me, art thou Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?”; and I replied, “Yes, what is
thy wish?” Quoth he, “I am a stranger and am minded to make
the pilgrimage; but I have with me a great sum of money, which
is burdensome to bear: so I wish to deposit these ten thousand
dirhams with thee whilst I make my pilgrimage and return. If
the caravan march back and thou see me not, then know that I
am dead, in which case the money is a gift from me to thee; but
if I come back, it shall be mine.” I answered, “Be it as thou
wilt, an thus please Allah Almighty.” So he brought out a
leather bag and I said to the servant, “Fetch the scales;” and
when he brought them the man weighed out the money and
handed it to me, after which he went his way. Then I called
the purveyors and paid them my liabilities——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Three Hundred and Fiftieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Abu
Hassan al-Ziyadi:—I called the purveyors and paid them my
liabilities and spent freely and amply, saying to myself, “By the
time he returns, Allah will have relieved me with one or other of
the bounties He hath by Him.” However, on the very next day.
the servant came in to me and said, “Thy friend the Khorasan
man is at the door.” “Admit him,” answered I. So he came in
and said to me, “I had purposed to make the pilgrimage; but
news hath reached me of the decease of my father, and I have
resolved to return; so give me the monies I deposited with thee
yesterday.” When I heard this, I was troubled and perplexed
beyond measure of perplexity known to man and wotted not what
reply to make him; for, if I denied it, he would put me on my
oath, and I should be disgraced in the world to come; whilst, if I
told him that I had spent the money, he would make an outcry
and dishonour me before men. So I said to him, “Allah give thee
health! This my house is no stronghold nor site of safe custody
for this money. When I received thy leather bag, I sent it to one
with whom it now is; so do thou return to us to-morrow and take
thy money, Inshallah!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2051" id="noteref-2051" epub:type="noteref">2051</a> So he went away and I passed the
night in great concern, because of his return to me; sleep visited
me not nor could I close my eyes; so I rose and bade the boy
saddle me the she-mule. Answered he, “O my lord, it is yet but
the first third of the night and indeed we have hardly had time to
rest.” I returned to my bed, but sleep was forbidden to me and I
ceased not to awaken the boy, and he to put me off, till break of
day, when he saddled me the mule, and I mounted and rode out,
not knowing whither to go. I threw the reins on the mule’s
shoulders and gave myself up to regrets and melancholy thoughts,
whilst she fared on with me to the eastward of Baghdad. Presently,
as I went along, behold, I saw a number of people approaching
me and turned aside into another path to avoid them;
but seeing that I wore a turband in preacher-fashion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2052" id="noteref-2052" epub:type="noteref">2052</a> they followed
me and hastening up to me, said, “Knowest thou the lodging of
Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi?” “I am he,” answered I; and they rejoined,
“Obey the summons of the Commander of the Faithful.”
Then they carried me before Al-Maamun, who said to me, “Who
art thou?” Quoth I, “An associate of the Kazi Abu Yúsuf and
a doctor of the law and traditions.” Asked the Caliph, “By what
surname art thou known?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2053" id="noteref-2053" epub:type="noteref">2053</a> and I answered, “Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi;”
whereupon quoth he, “Expound to me thy case.” So I
recounted to him my case and he wept sore and said to me, “Out
on thee!” The Apostle of Allah (whom Allah bless and assain!)
would not let me sleep this night, because of thee; for in early
darkness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2054" id="noteref-2054" epub:type="noteref">2054</a> he appeared to me and said, “Succour Abu Hassan
al-Ziyadi.” Whereupon I awoke and, knowing thee not, went to
sleep again; but he came to me a second time and said to me,
“Woe to thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi.” I awoke a
second time, but knowing thee not I went to sleep again; and he
came to me a third time and still I knew thee not and went to
sleep again. Then he came to me once more and said, “Out on
thee! Succour Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi!” “After that I dared not
sleep any more, but watched the rest of the night and aroused my
people and sent them on all sides in quest of thee.” Then he gave
me one myriad of dirhams, saying, “This is for the Khorasani,”
and other ten thousand, saying, “Spend freely of this and amend
thy case therewith, and set thine affairs in order.” Moreover, he
presented me with thirty thousand dirhams, saying, “Furnish thyself
with this, and when the Procession-day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2055" id="noteref-2055" epub:type="noteref">2055</a> is being kept, come
thou to me, that I may invest thee with some office.” So I went
forth from him with the money and returned home, where I prayed
the dawn-prayer; and behold, presently came the Khorasani, so I
carried him into the house and brought out to him one myriad of
dirhams, saying, “Here is thy money.” Quoth he, “It is not my
very money; how cometh this?” So I told him the whole story,
and he wept and said, “By Allah, haddest thou told me the fact
at first, I had not pressed thee!; and now, by Allah, I will not
accept aught of this money”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
Khorasani to Al-Ziyadi, “By Allah, haddest thou told me the
fact at first, I had not pressed thee!; and now, by Allah, I will
not accept aught of this money and thou art lawfully quit of it.”
So saying, he went away and I set my affairs in order and repaired
on the Procession-day to Al-Maamun’s Gate, where I found him
seated. When he saw me present myself he called me to him and,
bringing forth to me a paper from under his prayer-carpet, said to
me, “This is a patent, conferring on thee the office of Kazi of the
western division of Al-Medinah, the Holy City, from the Bab-al
Salám<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2056" id="noteref-2056" epub:type="noteref">2056</a> to the furthest limit of the township; and I appoint thee
such and such monthly allowances. So fear Allah (to whom be
honour and glory!) and be mindful of the solicitude of His Apostle
(whom may He bless and keep!) on thine account.” Then the
folk marvelled at the Caliph’s words and asked me their meaning;
whereupon I told them the story from beginning to end and it spread
abroad amongst the people. “And” (quoth he who telleth the tale)
“Abu Hassan al-Ziyadi ceased not to be Kazi of Al-Medinah, the
Holy City, till he died in the days of Al-Maamun—the mercy of
Allah be on him!” And among the tales men tell is one of</p>
