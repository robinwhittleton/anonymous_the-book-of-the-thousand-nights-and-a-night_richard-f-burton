<p>They relate that there was once, in days of yore and in bygone
ages and times long gone before, a king of the kings of the time,
Shah Bakht hight, who had troops and servants and guards in
hosts and a Wazir called Al-Rahwán, who was learned, understanding,
a loyal counsellor and a cheerful acceptor of the commandments
of Almighty Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory.
The king committed to this Minister the affairs of his kingdom
and his lieges and spake according to his word, and in this way he
abode a long space of time. Now this Wazir had many foes, who
envied his position and sought to do him harm, but thereunto
found no way and the Lord, in His immemorial foreknowledge and
His fore-ordinance decreed that the king dreamt that the Minister
Al-Rahwan gave him a fruit from off a tree and he ate it and died.
So he awoke, startled and troubled, and when the Wazir had presented
himself before him and had retired and the king was alone
with those in whom he trusted, he related to them his vision and
they advised him to send for the astrologers and interpreters and
commended to him a Sage, whose skill and wisdom they attested.
Accordingly the king bade him be brought and entreated him with
honour and made him draw near to himself. Now there had been
in private intercourse with that Sage a company of the Wazir’s
enemies, who besought him to slander the Minister to the king
and counsel him to do him dead, in view of what they promised
him of much wealth; and he made agreement with them on this
and acquainted the king that the Minister would slay him within
the coming month and bade him hasten to put him to death, else
would he surely be killed. Presently, the Wazir entered and the
king signed to him to clear the place. So he signed to those who
were present to withdraw, and they withdrew; whereupon quoth
the king to him, “How deemest thou, O Minister of loyal counsel
in all manner of contrivance, concerning a vision I have seen in
my sleep?” “What is it, O king?” asked the Wazir, and Shah
Bakht related to him his dream, adding, “And indeed the Sage
interpreted it to me and said to me:—An thou do not the Wazir
dead within a month, assuredly he will slay thee. Now to put the
like of thee to death, I am loath exceedingly, yet to leave thee on
life do I sorely fear. How then dost thou advise me act in this
affair?” The Wazir bowed his head earthwards awhile, then
raised it and said, “Allah prosper the king! Verily, it availeth
not to continue him on life of whom the king is afraid, and my
counsel is that thou hasten to put me out of the world.” When
the king heard his speech and dove into the depths of his meaning,
he turned to him and said, “’Tis grievous to me, O Wazir of good
rede;” and he told him that the other sages had attested the wit
and wisdom of the astrophil. Now hearing these words Al-Rahwan
sighed and knew that the king went in fear of him; but he showed
him fortitude and said to him, “Allah assain the sovran! My rede
is that the king carry out his commandment and his decree be
dight, for that needs must death be and ’tis fainer to me that I
die oppressed, than that I die an oppressor. But, an the king
judge proper to postpone the putting of me to death till the
morrow and will pass this night with me and farewell me whenas
the morning cometh, the king shall do whatso he willeth.” Then
he wept till he wetted his gray hairs and the king was moved to
ruth for him and granted him that which he craved and vouchsafed
him a respite for that night.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5359" id="noteref-5359" epub:type="noteref">5359</a></p>

and summoned the Wazir, who presented himself and making
his obeisance to the king, kissed ground before him and related

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE MAN OF KHORASAN, HIS SON AND HIS TUTOR</i>.</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a man of Khorasan and he had a son, whose
moral weal he ardently wished; but the young man sought to be
alone and far from the eye of his father, so he might give himself
up to pleasuring and pleasance. Accordingly he sought of his
sire leave to make the pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah and
to visit the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah save and assain!).
Now between them and Meccah was a journey of five hundred
parasangs; but his father could not contrary him, for that the
Holy Law had made pilgrimage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5360" id="noteref-5360" epub:type="noteref">5360</a> incumbent on him and because
of that which he hoped for him of improvement. So he joined
unto him a tutor, in whom he trusted, and gave him much money
and took leave of him. The son set out with his governor on the
holy pilgrimage,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5361" id="noteref-5361" epub:type="noteref">5361</a> and abode on the like wise, spending freely and
using not thrift. Also there was in his neighbourhood a poor
man, who had a slave-girl of passing beauty and grace, and the
youth conceived a desire for her and suffered sore cark and care
for the love of her and her loveliness, so that he was like to
perish for passion; and she also loved him with a love yet greater
than his love for her. Accordingly, the damsel summoned an
old woman who used to visit her and acquainted her with her
case, saying, “An I foregather not with him, I shall die.” The
crone promised her that she would do her best to bring her to
her desire; so she veiled herself and repairing to the young
man, saluted him with the salam and acquainted him with the
girl’s case, saying, “Her master is a greedy wight; so do thou
invite him and lure him with lucre, and he will sell thee the handmaiden.”
Accordingly, he made a banquet, and standing in the
man’s way, invited him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5362" id="noteref-5362" epub:type="noteref">5362</a> and brought him to his house, where
they sat down and ate and drank and abode in talk. Presently,
the young man said to the other, “I hear thou hast with thee a
slave-girl, whom thou desirest to sell;” but he said, “By Allah,
O my lord, I have no mind to sell her!” Quoth the youth, “I
have heard that she cost thee a thousand dinars, and I will give
thee six hundred over and above that sum;” and quoth the other,
“I sell her to thee at that price.” So they fetched notaries who
wrote out the contract of sale, and the young man weighed to the
girl’s master half the purchase money, saying, “Let her be with
thee till I complete to thee the rest of the price and take my
hand-maid.” The owner consented to this and took of him a
written bond for the rest of the money, and the girl abode with
her master, on deposit.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5363" id="noteref-5363" epub:type="noteref">5363</a> As for the youth, he gave his governor a
thousand dirhams and sent him to his sire, to fetch money from him,
so he might pay the rest of the hand-maid’s price, saying to him,
“Be not long away.” But the tutor said in his mind, “How shall
I fare to his father and say to him, Thy son hath wasted thy
money and made love with it?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5364" id="noteref-5364" epub:type="noteref">5364</a> With what eye shall I look
on him and, indeed, I am he in whom he confided and to whom
he hath entrusted his son? Verily, this were ill rede. Nay, I
will fare on with this pilgrimage-caravan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5365" id="noteref-5365" epub:type="noteref">5365</a> in despite of my fool
of a youth; and when he is weary of waiting, he will demand
back his money and return to his father, and I shall be quit of
travail and trouble.” So he went on with the pilgrimage-caravan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5366" id="noteref-5366" epub:type="noteref">5366</a>
and took up his abode there.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5367" id="noteref-5367" epub:type="noteref">5367</a> Meanwhile, the youth tarried
expecting his tutor’s return, but he returned not; wherefore concern
and chagrin grew upon him because of his mistress, and
his yearning for her redoubled and he was like to kill himself.
She became aware of this and sent him a messenger, bidding him
visit her. Accordingly he went to her, and she questioned him of the
case; when he told her what was to do of the matter of his tutor,
and she said to him, “With me is longing the like of that which is
with thee, and I doubt me thy messenger hath perished or thy
father hath slain him; but I will give thee all my jewellery and
my dresses, and do thou sell them and weigh out the rest of my
price, and we will go, I and thou, to thy sire.” So she handed to
him all she had and he sold it and paid the rest of her price;
after which there remained to him for spending-money an
hundred dirhams. These he spent and lay that night with the
damsel in all delight of life, and his sprite was like to fly for joy:
but when he arose in the morning, he sat weeping and the damsel
said to him, “What causeth thee to weep?” Said he, “I
know not an my father be dead, and he hath none other heir
save myself; but how shall I get to him, seeing I own not a
dirham?” Quoth she, “I have a bangle; sell it and buy seed-pearls
with the price: then round them and fashion them into
great unions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5368" id="noteref-5368" epub:type="noteref">5368</a> and thereby thou shalt gain much money, with the
which we may find our way to thy country.” So he took the
bangle and repairing to a goldsmith, said to him, “Break up this
bracelet and sell it;” but he said, “The king seeketh a perfect
bracelet: I will go to him and bring thee its price.” Presently
he bore the bangle to the Sultan and it pleased him greatly
by reason of its goodly workmanship. Then he called an old
woman, who was in his palace, and said to her, “Needs must I
have the mistress of this bracelet though but for a single night, or I
shall die;” and the old woman replied, “I will bring her to thee.”
Thereupon she donned a devotee’s dress and betaking herself
to the goldsmith, said to him, “To whom belongeth the bangle
which is now with the king?” and said he, “It belongeth to a
stranger, who hath bought him a slave-girl from this city and
lodgeth with her in such a place.” Upon this the old woman
repaired to the young man’s house and knocked at the door.
The damsel opened to her and seeing her clad in devotee’s garb,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5369" id="noteref-5369" epub:type="noteref">5369</a>
saluted her with the salam and asked her saying, “Haply thou hast
some need of us?” Answered the old woman, “Yes, I desire a
private place, where I can perform the Wuzu-ablution;” and quoth
the girl, “Enter.” So she entered and did her requirement and
made the ablution and prayed:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5370" id="noteref-5370" epub:type="noteref">5370</a> then she brought out a rosary
and began to tell her beads thereon, and the damsel said to her,
“Whence comest thou, O pilgrimess?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5371" id="noteref-5371" epub:type="noteref">5371</a> Said she, “From visiting
the Idol of the Absent in such a church.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5372" id="noteref-5372" epub:type="noteref">5372</a> There standeth up
no woman before him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5373" id="noteref-5373" epub:type="noteref">5373</a>, who hath a distant friend and discloseth to
him her desire, but he acquainteth her with her case and giveth
her news of her absent one.” Said the damsel “O pilgrimess,
we have an absent one, and my lord’s heart cleaveth to him and
I desire to go question the Idol of him.” Quoth the crone, “Do
thou wait till to-morrow and ask leave of thy spouse, and I will
come to thee and fare with thee in weal and welfare.” Then she
went away, and when the girl’s master came, she sought his permission
to go with the old trot, and he gave her leave. So the beldame
came and took her and carried her to the king’s door, she, unknowing
whither she went. The damsel entered with her and
beheld a goodly house and decorated apartments which were no
idol’s chamber. Then came the king and seeing her beauty and
loveliness, went up to her to buss her; whereupon she fell down in
a fainting fit and struck out with her hands and feet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5374" id="noteref-5374" epub:type="noteref">5374</a> When he
saw this, he held aloof from her in ruth and left her; but the
matter was grievous to her and she refused meat and drink, and
as often as the king drew near to her, she fled from him in fear, so
he swore by Allah that he would not approach her save with her
consent and fell to presenting her with ornaments and raiment;
but her aversion to him only increased. Meanwhile, the youth
her master abode expecting her; but she returned not and his
heart already tasted the bitter draught of separation; so he went
forth at hap-hazard, distracted and knowing not what he should
do, and began strewing dust upon his head and crying out, “The
old woman hath taken her and gone away!” The little boys
followed him with stones and pelted him, crying, “A madman!
A madman!” Presently, the king’s Chamberlain, who was a personage
of years and worth, met him, and when he saw this youth, he
forbade the boys and drave them away from him, after which he
accosted him and asked him of his affair. So he told him his tale
and the Chamberlain said to him, “Fear not! I will deliver thy
slave-girl for thee; so calm thy concern.” And he went on to
speak him fair and comfort him, till he had firm reliance on his
word. Then he carried him to his home and stripping him of his
clothes, clad him in rags; after which he called an old woman,
who was his housekeeper,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5375" id="noteref-5375" epub:type="noteref">5375</a> and said to her, “Take this youth and
bind on his neck yon iron chain and go round about with him in
all the great thoroughfares of the city, and when thou hast done
this, go up with him to the palace of the king.” And he said to
the youth, “In whatsoever stead thou seest the damsel, speak not
a syllable, but acquaint me with her place and thou shalt owe her
deliverance to none save to me.” The youth thanked him and
went with the old woman in such fashion as the Chamberlain bade
him. She fared on with him till they entered the city, and
walked all about it; after which she went up to the palace of
the king and fell to saying, “O fortune’s favourites, look on a
youth whom the devils take twice in the day and pray to be preserved
from such affliction!” And she ceased not to go round
with him till she came to the eastern wing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5376" id="noteref-5376" epub:type="noteref">5376</a> of the palace, whereupon
the slave-girls hurried out to look upon him and when they
saw him they were amazed at his beauty and loveliness and wept
for him. Then they informed the damsel, who came forth and
considered him and knew him not; but he knew her; so he
drooped his head and shed tears. She was moved to pity for him
and gave him somewhat and went back to her place, whilst the
youth returned with the housekeeper to the Chamberlain and told
him that she was in the king’s mansion, whereat he was chagrined
and said, “By Allah, I will assuredly devise a device for her and
deliver her!” Whereupon the youth kissed his hands and feet.
Then he turned to the old woman and bade her change her habit
and her semblance. Now this ancient dame was sweet of speech
and winsome of wit; so he gave her costly and delicious ottars
and said to her, “Get thee to the king’s slave-girls and sell them
these essences and win thy way to the damsel and ask her if she
desire her master or not.” So the old woman went out and
making her way to the palace, went in to the hand-maid and drew
near her and recited these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Allah preserve our Union-days and their delights. ✿ Ah me! How sweet was life! how joys were ever new!</div>
      <div class="line">May he not be who cursed us twain with parting day; ✿ How many a bone he brake, how many a life he slew!</div>
      <div class="line">He shed my faultless tear-floods and my sinless blood; ✿ And beggaring me of love himself no richer grew.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When the damsel heard the old woman’s verses, she wept till
her clothes were drenched and drew near the speaker, who asked
her, “Knowest thou such-an-one?” And she wept and answered,
“He is my lord. Whence knowest thou him?” Rejoined the
old woman, “O my lady, sawest thou not the madman who came
hither yesterday with the old woman? He was thy lord,” presently
adding, “But this is no time for talk. When ’tis night, get thee
to the top of the palace and wait on the terrace till thy lord come
to thee and compass thy deliverance.” Then she gave her what
she would of perfumes and returning to the Chamberlain, acquainted
him with whatso had passed, and he told the youth. Now as soon
as it was evening, the Chamberlain bade bring two hackneys and
great store of water and provaunt and a riding-camel and a fellow
to show them the way. These he ambushed without the town
whilst he and the young man, taking with them a long rope, made
fast to a staple, went and stood below the palace. Whenas they
came thither, they looked and behold, the damsel was standing on
the terrace-roof, so they threw her the rope and the staple, which she
made fast, and tucking up her sleeves above her wrists, slid down
and landed with them. They carried her without the town, where
they mounted, she and her lord, and fared on, with the guide in
front,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5377" id="noteref-5377" epub:type="noteref">5377</a> directing them on the way, and they ceased not faring night
and day till they entered his father’s house. The young man
greeted his sire, who was gladdened in him, and to whom he related
all that had befallen him, whereupon he rejoiced in his safety. As
for the tutor, he wasted whatso was with him and returned to the
city, where he saw the youth and excused himself. Then he questioned
him of what had betided him and he told him, whereat he
admired and returned to companionship with him; but the youth
ceased to have regard for him and gave him nor solde nor ration
as was his wont, neither discovered to him aught of his secrets.
When the tutor saw that there was no profit from him he returned
to the king, the ravisher of the slave-girl, and recounted to him
what the Chamberlain had done and counselled him to slay that
official and egged him on to recover the damsel, promising to
give his friend a poison-draught and return. Accordingly the
king sent for the Chamberlain and chid him for the deed he
had done; whereat the king’s servants incontinently fell upon
the Chamberlain and put him to death. Meanwhile the tutor
returned to the youth, who asked him of his absence, and he told
him that he had been in the city of the king who had taken
the slave-girl. When the youth heard this, he misdoubted of his
governor and never again trusted him in anything but was always on
his guard against him. Then the tutor without stay or delay caused
prepare great store of sweetmeats and put in them deadly poison
and presented them to the youth, who, when he saw those sweetmeats,
said to himself, “This is an extraordinary thing of the
tutor! Needs must there be in this sweetmeat some mischief, and
I will make proof of his confectionery upon himself.” Accordingly
he got ready food and set amongst it a portion of the sweetmeat, and
inviting the governor to his house placed the provaunt before him.
He ate, and amongst the rest which they brought him, the poisoned
sweetmeat; so while in the act of eating he died; whereby the
youth knew that this was a plot against himself and said,
“Whoso seeketh his fortune by his own force<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5378" id="noteref-5378" epub:type="noteref">5378</a> attaineth a failure.”
“Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this, O king of the age, stranger
than the story of the Druggist and his Wife and the Singer.”
When King Shah Bakht heard the tale of Al-Rahwan he gave
him leave to withdraw to his own house and he tarried there the
rest of the night and the next day till eventide evened.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the king sat private in his sitting-chamber
and his mind was occupied with the story of the Singer
and the Druggist. So he called the Wazir and bade him tell the
tale. Answered he, “I will well. They recount, O my lord, the
following</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>TALE OF THE SINGER AND THE DRUGGIST</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once in the city of Hamadán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5379" id="noteref-5379" epub:type="noteref">5379</a> a young man of seemly
semblance and skilled in singing to the lute; wherefore he was
well seen of the citizens. He went forth one day of his home with
intent to travel, and gave not over journeying till his travel brought
him to a town and a goodly. Now he had with him a lute and its
appurtenance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5380" id="noteref-5380" epub:type="noteref">5380</a> so he entered and went round about the streets till
he happened upon a druggist who, when he espied him, called to
him. So he went up to him and he bade him sit down; accordingly,
the youth sat down by his side, and the druggist questioned him of
his case. The singer told him what was in his mind, and the
pharmacist took him up into his shop and bought him food and
fed him. Then said he to him, “Rise and take up thy lute and
beg about the streets, and whenas thou smellest the reek of wine,
break in upon the drinkers and say to them, I am a singer.
They will laugh and cry, Come in to us. And when thou
singest, the folk will know thee and speak one to other of thee;
so shalt thou become known about town, and thou shalt better
thy business.” He went round about, as the druggist bade him,
till the sun waxed hot, but found none drinking. Then he entered
a lane, that he might take rest, and seeing there a handsome house
and a lofty, stood in its shade and fell to observing the excellence
of its edification. Now while he was thus engaged, behold, a casement
opened and there appeared thereat a face, as it were the
moon. Quoth the owner of the face, “What aileth thee to stand
there? Dost thou want aught?” And quoth he, “I am a
stranger,” and acquainted her with his adventure; whereupon
asked she, “What sayst thou to meat and drink and the enjoyment
of a fair face and getting thee spending-money?” And he
answered, “O mistress mine, this is my desire whereof I am going
about in quest!” So she opened the door to him and brought him
in: then she seated him at the upper end of the room and served
him with food. He ate and drank and lay with her and futtered
her. This ended, she sat down in his lap and they toyed and laughed
and exchanged kisses till the day was half done, when her husband
came home and she had no recourse but to hide the singer
in a mat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5381" id="noteref-5381" epub:type="noteref">5381</a>, in which she rolled him up. The husband entered and
seeing the battle-place<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5382" id="noteref-5382" epub:type="noteref">5382</a> disordered and smelling the reek of liquor
questioned her of this. Quoth she, “I had with me a bosom friend
of mine and I conjured her to crack a cup with me; and so we
drank a jar full, I and she, and but now, before thy coming in,
she fared forth.” Her husband deemed her words true and went
away to his shop, he being none other than the singer’s friend the
druggist, who had invited him and fed him; whereupon the lover
came forth and he and the lady returned to their pleasant pastime
and abode on this wise till evening, when she gave him
money and said to him, “To-morrow in the forenoon come
hither to me.” He replied, “Yes,” and departed; and at nightfall
he went to the Hammam-bath. On the morrow, he betook
himself to the shop of his friend the druggist, who welcomed
him as soon as he saw him, and questioned him of his case and
how he had fared that day. Quoth the singer, “Allah requite
thee with welfare, O my brother, for indeed thou hast directed me
to a restful life!” Then he acquainted him with his adventure
and told him the tale of the woman, till he came to the mention of
her husband, when he said, “And at midday came the horned
cuckold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5383" id="noteref-5383" epub:type="noteref">5383</a> her husband, and knocked at the door. So she wrapped
me in the mat, and when he had wended his ways I came forth
and we returned to our pleasant play.” This was grievous to the
druggist, and he repented of having taught him how he should do
and suspected his wife. Accordingly he asked the singer, “And
what said she to thee at thy going away?” and the other
answered, “She said, Come back to me on the morrow. So,
behold, I am off to her and I came not hither but that I might
acquaint thee with this, lest thy thoughts be pre-occupied with
me.” Then he farewelled him, and walked out. As soon as the
druggist was assured that he had reached the house, he cast the
net<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5384" id="noteref-5384" epub:type="noteref">5384</a> over his shop and made for his home, in some suspicion of his
wife, and knocked at the door. Now the singer had entered and
the druggist’s wife said to him, “Up with thee and enter this chest.”
Accordingly he entered it and she shut it down on him and opened
to her husband, who came in all distraught, and searched the house
but found none and overlooked the chest. Hereat he said in his mind
“The house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5385" id="noteref-5385" epub:type="noteref">5385</a> is one which favoureth my house and the woman is
one who favoureth my wife,” and returned to his shop; whereupon
the singer came forth of the chest and falling upon the druggist’s
wife, had his wicked will of her and spent upon her what was her
due, and weighed down the scale for her with full measure. Then
they ate and drank and kissed and clipped necks, and in this way
they abode till the evening, when she gave him money, because she
found his weaving nice and good,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5386" id="noteref-5386" epub:type="noteref">5386</a> and made him promise to come to
her on the morrow. So he left her and slept his night and on the
morrow he returned to the shop of his friend the druggist and saluted
him. The other welcomed him and questioned him of his case;
whereat he told his tale till he ended with the mention of the
woman’s husband, when he said, “Then came the horned cuckold, her
mate and she stowed me away in the chest and shut down the lid
upon me, whilst her addlepated pander<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5387" id="noteref-5387" epub:type="noteref">5387</a> of a husband went about
the house, top and bottom; and when he had gone his way, we
returned to our pleasant pastime.” With this, the druggist was
assured that the house was his house and the wife his wife, and
quoth he, “Now what wilt thou do to-day?” Quoth the singer,
“I shall return to her and weave for her and full her yarn<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5388" id="noteref-5388" epub:type="noteref">5388</a>, and I
came not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5389" id="noteref-5389" epub:type="noteref">5389</a> save to thank thee for thy dealing with me.” Then
he went away, whilst the fire was loosed in the heart of the
druggist and he shut his shop and returning to his house, rapped
at the door. Said the singer, “Let me jump into the chest, for he
saw me not yesterday;” but said she, “No! wrap thyself up in
the mat.” So he wrapped himself up and stood in a corner of the
room, whilst the druggist entered and went no whither else save
to the chest, but found naught inside. Then he walked round
about the house and searched it, top and bottom, but came upon
nothing and no one and abode between belief and disbelief, and
said to himself, “Haply, I suspect my wife of what is not in her.”
So he was certified of her innocence and going forth content,
returned to his shop, whereupon out came the singer and they
resumed their former little game, as was their wont, till eventide
when she gave him one of her husband’s shirts and he took it and
going away, nighted in his own lodging. Next morning he
repaired to the druggist, who saluted him with the salam and came
to meet him and rejoiced in him and smiled in his face, deeming
his wife innocent. Then he questioned him of his case on yesterday
and he told him how he had fared, saying, “O my brother,
when the cornute knocked at the door, I would have jumped into
the chest; but his wife forbade me and rolled me up in the mat.
The man entered and thought of nothing save the chest; so he
brake it open and woned like one jinn-mad, going up and coming
down. Then he went about his business and I came out and we
abode on our accustomed case till eventide, when she gave me
this shirt of her husband’s; and behold, I am now off to her.”
When the druggist heard the singer’s words, he was assured of
the adventure and knew that the calamity, all of it, was in his own
house and that the wife was his wife; and he considered the shirt,
whereupon he redoubled in assuredness and said to the singer,
“Art thou now going to her?” Said he, “Yes, O my brother,”
and taking leave of him, went away; whereupon the druggist
started up, as he were stark mad, and dismantled his shop.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5390" id="noteref-5390" epub:type="noteref">5390</a>
Whilst he was thus doing, the singer won to the house, and presently
up came the druggist and knocked at the door. The lover
would have wrapped himself up in the mat, but she forbade him
and said, “Get thee down to the ground floor of the house and
enter the oven-jar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5391" id="noteref-5391" epub:type="noteref">5391</a> and close the cover upon thyself.” So he did
her bidding and she went down to her husband and opened the
door to him, whereupon he came in and went round the house,
but found no one and overlooked the oven-jar. Then he stood
musing and sware that he would not again go forth of the house
till the morrow. As for the singer, when his stay in the oven-jar
grew longsome upon him, he came forth therefrom, thinking that
her husband had gone away; and he went up to the terrace-roof
and looking down, beheld his friend the druggist: whereat
he was sore concerned and said in himself, “Alas, the disgrace,
ah! This is my friend the druggist, who of me was fain and
dealt me fair and I have paid him with foul.” He feared to return
to the druggist; so he stepped down and opened the first door
and would have gone out at a venture, unseen of the husband;
but, when he came to the outer door, he found it locked and saw
not the key. Hereat he returned to the terrace and began dropping
from roof to roof till the people of the house heard him
and hastened to fall upon him, deeming him a thief. Now that
house belonged to a Persian man; so they laid hands on him
and the house-master fell to beating him, saying to him, “Thou
art a thief.” He replied, “No I am not a thief, but a singing-man,
a stranger who, hearing your voices, came to sing to you.” When
the folk heard his words, they talked of letting him go; but the
Persian said, “O folk, let not his speech cozen you. This one is
none other than a thief who knoweth how to sing, and when he
cometh upon the like of us, he is a singer.” Said they, “O our
lord, this man is a stranger, and needs we must release him.”
Quoth he, “By Allah, my heart heaveth at this fellow! Let me
kill him with beating;” but quoth they, “Thou mayst no ways do
that.” So they delivered the singer from the Persian, the master
of the house, and seated him amongst them, whereupon he began
singing to them and they rejoiced in him. Now the Persian had
a Mameluke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5392" id="noteref-5392" epub:type="noteref">5392</a> as he were the full moon, and he arose and went
out, and the singer followed him and wept before him, professing
lustful love to him and kissing his hands and feet. The Mameluke
took compassion on him and said to him, “When the night
cometh and my master entereth the Harim and the folk fare
away, I will grant thee thy desire; and I sleep in such a place.”
Then the singer returned and sat with the cup-companions, and
the Persian rose and went out with the Mameluke by his side.
Now<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5393" id="noteref-5393" epub:type="noteref">5393</a> the singer knew the place which the Mameluke occupied at
the first of the night; but it chanced that the youth rose from his
stead and the waxen taper went out. The Persian, who was
drunk, fell over on his face, and the singer supposing him to be the
Mameluke, said, “By Allah, ’tis good!” and threw himself upon
him and began to work at his bag-trousers till the string was
loosed; then he brought out<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5394" id="noteref-5394" epub:type="noteref">5394</a> his prickle upon which he spat and
slipped it into him. Thereupon the Persian started up, crying
out and, laying hands on the singer, pinioned him and beat him
a grievous beating, after which he bound him to a tree that stood in
the house-court. Now there was in the house a beautiful singing-girl
and when she saw the singer tight pinioned and tied to the tree,
she waited till the Persian lay down on his couch, when she arose
and going up to the singer, fell to condoling with him over what
had betided him and making eyes at him and handling his yard
and rubbing it, till it rose upright. Then said she to him, “Do
with me the deed of kind and I will loose thy pinion-bonds, lest he
return and beat thee again; for he purposeth thee an ill purpose.”
Quoth he, “Loose me and I will do it;” but quoth she, “I fear
that, an I loose thee, thou wilt not do it. But I will do it and
thou have me standing; and when I have done, I will loose thee.”
So saying, she opened her clothes and introducing the singer’s
prickle, fell to toing and froing.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5395" id="noteref-5395" epub:type="noteref">5395</a> Now there was in the house a
fighting-ram, which the Persian had trained to butting,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5396" id="noteref-5396" epub:type="noteref">5396</a> and when
he saw what the woman was doing, he thought she wished to do
battle with him; so he broke his halter and running at her, butted
her and split her skull. She fell on her back and shrieked;
whereupon the Persian started up hastily from sleep and seeing
the singing-girl on her back and the singer with yard on end,
cried to him, “O accursed, doth not what thou hast erewhile done
suffice thee?” Then he beat him a shrewd beating and opening
the door, thrust him out in the middle of the night. He lay the rest
of the dark hours in one of the ruins, and when he arose in the
morning, he said, “None is in fault! I, for one, sought my own
good, and he is no fool who seeketh good for himself; and the
druggist’s wife also sought good for herself; but Predestination
overcometh Precaution and for me there remaineth no tarrying in
this town.” So he went forth from the place. “Nor” (continued
the Wazir), “is this story, strange though it be, stranger than that
of the King and his Son and that which betided them of wonders
and rare marvels.” When the king heard this story, he deemed it
pretty and pleasant and said, “This tale is near unto that which I
know and ’tis my rede I should do well to have patience and hasten
not to slay my Minister, so I may get of him the profitable story
of the King and his Son.” Then he gave the Wazir leave to go
away to his own house; so he thanked him and tarried in his
home all that day.</p>

<p class="c000">When it was supper-time the king sought the sitting-chamber;
and, summoning the Wazir, sought of him the story he had
promised him; and the Minister said, “They tell, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE KING WHO KENNED THE QUINTESSENCE<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5397" id="noteref-5397" epub:type="noteref">5397</a> OF THINGS</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There came to a king of the kings, in his old age, a son, who grew
up comely, quick-witted, clever: and, when he reached years of
discretion and became a young man, his father said to him, “Take
this realm and rule it in lieu of me, for I desire to flee from the sin
of sovranty<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5398" id="noteref-5398" epub:type="noteref">5398</a> to Allah the Most High and don the woollen dress
and devote all my time to devotion.” Quoth the Prince, “And I
am another who desireth to take refuge with the Almighty.” So the
king said, “Arise, let us flee forth and make for the mountains and
there worship in shame before God the Most Great.” Accordingly,
the twain gat them gear of wool and clothing themselves therewith,
fared forth and wandered in the wolds and wastes; but, when
some days had passed over them, both became weak for hunger
and repented them of that they had done whenas penitence
profited them not, and the Prince complained to his father of
weariness and hunger. Cried the king, “Dear my son, I did with
thee that which behoved me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5399" id="noteref-5399" epub:type="noteref">5399</a> but thou wouldst not hearken to me,
and now there is no means of returning to thy former estate, for
that another hath taken the kingdom and defendeth it from all
foes: but indeed I will counsel thee of somewhat, wherein do thou
pleasure me by compliance.” The Prince asked, “What is it?”
and his father answered, “Take me and go with me to the market-street
and sell me and receive my price and do with it whatso thou
willest, and I shall become the property of one who shall provide
for my wants.” The Prince enquired, “Who will buy thee of me,
seeing thou art a very old man? Nay, do thou rather sell me, inasmuch
as the demand for me will be more.” But the king replied,
“An thou wert king, thou wouldest require service of me.” Accordingly
the youth obeyed his father’s bidding and taking him, carried
him to the slave-dealer and said, “Sell me this old man.” Said the
dealer, “Who will buy this wight, and he a son of eighty years?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5400" id="noteref-5400" epub:type="noteref">5400</a>
Then quoth he to the king, “In what crafts art thou cunning?” and
quoth he, “I ken the quintessence of jewels and I ken the quintessence
of horses and I ken the quintessence of men; brief, I
ken the quintessence of all things.” So the slave-dealer took
him and went about, offering him for sale to the folk; but none
would buy. Presently, up came the Chef of the Sultan’s kitchen
and asked, “What is this man?” and the dealer answered, “This
be a Mameluke for sale.” The kitchener marvelled at this and
bought the king, after questioning him of what he could do, for
ten thousand dirhams. Then he weighed out the money and
carried him to his house, but dared not employ him in aught of
service; so he appointed him an allowance, a modicum sufficient
for his maintenance, and repented him of having bought him,
saying, “What shall I do with the like of this wight?” Presently,
the king of the city was minded to go forth to his garden,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5401" id="noteref-5401" epub:type="noteref">5401</a>
a-pleasuring, and bade the cook precede him and appoint in his
stead one who should dress the royal meat, so that, when he
returned, he might find the meal ready. The Chef fell to thinking
of whom he should appoint and was perplexed concerning his
affair. As he was thus, the Shaykh came to him, and seeing him
distraught as to how he should do, said to him, “Tell me what is
in thy mind; haply I may bring thee relief.” So he acquainted
him with the king’s wishes and he said, “Have no care for this,
but leave me one of the serving-men and do thou go companying
thy lord in peace and surety, for I will suffice thee of this.” Hereat
the cook departed with the king, after he had brought the old man
what he needed and left him a man of the guards; and when he was
gone, the Shaykh bade the trooper wash the kitchen-battery and
made ready food exceedingly fine. When the king returned he
set the meat before him, and he tasted dishes whose like he had
never savoured; whereat he was startled and asked who had
dressed it. Accordingly they acquainted him with the Shaykh’s
case and he summoned him to his presence and asking him anent
the mystery, increased his allowance of rations;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5402" id="noteref-5402" epub:type="noteref">5402</a> moreover, he
bade that they should cook together, he and the kitchener, and the
old man obeyed his bidding. Some time after this, there came
two merchants to the king with two pearls of price and each of
them declared that his pearl was worth a thousand dinars, but the
folk was incompetent to value them. Then said the cook, “Allah
prosper the king! Verily, the Shaykh whom I bought affirmed
that he knew the quintessence of jewels and that he was skilled in
cookery. We have tried him in his cuisine, and have found him
the most knowing of men; and now, if we send after him and
prove him on jewels, his second claim will be made manifest to us,
whether true or false.” So the king bade fetch the Shaykh and he
came and stood before the Sultan, who showed him the two pearls.
Quoth he, “Now for this one, ’tis worth a thousand dinars;” and
quoth the king, “So saith its owner.” “But for this other,”
continued the old man, “’tis worth only five hundred.” The people
laughed and admired his saying, and the merchant who owned the
second pearl asked him, “How can this, which is bigger of bulk
and worthier for water and righter of rondure, be less of value than
that?” and the old man answered, “I have said what is with me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5403" id="noteref-5403" epub:type="noteref">5403</a>
Then quoth the king to him, “Indeed, the outer semblance thereof
is like that of the other pearl; why then is it worth but the half
of its price?” and quoth the old man, “Yes, but its inward is
corrupt.” Asked the merchant, “Hath a pearl then an inward and
an outward?” and the Shaykh answered, “Yea! In its interior is
a teredo, a boring worm; but the other pearl is sound and secure
against breakage.” The merchant continued, “Give us approof
of this thy knowledge and confirm to us the truth of thy saying;”
and the old man rejoined, “We will break it: an I prove a liar,
here is my head, and if I speak sooth, thou wilt have lost thy
pearl;” and the merchant said, “I agree to that.” So they brake
the pearl and it was even as the old man had declared, to wit, in
the heart of it was a boring worm. The king marvelled at what
he saw and questioned him of how he came by the knowledge of
this. The Shaykh replied, “O king, this kind of jewel is engendered
in the belly of a creature called the oyster<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5404" id="noteref-5404" epub:type="noteref">5404</a> and its origin is a
drop of rain and it resisteth the touch and groweth not warm
whilst hent in hand:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5405" id="noteref-5405" epub:type="noteref">5405</a> so, when its outer coat became tepid to my
touch, I knew that it harboured some living thing, for that things
of life thrive not save in heat.” Therefore the king said to the
cook, “Increase his allowance;” and the Chef appointed to him
fresh rations. Now some time after this, two merchants presented
themselves to the king with two horses, and one said, “I
ask a thousand ducats for my horse,” and the other, “I seek five
thousand ducats for mine.” Quoth the cook, “We are now
familiar with the old man’s just judgment; what deemeth the king
of fetching him?” So the king bade fetch him, and when he saw
the two horses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5406" id="noteref-5406" epub:type="noteref">5406</a> he said, “This is worth a thousand and that two
thousand ducats.” Quoth the folk, “This horse thou misjudgest
is evidently a thoroughbred and he is younger and faster and compacter
of limb and finer of head and clearer of colour and skin
than the other;” presently adding, “What assurance hast thou of
the sooth of thy saying?” And the old man said, “This ye state
is true, all true; but his sire is old and this other is the son of a
young horse. Now, when the son of an old horse standeth still
a-breathing, his breath returneth not to him and his rider falleth
into the hand of him who followeth after him; but the son of a
young horse, an thou put him to speed and after making him run,
alight from him, thou wilt find him, by reason of his robustness,
untired.” Quoth the merchant, “’Tis even as the Shaykh avoucheth
and he is an excellent judge.” And the king said, “Increase his
allowance.” But the Shaykh stood still and did not go away; so
the king asked him, “Why dost thou not go about thy business?”
and he answered, “My business is with the king.” Said the king,
“Name what thou wouldest have,” and the other replied, “I would
have thee question me of the quintessence of men, even as thou
hast questioned me of the quintessence of horses.” Quoth the
king, “We have no occasion to question thee thereof;” but quoth
the old man, “I have occasion to acquaint thee.” “Say what
thou wilt,” rejoined the king, and the Shaykh said, “Verily, the
king is the son of a baker.” Cried the king, “How and whereby
kennest thou that?” and the Shaykh replied, “Know, O king, that
I have examined into degrees and dignities<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5407" id="noteref-5407" epub:type="noteref">5407</a> and have learned this.”
Thereupon the king went in to his mother and asked her anent his
sire, and she told him that the king her husband was impotent;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5408" id="noteref-5408" epub:type="noteref">5408</a>
“So,” quoth she, “I feared for the kingdom, lest it pass away,
after his death; wherefore I yielded my person to a young man, a
baker, and conceived by him and bare a man-child;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5409" id="noteref-5409" epub:type="noteref">5409</a> and the
kingship came into the hand of my son, that is, thyself.” So the
king returned to the Shaykh and said to him, “I am indeed the
son of a baker; so do thou expound to me the means whereby
thou knewest me for this.” Quoth the other, “I knew that, hadst
thou been the son of a king, thou wouldst have gifted me with
things of price, such as rubies and the like; and wert thou the son
of a Kazi, thou hadst given largesse of a dirham or two dirhams,
and wert thou the son of any of the merchants, thou hadst given
me muchel of money. But I saw that thou bestowedst upon me
naught save two bannocks of bread and other rations, wherefore
I knew thee to be the son of a baker;” and quoth the king, “Thou
hast hit the mark.” Then he gave him wealth galore and advanced
him to high estate. The tale aforesaid pleased King Shah Bakht
and he marvelled thereat; but the Wazir said to him, “This story
is not stranger than that of the Richard who married his beautiful
daughter to the poor Shaykh.” The king’s mind was occupied
with the promised tale and he bade the Wazir withdraw to his
lodging; so he went and abode there the rest of the night and the
whole of the following day.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the king sat private in his sitting-chamber
and bade fetch the Wazir. When he presented himself
before him, he said to him, “Tell me the tale of the Richard.”
The Minister replied, “I will. Hear, O puissant king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE RICHARD WHO MARRIED HIS BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER TO THE POOR OLD MAN</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">A certain rich merchant had a beautiful daughter, who was as
the full moon, and when she attained the age of fifteen, her father
betook himself to an old man and spreading him a carpet in his
sitting-chamber, gave him to eat and conversed and caroused
with him. Then said he to him, “I desire to marry thee to my
daughter.” The other drew back, because of his poverty, and said
to him, “I am no husband for her nor am I a match for thee.”
The merchant was urgent with him, but he repeated his answer to
him, saying, “I will not consent to this till thou acquaint me with
the cause of thy desire for me. An I find it reasonable, I will fall
in with thy wish; and if not, I will not do this ever.” Quoth the
merchant, “Thou must know that I am a man from the land of
China and was in my youth well-favoured and well-to-do. Now I
made no account of womankind, one and all, but followed after
youths<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5410" id="noteref-5410" epub:type="noteref">5410</a>, and one night I saw, in a dream, as it were a balance set
up, and hard by it a voice said, ‘This is the portion of Such-an-one.’
I listened and presently I heard my own name; so I looked
and behold, there stood a woman loathly to the uttermost; whereupon
I awoke in fear and cried, ‘I will never marry, lest haply this
fulsome female fall to my lot.’ Then I set out for this city with
merchandise and the journey was pleasant to me and the sojourn
here, so that I took up my abode in the place for a length of time
and gat me friends and factors. At last I sold all my stock-in-trade
and collected its price and there was left me nothing to
occupy me till the folk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5411" id="noteref-5411" epub:type="noteref">5411</a> should depart and I depart with them.
One day, I changed my clothes and putting gold into my sleeve,
sallied forth to inspect the holes and corners of this city, and as I
was wandering about, I saw a handsome house: its seemliness
pleased me; so I stood looking on it and beheld a lovely woman
at the window. When she saw me, she made haste and descended,
whilst I abode confounded. Then I betook myself to a tailor
there and questioned him of the house and anent whose it was.”
Quoth he, “It belongeth to Such-an-one the Notary,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5412" id="noteref-5412" epub:type="noteref">5412</a> God damn
him!” I asked, “Is he her sire?” and he answered, “Yes.” So
I repaired in great hurry to a man, with whom I had been wont to
deposit my goods for sale, and told him I desired to gain access
to Such-an-one the Notary. Accordingly he assembled his friends
and we betook ourselves to the Notary’s house. When we came
in to him, we saluted him and sat with him, and I said to him, “I
come to thee as a suitor, desiring in marriage the hand of thy
daughter.” He replied, “I have no daughter befitting this man;”
and I rejoined, “Allah aid thee! My desire is for thee and not for
her.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5413" id="noteref-5413" epub:type="noteref">5413</a> But he still refused and his friends said to him, “This is an
honourable match and a man thine equal, nor is it lawful to thee
that thou hinder the young lady of her good luck.” Quoth he to
them, “She will not suit him!” nevertheless they were instant
with him till at last he said, “Verily, my daughter whom ye seek
is passing ill-favoured and in her are all blamed qualities of person.”
And I said, “I accept her, though she be as thou sayest.” Then said
the folk, “Extolled be Allah! Cease we to talk of a thing settled;
so say the word, how much wilt thou have to her marriage-settlement?”
Quoth he, “I must have four thousand sequins;” and
I said, “To hear is to obey!” Accordingly the affair was concluded
and we drew up the contract of marriage and I made the
bride-feast; but on the wedding-night I beheld a thing<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5414" id="noteref-5414" epub:type="noteref">5414</a> than which
never made Allah Almighty aught more fulsome. Methought her
folk had devised this freak byway of fun; so I laughed and looked
for my mistress, whom I had seen at the window, to make her
appearance; but saw her not. When the affair was prolonged and
I found none but her, I was like to lose my wits for vexation and
fell to beseeching my Lord and humbling myself in supplication
before Him that He would deliver me from her. When I arose
in the morning, there came the chamberwoman and said to me,
“Hast thou need of the bath<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5415" id="noteref-5415" epub:type="noteref">5415</a>?” I replied, “No”; and she asked,
“Art thou for breakfast?” But I still answered “No;” and on this
wise I abode three days, tasting neither meat nor drink. When
the young woman my wife saw me in this plight, she said to me,
“O man, tell me thy tale, for, by Allah, if I may effect thy deliverance,
I will assuredly further thee thereto.” I gave ear to her
speech and put faith in her sooth and acquainted her with the
adventure of the damsel whom I had seen at the window and how
I had fallen in love with her; whereupon quoth she, “An that
girl belong to me, whatso I possess is thine, and if she belong to
my sire, I will demand her of him and detain her from him and
deliver her to thee.” Then she fell to summoning hand-maid after
hand-maid and showing them to me, till I saw the damsel whom I
loved and said, “This is she.” Quoth my wife, “Let not thy heart
be troubled, for this is my slave-girl. My father gave her to
me and I give her to thee:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5416" id="noteref-5416" epub:type="noteref">5416</a> so comfort thyself and be of good
cheer and of eyes cool and clear.” Then, when it was night, she
brought the girl to me, after she had adorned her and perfumed
her, and said to her, “Cross not this thy lord in aught and every
that he shall seek of thee.” When she came to bed with me, I
said in myself, “Verily, this my spouse is more generous than I!”
Then I sent away the slave-girl and drew not near her, but arose
forthwith and betaking myself to my wife, lay with her and abated
her maidenhead. She conceived by me at the first bout; and,
accomplishing the time of her pregnancy, gave birth to this dear
little daughter; in whom I rejoiced, for that she was beautiful
exceedingly, and she hath inherited her mother’s sound sense and
the comeliness of her sire. Indeed, many of the notables of the
people have sought her of me in wedlock, but I would not wed her
to any, because I saw in a dream, one night, that same balance set
up and men and women being therein weighed, one against other,
and meseemed I saw thee and her and the voice said to me, ‘This
is such a man, the portion of such a woman.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5417" id="noteref-5417" epub:type="noteref">5417</a> Wherefore I knew
that Almighty Allah had allotted unto her none other than thyself,
and I choose rather to marry thee to her in my lifetime than
that thou shouldst marry her after my death.” When the poor
man heard the merchant’s story, he became desirous of wedding
his daughter: so he took her to wife and was blessed of her with
exceeding love. “Nor” (continued the Wazir), “is this story on
any wise stranger or this tale rarer than that of the Sage and his
three Sons.” When the king heard his Minister’s story, he was
assured that he would not slay him and said, “I will have patience
with him, so I may get of him the story of the Sage and his
three Sons.” And he bade him depart to his own house.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the king sat private in his chamber
and summoning the Wazir, required of him the promised story.
So Al-Rahwan said, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE SAGE AND HIS THREE SONS</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5418" id="noteref-5418" epub:type="noteref">5418</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a Sage of the sages, who had three sons and
sons’ sons, and when they waxed many and their seed multiplied,
there befel dissension between them. So he assembled them and
said to them, “Be ye single-handed against all others and despise
not one another lest the folk despise you, and know that your
case is the case of the man and the rope which he cut easily, when
it was single; then he doubled it and could not cut it: on this
wise is division and union.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5419" id="noteref-5419" epub:type="noteref">5419</a> And beware lest ye seek help of
others against your own selves or ye will fall into perdition, for by
what means soever ye win your wish at his hand, his word will rank
higher than your word. Now I have money which I will presently
bury in a certain place, that it may be a store for you against the
time of your need.” Then they left him and dispersed and one of
the sons fell to spying upon his sire, so that he saw him hide the
hoard outside the city. When he had made an end of burying it, the
Sage returned to his house; and as soon as the morning morrowed,
his son repaired to the place where he had seen his father bury
the treasure and dug and took all the wealth he found and fared forth.
When the old man felt that his death<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5420" id="noteref-5420" epub:type="noteref">5420</a> drew nigh, he called his sons
to him and acquainted them with the place where he had hidden
his hoard. As soon as he was dead, they went and dug up the
treasure and came upon much wealth, for that the money, which the
first son had taken singly and by stealth, was on the surface and
he knew not that under it were other monies. So they carried it
off and divided it and the first son claimed his share with the rest
and added it to that which he had before taken, behind the backs
of his father and his brethren. Then he married his cousin,
the daughter of his father’s brother and was blessed through her
with a male-child, who was the goodliest of the folk of his time.
When the boy grew up, his father feared for him poverty and
decline of case, so he said to him, “Dear my son, know that during
my green days I wronged my brothers in the matter of our father’s
good, and I see thee in weal; but, an thou come to want, ask
not one of them nor any other than they, for I have laid up
for thee in yonder chamber a treasure; but do not thou open it
until thou come to lack thy daily bread.” Then the man died,
and his money, which was a great matter, fell to his son. The
young man had not patience to wait till he had made an end
of that which was with him, but rose and opened the chamber,
and behold, it was empty and its walls were whitened, and in
its midst was a rope hanging down as for a bucket and ten
bricks, one upon other, and a scroll, wherein was written, “There
is no help against death; so hang thyself and beg not of any, but
kick away the bricks with thy toes, that there may be no escape for
thy life, and thou shalt be at rest from the exultation of enemies and
enviers and the bitterness of beggary.” Now when the youth saw
this, he marvelled at that which his father had done and said,
“This is an ill treasure.” Then he went forth and fell to eating
and drinking with the folk, till naught was left him and he passed
two days without tasting food, at the end of which time he took a
handkerchief and selling it for two dirhams, bought bread and
milk with the price and left it on the shelf and went out. Whilst
he was gone, a dog came and seized the bread and polluted the
milk, and when the young man returned and saw this, he beat
his face, and fared forth distraught. Presently, he met a friend,
to whom he discovered his case, and the other said to him, “Art
thou not ashamed to talk thus? How hast thou wasted all this
wealth and now comest telling lies and saying, The dog hath
mounted on the shelf, and talking such nonsense?” And he
reviled him. So the youth returned to his house, and verily the
world had waxed black in his eyes and he cried, “My sire said
sooth.” Then he opened the chamber door and piling up the
bricks under his feet, put the rope about his neck and kicked
away the bricks and swung himself off; whereupon the rope gave
way with him and he fell to the ground and the ceiling clave
asunder and there poured down on him a world of wealth. So he
knew that his sire meant to chasten him by means of this and
he invoked Allah’s mercy on him. Then he got him again that
which he had sold of lands and houses and what not else and
became once more in good case; his friends also returned to him
and he entertained them for some time. Then said he to them one
day, “There was with us bread and the locusts ate it; so we set in
its place a stone, one cubit long and the like broad, and the
locusts came and nibbled away the stone, because of the smell of
the bread.” Quoth one of his friends (and it was he who had
given him the lie concerning the dog and the bread and milk),
“Marvel not at this, for rats and mice do more than that.” Thereupon
he said, “Get ye home! In the days of my poverty I was
a liar when I told you of the dogs jumping upon the shelf and
eating the bread and defiling the milk; and to-day, because I am
rich again, I say sooth when I tell you that locusts devoured a
stone one cubit long and one cubit broad.” They were abashed
by his speech and departed from him; and the youth’s good prospered
and his case was amended. “Nor” (continued the Wazir),
“is this stranger or more seld-seen than the story of the Prince
who fell in love with the Picture.” Quoth the king, Shah Bakht,
“Haply, an I hear this story, I shall gain wisdom from it: so I
will not hasten in the slaying of this Minister, nor will I do him
die before the thirty days have expired.” Then he gave him
leave to withdraw, and he hied away to his own house.</p>

    <div>The Sixth Night of the Month.</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the day absconded and the evening arrived, the king sat
private in his chamber and, summoning the Wazir, who presented
himself to him, questioned him of the story. So the Minister
said, “Hear, O auspicious king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE PRINCE WHO FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PICTURE</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, in a province of Persia, a king of the kings, who
was great of degree, a magnifico, endowed with majesty and
girt by soldiery; but he was childless. Towards the end of his
life, his Lord vouchsafed him a male-child, and that boy grew up
and was comely and learned all manner of lere. He made him a
private place, which was a towering palace, edified with coloured
marbles and jewels and paintings. When the Prince entered the
palace, he saw in its ceiling the picture of a maiden, than whom he
had never beheld a fairer of aspect, and she was surrounded by
slave-girls; whereupon he fell down in a fainting fit and became
distracted for love of her. Then he sat under the picture till his
father came in to him one day, and finding him lean of limb and
changed of complexion (which was by reason of his continual
looking on that picture), imagined that he was ill and summoned
the sages and the leaches, that they might medicine him. He also
said to one of his cup-companions, “An thou canst learn what
aileth my son, thou shalt have of me the white hand.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5421" id="noteref-5421" epub:type="noteref">5421</a> Thereupon
he went in to him and spake him fair and cajoled him, till
he confessed to him that his malady was caused by the picture.
Then the courtier returned to the king and told him what ailed
his son, whereupon he transported the Prince to another palace
and made his former lodging the guest-house; and whoso of the
Arabs was entertained therein, him he questioned of the picture,
but none could give him tidings thereof, till one day, when there
came a wayfarer who seeing the picture, cried, “There is no
god but <i>the</i> God! My brother painted this portrait.” So the king
sent for him and questioned him of the affair of the picture and
where was he who had painted it. He replied, “O my lord, we
are two brothers and one of us went to the land of Hind and fell
in love with the Indian king’s daughter, and ’tis she who is the
original of the portrait. He is wont in every city he entereth to
limn her likeness, and I follow him, and longsome is my way.”
When the king’s son heard this, he said, “Needs must I travel to
this damsel.” So he took all manner rare store and riches galore
and journeyed days and nights till he entered the land of Hind,
nor did he reach it save after sore travail. Then he asked of the
King of Hind who also heard of him, and invited him to the
palace. When the Prince came before him, he sought of him his
daughter in marriage, and the king said, “Indeed, thou art her
match, but there is one objection, to wit, none dare name a male
before her because of her hate for men.” So he pitched his tents
under her palace windows, till one day of the days he gat hold of
a girl, one of her favourite slave-girls, and gave her a mint of
money. Quoth she to him, “Hast thou a need?” and quoth he,
“Yes,” and presently acquainted her with his case; when she said,
“In very sooth, thou puttest thyself in peril.” Then he tarried,
flattering himself with false hopes, till all that he had with him
was gone and the servants fled from him; whereupon he said to
one in whom he trusted, “I am minded to repair to my country and
fetch what may suffice me and return hither.” The other answered,
“’Tis for thee to judge.” So they set out to return, but
the way was long to them and all that the Prince had with him
was spent and his company died and there abode but one with him
whom he loaded with the little that remained of the victual and
they left the rest and fared on. Then there came out a lion and
devoured the servant, and the king’s son found himself alone. He
went on, till his hackney stood still, whereupon he left it and walked
till his feet swelled. Presently he came to the land of the Turks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5422" id="noteref-5422" epub:type="noteref">5422</a>
and he naked, hungry, nor having with him aught but somewhat
of jewels, bound about his fore-arm.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5423" id="noteref-5423" epub:type="noteref">5423</a> So he went to the bazar of
the goldsmiths and calling one of the brokers gave him the gems.
The broker looked and seeing two great rubies, said to him,
“Follow me.” Accordingly, he followed him, till he brought
him to a goldsmith, to whom he gave the jewels, saying, “Buy
these.” He asked, “Whence hadst thou these?” and the
broker answered, “This youth is the owner of them.” Then
said the goldsmith to the Prince, “Whence hadst thou these
rubies?” and he told him all that had befallen him and that he
was a king’s son. The goldsmith sat astounded at his adventures
and bought of him the rubies for a thousand gold pieces. Then
said the Prince to him, “Equip thyself to go with me to my
country.” So he made ready and went with him till the king’s
son drew near the frontiers of his sire’s kingdom, where the people
received him with most honourable reception and sent to acquaint
his father with his son’s arrival. The king came out to meet him
and they entreated the goldsmith with respect and regard. The
Prince abode awhile with his sire, then set out, he and the goldsmith,
to return to the country of the fair one, the daughter of the
king of Hind; but there met him highwaymen by the way and he
fought the sorest of fights and was slain. The goldsmith buried
him and set a mark<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5424" id="noteref-5424" epub:type="noteref">5424</a> on his grave and returned to his own country
sorrowing and distraught, without telling any of the Prince’s
violent death. Such was the case of the king’s son and the goldsmith;
but as regards the Indian king’s daughter of whom the
Prince went in quest and on whose account he was slain, she had
been wont to look out from the topmost terrace of her palace and
to gaze on the youth and on his beauty and loveliness; so she said
to her slave-girl one day, “Out on thee! What is become of the
troops which were camped beside my palace?” The maid replied,
“They were the troops of the youth, son to the Persian king, who
came to demand thee in wedlock, and wearied himself on thine
account, but thou hadst no ruth on him.” Cried the Princess,
“Woe to thee! Why didst thou not tell me?” and the damsel
replied, “I feared thy fury.” Then she sought an audience of the
king her sire and said to him, “By Allah, I will go in quest of
him, even as he came in quest of me; else should I not do him
justice as due.” So she equipped herself and setting out, traversed
the wastes and spent treasures till she came to Sistan, where she
called a goldsmith to make her somewhat of ornaments. Now as
soon as the goldsmith saw her, he knew her (for that the Prince had
talked with him of her and had depictured her to him), so he
questioned her of her case, and she acquainted him with her errand,
whereupon he buffeted his face and rent his raiment and hove
dust on his head and fell a-weeping. Quoth she, “Why dost
thou all this?” And he acquainted her with the Prince’s case
and how he was his comrade and told her that he was dead;
whereat she grieved for him and faring on to his father and mother,
acquainted them with the case. Thereupon the Prince’s father
and his uncle and his mother and the lords of the land repaired to
his grave and the Princess made mourning over him, crying aloud.
She abode by the tomb a whole month; then she caused fetch
painters and bade them limn her likeness and the portraiture
of the king’s son. She also set down in writing their story and
that which had befallen them of perils and afflictions and placed
it, together with the pictures, at the head of the grave; and after
a little, they departed from the spot. “Nor” (continued the
Wazir), “is this stranger, O king of the age, than the story of the
Fuller and his Wife and the Trooper and what passed between
them.” With this the king bade the Minister hie away to his
lodging, and when he arose in the morning, he abode his day in
his house.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">At eventide the king sat in his wonted seat and sending
for the Wazir, said to him, “Tell me the story of the Fuller and
his Wife.” The Minister replied, “With joy and goodly gree!”
So he came forward and said, “Hear, O king of the age,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE FULLER AND HIS WIFE AND THE TROOPER</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5425" id="noteref-5425" epub:type="noteref">5425</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once in a city of the cities a woman fair of favour,
who took to lover a trooper wight. Her husband was a fuller, and
when he went out to his work, the trooper used to come to her
and tarry with her till the time of the fuller’s return, when he would
go away. After this fashion they abode awhile, till one day the
trooper said to his mistress, “I mean to take me a tenement close
to thine and dig a Sardáb-souterrain from my house to thy house,
and do thou say to thy spouse:—My sister hath been absent with
her husband and now they have returned from their travels; and
I have made her home herself in my neighbourhood, in order that
I may foregather with her at all times. So go thou to her mate
the trooper and offer him thy wares for sale, and thou wilt see
my sister with him and wilt see that she is I and I am she, without
a doubt. Now, Allah, Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5426" id="noteref-5426" epub:type="noteref">5426</a> go to my sister’s husband and give
ear to that which he shall say to thee.” So the trooper bought
him a house near hand and made therein a tunnel abutting upon
his mistress’s house. When he had accomplished his affair, the
wife bespoke her husband as her lover had lessoned her and he
went out to go to the trooper’s house, but turned back by the way,
whereupon said she to him, “By Allah, go at once, for my sister
asketh of thee.” The fool of a fuller went out and made for the
trooper’s house, whilst his wife forewent him thither by the underground
passage, and going up, sat down beside the soldier her leman.
Presently, the fuller entered and saluted the trooper and salamed
to his own wife and was confounded at the coincidence of the
case.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5427" id="noteref-5427" epub:type="noteref">5427</a> Then, doubt befalling him, he returned in haste to his
dwelling; but she preceded him by the Sardab to her chamber
and donning her wonted clothes, sat awaiting him and said to him,
“Did I not bid thee go to my sister and greet her husband and
make friends with them?” Quoth he, “I did this, but I misdoubted
of my affair, when I saw his wife;” and quoth she, “Did I
not tell thee that she favoureth me and I her, and there is naught
to distinguish between us but our clothes? Go back to her and
make sure.” Accordingly, of the heaviness of his wit, he believed
her, and returning on his way, went in to the trooper; but she
had foregone him, and when he saw her by the side of her lover,
he began looking on her and pondering. Then he saluted her
and she returned him the salam; and when she spoke he was
clean bewildered. So the trooper asked him, “What aileth thee
to be thus?” and he answered, “This woman is my wife, and the
speech is her speech.” Then he rose in haste and, returning to
his own house, saw his wife, who had preceded him by the secret
passage. So he went back to the trooper’s house and found her
sitting as before; whereupon he was abashed in her presence and
seating himself in the trooper’s sitting-chamber, ate and drank with
him and became drunken and abode senseless all that day till
nightfall, when the trooper arose and, the fuller’s hair being long
and flowing, he shaved off a portion of it after the fashion of the
Turks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5428" id="noteref-5428" epub:type="noteref">5428</a> clipped the rest short and clapped a Tarbúsh on his
head. Then he thrust his feet into walking-boots and girt him with
a sword and a girdle and bound about his middle a quiver and a
bow and arrows. He also put some silvers in his poke and thrust
into his sleeve letters-patent addressed to the governor of Ispahan,
bidding him assign to Rustam Khamártakani a monthly allowance
of an hundred dirhams and ten pounds of bread and five pounds
of meat and enrol him among the Turks under his commandment.
After which he took him up and carrying him forth, left him in
one of the mosques. The fuller ceased not sleeping till sunrise,
when he awoke and finding himself in this plight, misdoubted of
his affair and fancied that he was a Turk and fell a-putting one
foot forward and drawing the other back. Then said he in himself,
“I will go to my dwelling, and if my wife know me, then am
I Ahmad the fuller; but an she know me not, I am a Turk.” So
he betook himself to his house; but when his wife, the cunning
witch, saw him, she cried out in his face, saying, “Whither now,
O trooper? Wilt thou break into the house of Ahmad the fuller,
and he a man of repute, having a brother-in-law a Turk, a man of
rank with the Sultan? An thou depart not, I will acquaint my
husband and he will requite thee thy deed.” When he heard her
words, the dregs of his drink wobbled in his brain and he fancied
that he was indeed a Turk. So he went out from her and putting
his hand to his sleeve, found therein a writ and gave it to one who
read it to him. When he heard that which was in the scroll, his
mind was confirmed in his phantasy; but he said to himself,
“My wife may be seeking to put a cheat on me; so I will go to
my fellows the fullers; and if they recognise me not, then am I
for sure Khamartakani the Turk.” So he betook himself to the
fullers and when they espied him afar off, they thought that he was
really Khamartakani or one of the Turks, who used to send their
washing to them without payment and give them never a stiver.
Now they had complained of them aforetime to the Sultan, and
he said, “If any one of the Turks come to you, pelt him with
stones.” Accordingly, when they saw the fuller, they fell upon him
with sticks and stones and pelted him; whereupon quoth he,
“Verily, I am a Turk and knew it not.” Then he took of the
dirhams in his pouch and bought him victual for the way and hired
a hackney and set out for Ispahan, leaving his wife to the trooper.
“Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this stranger than the story of the
Merchant and the Crone and the King.” The Minister’s tale pleased
King Shah Bakht and his heart clave to the story of the merchant
and the old woman; so he bade Al-Rahwan withdraw to his
lodging, and he went away to his house and abode there the next
day till he should be summoned to the presence.</p>

    <div>The Eighth Night of the Month.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the king sat private in his chamber
and bade fetch the Wazir, who presented himself before him, and
the king required of him the story. So the Wazir answered
“With love and gladness. Hear, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE MERCHANT, THE CRONE, AND THE KING</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a family of affluence and distinction, in a city
of Khorasan, and the townsfolk used to envy them for that which
Allah had vouchsafed them. As time went on, their fortune
ceased from them and they passed away, till there remained of
them but one old woman. When she grew feeble and decrepit,
the townsfolk succoured her not with aught, but thrust her forth
of the city, saying, “This old woman shall not neighbour with
us, for that we do good to her and she requiteth us with evil.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5429" id="noteref-5429" epub:type="noteref">5429</a>
So she took shelter in a ruined place and strangers used to bestow
alms upon her, and in this way she tarried a length of time.
Now the king of that city had aforetime contended for the kingship
with his uncle’s son, and the people disliked the king; but
Allah Almighty decreed that he should overcome his cousin.
However, jealousy of him abode in his heart and he acquainted
the Wazir, who hid it not and sent him money. Furthermore, he
fell to summoning all strangers who came to the town, man after
man, and questioning them of their creed and their goods, and
whoso answered him not satisfactory, he took his wealth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5430" id="noteref-5430" epub:type="noteref">5430</a> Now a
certain wealthy man of the Moslems was wayfaring, without knowing
aught of this, and it befel that he arrived at that city by night,
and coming to the ruin, gave the old woman money and said to
her, “No harm upon thee.” Whereupon she lifted up her voice
and blessed him: so he set down his merchandise by her and
abode with her the rest of the night and the next day. Now
highwaymen had followed him that they might rob him of his
monies, but succeeded not in aught: wherefore he went up to the
old woman and kissed her head and exceeded in bounty to her.
Then she warned him of that which awaited strangers entering the
town and said to him, “I like not this for thee and I fear mischief
for thee from these questions that the Wazir hath appointed for
addressing the ignorant.” And she expounded to him the case
according to its conditions: then said she to him, “But have thou
no concern: only carry me with thee to thy lodging, and if he question
thee of aught enigmatical, whilst I am with thee, I will
expound the answers to thee.” So he carried the crone with him
to the city and lodged her in his lodging and entreated her
honourably. Presently, the Wazir heard of the merchant’s
coming; so he sent to him and bade bring him to his house and
talked with him awhile of his travels and of whatso had befallen
him therein, and the merchant answered his queries. Then said the
Minister, “I will put certain critical questions to thee, which an thou
answer me, ’twill be well for thee,” and the merchant rose and
made him no answer. Quoth the Wazir, “What is the weight of
the elephant?” The merchant was perplexed and returned him
no reply, giving himself up for lost; however, at last he said,
“Grant me three days of delay.” The minister granted him
the time he sought and he returned to his lodging and related
what had passed to the old woman, who said, “When the morrow
cometh, go to the Wazir and say to him, Make a ship and launch
it on the sea and put in it an elephant, and when it sinketh in the
water, mark the place whereunto the water riseth. Then take out
the elephant and cast in stones in its place, till the ship sink to
that same mark; whereupon do thou take out the stones and
weigh them and thou wilt presently know the weight of the
elephant.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5431" id="noteref-5431" epub:type="noteref">5431</a> Accordingly, when he arose in the morning, he went
to the Wazir and repeated to him that which the old woman had
taught him; whereat the Minister marvelled and said to him,
“What sayest thou of a man, who seeth in his house four holes,
and in each hole a viper offering to sally out upon him and slay
him, and in his house are four sticks and each hole may not be
stopped but with the ends of two sticks? How, then, shall he
stop all the holes and deliver himself from the vipers?” When
the merchant heard this, there befel him such concern that it
garred him forget the first and he said to the Wazir, “Grant me
delay, so I may reflect on the reply”; and the Minister cried, “Go
out, and bring me the answer, or I will seize thy monies.” The
merchant fared forth and returned to the old woman who, seeing
him changed of complexion, said to him, “What did his hoariness
ask thee?” So he acquainted her with the case and she cried,
“Fear not; I will bring thee forth of this strait.” Quoth he, “Allah
requite thee with weal!” Then quoth she, “To-morrow go to
him with a stout heart and say:—The answer to that whereof thou
asketh me is this. Put the heads of two sticks into one of the
holes; then take the other two sticks and lay them across the
middle of the first two and stop with their two heads the second
hole and with their ferrules the fourth hole. Then take the ferrules
of the first two sticks and stop with them the third hole.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5432" id="noteref-5432" epub:type="noteref">5432</a>
So he repaired to the Wazir and repeated to him the answer; and
he marvelled at its justness and said to him, “Go; by Allah; I
will ask thee no more questions, for thou with thy skill marrest
my foundation.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5433" id="noteref-5433" epub:type="noteref">5433</a> Then he treated him as a friend and the
merchant acquainted him with the affair of the old woman;
whereupon quoth the Wazir, “Needs must the intelligent company
with the intelligent.” Thus did this weak woman restore to that
man his life and his monies on the easiest wise; “Nor,” continued
the Wazir, “is this stranger than the story of the Simpleton
Husband.” When the king heard this, he said, “How like it must
be to this our own case!” Then he bade the Minister retire to
his lodging; so he withdrew and on the morrow he abode at home
till the king should summon him to his presence.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the night came, the king sat private in his chamber and
sending after the Wazir, sought of him the story; and he said,
“Hear, O august king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE SIMPLETON HUSBAND</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5434" id="noteref-5434" epub:type="noteref">5434</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once in olden time a foolish man and an ignorant,
who had abounding wealth, and his wife was a beautiful woman,
who loved a handsome youth. The Cicisbeo used to watch for
her husband’s absence and come to her, and on this wise he abode
a long while. One day of the days, as the woman was closeted
with her lover, he said to her, “O my lady and my beloved, an
thou desire me and love me, give me possession of thy person and
satisfy my need in the presence of thy husband; otherwise I will
never again come to thee nor draw near thee while I live my life.”
Now she loved him with exceeding love and could not suffer his separation
an hour nor could endure to anger him; so, when she heard
his words, she said to him, “Bismillah, so be it, in Allah’s name,
O my darling and coolth of mine eyes: may he not live who would
vex thee!” Quoth he, “To-day?” and quoth she, “Yes, by thy
life,” and made an appointment with him for this. When her husband
came home, she said to him, “I want to go a-pleasuring,”
and he said, “With all my heart.” So he went, till he came to
a goodly place, abounding in vines and water, whither he carried
her and pitched her a tent by the side of a tall tree; and she
betook herself to a place alongside the tent and made her there
a Sardáb, in which she hid her lover. Then said she to her
husband, “I want to climb this tree<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5435" id="noteref-5435" epub:type="noteref">5435</a>”; and he said, “Do so.”
So she clomb it and when she came to the tree-top, she cried out
and slapped her face, saying, “O thou lecher, are these thy lewd
ways? Thou swarest faith to me, and thou liedest.” And she
repeated her speech twice and thrice. Then she came down
from the tree and rent her raiment and said, “O lecher, an
these be thy dealings with me before my eyes, how dost thou
when thou art absent from me?” Quoth he, “What aileth thee?”
and quoth she, “I saw thee futter the woman before my very
eyes.” Cried he, “Not so, by Allah! But hold thy peace till I
go up and see.” So he clomb the tree and no sooner did he
begin to do so than out came the lover from his hiding-place and
taking the woman by the legs, fell to shagging her. When the
husband came to the top of the tree, he looked and beheld a
man futtering his wife; so he called out, “O whore, what doings
are these?” and he made haste to come down from the tree to
the ground. But meanwhile the lover had returned to his hiding-place
and his wife asked him, “What sawest thou?” and he
answered, “I saw a man shag thee;” but she said, “Thou liest;
thou sawest naught and sayst this only by way of phantasy.”
The same they did three several times, and every time he clomb
the tree the lover came up out of the underground place and
mounted her, whilst her husband looked on and she still said,
“Seest thou aught, O liar?” “Yes,” would he answer, and came
down in haste, but saw no one and she said to him, “By my life,
look and speak naught but sooth!” Then he cried to her,
“Arise, let us depart this place, for ’tis full of Jinn and Marids.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5436" id="noteref-5436" epub:type="noteref">5436</a>
Accordingly, they returned to their house and nighted there, and
the man arose in the morning, assured that this was all but phantasy
and fascination. And so the lover won his wicked will.
“Nor, O king of the age,” continued the Wazir, “is this stranger
than the story of the King and the Tither.” When the king
heard this from the Minister, he bade him go away, and he
went.</p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">When it was eventide, the king summoned the Wazir and
sought of him the story of the King and the Tither, and he said,
“Hear, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE UNJUST KING AND THE TITHER</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a king of the kings of the earth, who dwelt in
a flourishing city, abounding in good; but he wronged its people
and entreated them foully, so that he ruined the city; and he was
named naught else but tyrant and oppressor. Now he was wont,
wheneas he heard of a violent man in another land, to send after
him and lure him with lucre to take service with him; and there
was a certain Tither, who exceeded all other Tithers in oppression
of the people and foul dealing. So the king sent after him and
when he stood before him, he found him a man of mighty fine
presence and said to him, “Thou hast been described to me, but
I see thou surpassest the description. Set out to me some of
thy doings and sayings, so I may be dispensed therewith from
enquiring into the whole of thy case.” Answered the other, “With
all my heart! Know, O King, that I oppress the folk and people
the land, whilst other than I ruineth it and peopleth it not.” Now
the king was leaning back: but presently he sat upright and said,
“Tell me of this.” The Tither replied, “’Tis well: I go to the man
whom I purpose to tithe and cozen him and feign to be busied with
certain business, so that I seclude myself therewith from the people;
and meanwhile the man is squeezed with the foulest of extortion, till
naught of money is left him. Then I appear and they come in to
me and questions arise concerning him and I say:—Indeed, I was
ordered worse than this, for some one (may Allah curse him!) hath
slandered him to the king. Presently I take half of his good
and return him the rest publicly before the folk and dismiss him to
his house, in all honour and worship, and he garreth the money
returned be carried before him, whilst he blesseth me and all who
are with him also bless me. So is it bruited abroad in the city
that I have restored to him his monies and he himself notifieth the
like, to the intent that he may have a claim on me for the
favour due to those who praise me. On this wise I keep half his
property. Then I seem to forget him till the year<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5437" id="noteref-5437" epub:type="noteref">5437</a> hath passed
over him, when I send for him and recall to him somewhat of that
which hath befallen aforetime and require of him somewhat of
money in secret; accordingly he doth this and hasteneth to his
house and forwardeth whatso I bid him, with a contented heart.
Then I send to another man, between whom and the first is enmity,
and lay hands upon him and feign to the other man that it is he
who hath slandered him to the king and hath taken the half of his
good; and the people praise me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5438" id="noteref-5438" epub:type="noteref">5438</a> The King wondered at this
and at his wily dealing and clever contrivance and made him controller
of all his affairs and of his kingdom and the land was placed
under his governance, and he said to him, “Take and people.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5439" id="noteref-5439" epub:type="noteref">5439</a>
One day, the Tither went out and saw an old man, a woodcutter,
and with him wood; so he said to him, “Pay a dirham tithe for thy
load.” Quoth the Shaykh, “Behold, thou killest me and killest my
family;” and quoth the Tither, “What? Who killeth the folk?”
And the oldster answered, “An thou let me enter the city, I shall
there sell the load for three dirhams, whereof I will give thee one
and buy with the other two silvers what will support my family;
but, an thou press me for the tithe outside the city, the load will
sell but for one dirham and thou wilt take it and I shall abide
without food, I and my family. Indeed, thou and I in this
circumstance are like unto David and Solomon (on the twain be
the Peace!”) “How so?” asked the Tither, and the woodcutter
answered, “Do thou hear</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF DAVID AND SOLOMON</i>.”</h4>

<p class="c013">Certain husbandmen once made complaint to David (on whom
be the Peace!) against some sheep-owners, whose flocks had come
down upon their crops by night and had devoured them, and he
bade value the crops and that the shepherds should make good
the damage. But Solomon (on whom be the Peace!) rose and
said, “Nay, but let the sheep be delivered to the husbandmen, so
they may take their milk and wool, till they have recouped the
value of their crops; then let the sheep return to their owners.”
Accordingly David reversed his own decision and caused execute
that of Solomon; yet was David no oppressor; but Solomon’s
judgment was the juster and he showed himself therein better
versed in jurisprudence and Holy Law.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5440" id="noteref-5440" epub:type="noteref">5440</a> When the Tither heard
the old man’s speech, he felt ruthful and said to him, “O Shaykh,
I make thee a gift of that which is due from thee, and do thou
cleave to me and leave me not, so haply I may get of thee gain
which shall do away from me my wrongousness and guide me on
the path of righteousness.” So the old man followed him, and
there met him another with a load of wood. Quoth the Tither
to him, “Pay me that which thou owest me;” and quoth he,
“Have patience with me till to-morrow, for I owe the hire of a
house, and I will sell another load of fuel and pay thee two days’
tithe.” But he refused him this and the Shaykh said to him,
“An thou constrain him unto this, thou wilt compel him quit thy
country, because he is a stranger here and hath no domicile; and
if he remove on account of one dirham, thou wilt forfeit of him
three hundred and sixty dirhams a year.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5441" id="noteref-5441" epub:type="noteref">5441</a> Thus wilt thou lose the
mickle in keeping the little.” Quoth the Tither, “Verily<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5442" id="noteref-5442" epub:type="noteref">5442</a> will I
give him a dirham every month to the rent of his lodging.” Then
he went on and presently there met him a third woodcutter and
he said to him, “Pay thy due;” but he said, “I will pay thee a
dirham, when I enter the city; or take of me four dániks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5443" id="noteref-5443" epub:type="noteref">5443</a> now.”
Quoth the Tither, “I will not do it,” but the Shaykh said to him,
“Take of him the four daniks presently, for ’tis easy to take and
hard to give back.” Exclaimed the Tither, “By Allah ’tis
good!” and he arose and hied on, crying out at the top of his
voice and saying, “I have no power this day to do evil.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5444" id="noteref-5444" epub:type="noteref">5444</a> Then
he doffed his dress and went forth wandering at a venture,
repenting unto his Lord. “Nor” (continued the Wazir), “is this
story stranger than that of the Robber who believed the Woman
and sought refuge with Allah against falling in with her like, by
reason of her cunning contrivance for herself.” When the king
heard this, he said to himself, “Since the Tither repented, in
consequence of the woodcutter’s warnings, it behoveth I leave this
Wazir on life so I may hear the story of the Robber and the
Woman.” And he bade Al-Rahwan return to his lodging.</p>

    <div>The Eleventh Night of the Month.</div>

</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the evening came and the king had taken his seat, he
summoned the Wazir and required of him the story of the Robber
and the Woman. Quoth the Minister, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE ROBBER AND THE WOMAN</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">A certain Robber was a cunning workman and used not to steal
aught, till he had wasted all that was with him; moreover, he
stole not from his neighbours, neither companied with any of
the thieves, for fear lest some one should betray him, and his case
become public. After this fashion he abode a great while, in
flourishing condition, and his secret was concealed, till Almighty
Allah decreed that he broke in upon a beggar, a poor man whom
he deemed rich. When he gained access to the house, he found
naught, whereat he was wroth, and necessity prompted him to
wake that man, who lay asleep alongside of his wife. So he
aroused him and said to him, “Show me thy treasure.” Now he
had no treasure to show; but the Robber believed him not and was
instant upon him with threats and blows. When he saw that he
got no profit of him, he said to him, “Swear by the oath of
divorce<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5445" id="noteref-5445" epub:type="noteref">5445</a> from thy wife that thou hast nothing.” So he sware and
his wife said to him, “Fie on thee! Wilt thou divorce me? Is
not the hoard buried in yonder chamber?” Then she turned to
the Robber and conjured him to be weightier of blows upon her
husband, till he should deliver to him the treasure, anent which
he had forsworn himself. So he drubbed him with a grievous
drubbing, till he carried him to a certain chamber, wherein she
signed to him that the hoard was and that he should take it up.
So the Robber entered, he and the husband; and when they were
both in the chamber, she locked on them the door, which was a
stout and strong, and said to the Robber, “Woe to thee, O fool!
Thou hast fallen into the trap and now I have but to cry out
and the officers of police will come and take thee and thou wilt
lose thy life, O Satan!” Quoth he, “Let me go forth;” and
quoth she, “Thou art a man and I am a woman; and in thy hand
is a knife, and I am afraid of thee.” He cried, “Take the knife
from me.” So she took it and said to her husband, “Art thou a
woman and he a man? Pain his neck-nape with tunding, even as
he tunded thee; and if he put out his hand to thee, I will cry out
a single cry and the policemen will come and take him and hew
him in two.” So the husband said to him, “O thousand-horned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5446" id="noteref-5446" epub:type="noteref">5446</a>
O dog, O dodger, I owe thee a deposit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5447" id="noteref-5447" epub:type="noteref">5447</a> wherefor thou hast dunned
me.” And he fell to bashing him grievously with a stick of
holm-oak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5448" id="noteref-5448" epub:type="noteref">5448</a> whilst he called out to the woman for help and prayed
her to deliver him: but she said, “Keep thy place till the morning,
and thou shalt see queer things.” And her husband beat him
within the chamber, till he killed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5449" id="noteref-5449" epub:type="noteref">5449</a> him and he swooned away.
Then he left beating him and when the Robber came to himself,
the woman said to her husband, “O man, this house is on hire
and we owe its owners much money, and we have naught; so
how wilt thou do?” And she went on to bespeak him thus.
The Robber asked “And what is the amount of the rent?” The
husband answered, “’Twill be eighty dirhams;” and the thief said,
“I will pay this for thee and do thou let me go my way.” Then
the wife enquired, “O man, how much do we owe the baker and
the greengrocer?” Quoth the Robber, “What is the sum of this?”
And the husband said, “Sixty dirhams.” Rejoined the other, “That
makes two hundred dirhams; let me go my way and I will pay
them.” But the wife said, “O my dear, and the girl groweth up
and needs must we marry her and equip her and do what else is
needful.” So the Robber said to the husband, “How much dost
thou want?” and he rejoined, “An hundred dirhams in a
modest way.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5450" id="noteref-5450" epub:type="noteref">5450</a> Quoth the Robber, “That maketh three hundred
dirhams.” Then the woman said, “O my dear, when the girl is
married, thou wilt need money for winter expenses, charcoal and
firewood and other necessaries.” The Robber asked, “What wouldst
thou have?” And she answered, “An hundred dirhams.” He
rejoined, “Be it four hundred dirhams.” And she continued, “O
my dear and O coolth of mine eyes, needs must my husband
have capital in hand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5451" id="noteref-5451" epub:type="noteref">5451</a> wherewith he may buy goods and open
him a shop.” Said he, “How much will that be?” And she,
“An hundred dirhams.” Quoth the Robber, “That maketh five
hundred dirhams; I will pay it; but may I be triply divorced
from my wife if all my possessions amount to more than this, and
they be the savings of twenty years! Let me go my way, so I
may deliver them to thee.” Cried she, “O fool, how shall I let
thee go thy way? Utterly impossible! Be pleased to give me a
right token.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5452" id="noteref-5452" epub:type="noteref">5452</a> So he gave her a token for his wife and she cried
out to her young daughter and said to her, “Keep this door.”
Then she charged her husband to watch over the Robber, till she
should return, and repairing to his wife, acquainted her with his
case and told her that her husband the thief had been taken and
had compounded for his release, at the price of seven hundred
dirhams, and named to her the token. Accordingly, she gave her
the money and she took it and returned to her house. By this
time, the dawn had dawned; so she let the thief go his way, and
when he went out, she said to him, “O my dear, when shall I see
thee come and take the treasure?” And he, “O indebted one,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5453" id="noteref-5453" epub:type="noteref">5453</a>
when thou needest other seven hundred dirhams, wherewith to
amend thy case and that of thy children and to pay thy debts.”
And he went out, hardly believing in his deliverance from her.
“Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this stranger than the story of
the Three Men and our Lord Ísà.” So the king bade him hie to
his own home.</p>

<p class="c000">When it was eventide, the king summoned the Minister and bade
him tell the promised tale. He replied, “Hearing and obeying.
Give ear, O glorious king, to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE THREE MEN AND OUR LORD ISA</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">Three men once went out questing treasure and came upon a
nugget of gold, weighing fifty maunds.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5454" id="noteref-5454" epub:type="noteref">5454</a> When they saw it, they
took it up on their shoulders and carried it till they drew near a
certain city, when one of them said, “Let us sit in the cathedral-mosque,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5455" id="noteref-5455" epub:type="noteref">5455</a>
whilst one of us shall go and buy us what we may eat.”
So they sat down in the mosque and one of them arose and entered
the city. When he came therein, his soul prompted<a id="t250"></a> him to false
his two fellows and get the gold to himself alone. Accordingly,
he bought food and poisoned it: but, when he returned to his
comrades, they sprang upon him and slew him, in order that they
might enjoy the gold without him. Then they ate of the poisoned
food and died, and the gold lay cast down over against them.
Presently, Ísà bin Maryam (on whom be the Peace!) passed
by and seeing this, besought Allah Almighty for tidings of their
case; so He told him what had betided them, whereat great was
his surprise and he related to his disciples<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5456" id="noteref-5456" epub:type="noteref">5456</a> what he had seen.
Quoth one of them, “O Spirit of Allah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5457" id="noteref-5457" epub:type="noteref">5457</a> naught resembleth this
but my own adventure.” Quoth Isa, “How so?” and the other
began to tell</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE DISCIPLE’S STORY</i>.</h4>

<p class="c013">Once I was in such a city, where I hid a thousand dirhams in a
monastery. After a while, I went thither and taking the money,
bound it about my waist. Then I set out to return and when I
came to the Sahará<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5458" id="noteref-5458" epub:type="noteref">5458</a>-waste, the carrying of the money was heavy
upon me. Presently, I espied a horseman pushing on after me;
so I waited till he came up and said to him, “O rider, carry this
money for me and earn reward and recompense in Heaven.” Said
he, “No, I will not do it, for I should tire myself and tire out my
horse.” Then he went on but, before he had gone far, he said in
his mind, “An I take up the money and put my steed to speed
and devance him, how shall he overtake me?” And I also said in my
mind, “Verily, I erred; for, had he taken the money and made off,
what could I have done?” Then he turned back to me and cried
to me, “Hand over the money, that I may carry it for thee.” But
I replied to him, “That which hath occurred to thy mind hath occurred
to mine also; so go thou and go safe.” Quoth Isa (on whom
be the Peace!), “Had these done prudently, they had taken thought
for themselves; but they unheeded the issues of events; for that
whoso acteth cautiously is safe and winneth his wish, and whoso
neglecteth precaution is lost and repenteth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5459" id="noteref-5459" epub:type="noteref">5459</a> “Nor,” continued
the Wazir, “is this stranger or rarer than the story of the King,
whose kingdom was restored to him and his wealth, after he had
become poor, possessing not a single dirham.” When the king
heard this, he said in himself, “How like is this to my own story
in the matter of the Minister and his slaughter! Had I not used
deliberation, I had done him dead.” And he bade Al-Rahwan
hie to his own home.</p>

<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Thirteenth Night of the Month.</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the king sent for the Wazir to his
sitting chamber and bade him tell the promised tale. So he said,
“Hearkening and obedience. They relate, O king,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE DETHRONED RULER WHOSE REIGN AND WEALTH WERE RESTORED TO HIM</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, in a city of the cities of Al-Hind, a just king
and a beneficent, and he had a Wazir, a man of understanding,
upright in his rede, and praiseworthy in his policy, a Minister
in whose hand was the handling of all the affairs of the realm; for
he was firmly based on the Sultan’s favour and high in esteem
with the folk of his time, and the king set great store by him and
entrusted himself to him in all his transactions, by reason of his
excellent management of the lieges, and he had guards<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5460" id="noteref-5460" epub:type="noteref">5460</a> who were
content with him and grateful to him. Now that king had a
brother, who envied him and would lief have taken his place;
and when he was a-weary of looking for his death and the term of
his life seemed distant, he took counsel with certain of his partisans
and they said, “The Minister is the monarch’s counsellor
and but for this Wazir the king were kingdomless.” So the
pretender cast about for the ruin of the defender, but could find no
means of furthering his design; and when the affair grew longsome
upon him, he said to his wife, “What deemest thou will
gar us gain herein?” “What is it?” “I mean in the matter of
yonder Minister, who inciteth my brother to worship with all his
might and biddeth him unto devoutness, and indeed the king doteth
upon his counsel and stablisheth him governor of all monies and
matters.” “True; but how shall we devise with him?” “I
have a device, so thou wilt help me in that which I shall say to
thee.” “Thou shalt have my help in whatsoever thou desirest.”
“I mean to dig him a pit in the vestibule and conceal it artfully.”
Accordingly, he did this, and when it was night, he covered the
pit with a light covering, so that, when the Wazir trod upon it, it
would give way under his tread. Then he sent to him and summoned
him to the Court in the king’s name, and the messenger
bade him enter by the private wicket-way. So he came in alone,
and when he stepped upon the covering of the pit, it caved in
with him and he fell to the bottom; whereupon the king’s brother
fell to pelting him with stones. When the Minister beheld what
had betided him he gave himself up for lost; so he stirred not for
a while and lay still. The Prince, seeing him make no sign
deemed him dead; so he took him forth and wrapping him up in
his robes, cast him into the surges of the sea in the middle night.
When the Wazir felt the water, he awoke from the swoon and
swam for an hour or so, till a ship passed by him, whereupon he
shouted to the sailors and they took him up. Now when the
morning morrowed, the people went seeking for him, but found
him not; and the king learning this, was perplexed concerning
his affair and abode unknowing whatso he should do. Then
he sought for a Minister to stand in his stead, and the king’s
brother said, “I have for Wazir an efficient man.” Said the king,
“Bring him to me.” So he brought him a man, whom he
set at the head of affairs; but he seized upon the kingdom
and threw the king in fetters and made his brother king in lieu
of him. The new ruler gave himself up to all manner of frowardness,
whereat the folk murmured and his Minister said to him,
“I fear lest the Hindians take the old king and restore him to
the kingship and we both come to ruin: so, if we seize him and
cast him into the sea, we shall be at rest from him; and we will
publish among the folk that he is dead.” And they, agreeing
upon this, took him up and carrying him out to sea, cast him
in. When he felt the water, he struck out, and ceased not swimming
till he landed upon an island, where he tarried five days
finding nothing which he might eat or drink; but, on the sixth
day, when he despaired of his life, behold, there passed a ship; so
he made signals to the crew and they came and took him up and
fared on with him to an inhabited country, where they set him
ashore, mother-naked as he was. There, seeing a man seeding, he
sought guidance of him and the husbandman asked, “Art thou a
foreigner?” “Yes,” answered the king and sat with him and they
talked. The peasant found him clever and quick-witted and said
to him, “An thou beheld a comrade of mine, thou wouldst see him
the like of what I see thee, for his case is even as thy case, and he
is at this present my friend.” Quoth the king, “Verily, thou
makest me long to look at him. Canst thou not bring us
together, me and him?” Quoth the husbandman, “With joy and
goodly gree;” and the king sat with him till he had made an end
of his seeding, when he carried him to his homestead and brought
him in company with the other stranger, and behold it was his
Wazir. When each saw other, the twain wept and embraced, and
the sower wept for their weeping; but the king hid their affair and
said to him, “This man is from my mother-land and he is as my
brother.” So they homed with the husbandman and helped
him for a hire, wherewith they supported themselves a long spell.
Meanwhile, they sought news of their patrial stead and learned
that which its people suffered of straitness and severity. One day
there came a ship and in it a merchant from their own country,
who knew them and rejoiced in them with joy exceeding and clad
them in goodly clothing. He also acquainted them with the
manner of the treachery that had been practised upon them,
and counselled them to return to their own land, they and he with
whom they had made friends,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5461" id="noteref-5461" epub:type="noteref">5461</a> assuring them that Almighty Allah
would restore them to their former rank. So the king returned
and the folk joined themselves to him and he fell upon his brother
and his Wazir and took them and threw them into jail. Then he
sat down again upon the throne of his kingship, whilst the Minister
stood between his hands and they returned to their former estate,
but they had naught of worldly wealth. Presently the king said
to his Wazir, “How shall we continue tarrying in this city, and we
thus poorly conditioned?” and he answered, “Be at thine ease
and have no concern.” Then he singled out one of the soldiers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5462" id="noteref-5462" epub:type="noteref">5462</a>
and said to him, “Send us thy service<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5463" id="noteref-5463" epub:type="noteref">5463</a> for the year.” Now there
were in the city fifty thousand subjects<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5464" id="noteref-5464" epub:type="noteref">5464</a> and in the hamlets and
villages<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5465" id="noteref-5465" epub:type="noteref">5465</a> a like number; and the Minister sent to each of these,
saying, “Let each and every of you get an egg and set it under a
hen.” They did this and it was neither burden nor grievance to
them; and when twenty days had passed by, each egg was hatched,
and the Wazir bade them pair the chickens, male with female, and
rear them well. They did accordingly and it was found a charge
unto no one. Then they waited for them awhile and after this the
Minister asked of the chickens and was answered that they were
become fowls. Furthermore, they brought him all their eggs and
he bade set them; and after twenty days there were hatched from
each pair of them thirty or five-and-twenty or fifteen chickens at
the least. The Wazir bade note against each man the number of
chickens which pertained to him, and after two months, he took
the old partlets and the cockerels, and there came to him from each
man some half a score, and he left the young partlets with them.
Even so he sent to the country folk and let the cocks remain with
them. Thus he got him whole broods of young poultry and appropriated
to himself the sale of the fowls, and on this wise he gained
for him, in the course of a year, that which the kingly estate required
of the King, and his affairs were set right for him by the cunning
contrivance of the Minister. And he caused the country to thrive
and dealt justly by his subjects and returned to them all that he
took from them and lived a grateful and prosperous life. Thus
right counsel and prudence are better than wealth, for that understanding
profiteth at all times and seasons. “Nor,” continued the
Wazir, “is this stranger than the story of the Man whose caution
slew him.” When the king heard the Words of his Wazir, he
wondered with the uttermost wonder and bade him retire to his
lodging.</p>

<p class="c000">When the Minister returned to the presence, the King sought
of him the story of the Man whose caution slew him and he
said, “Hear, O auspicious King,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE MAN WHOSE CAUTION SLEW HIM</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a man who was cautious exceedingly concerning
himself, and he set out one day on a journey to a land
abounding in wild beasts. The caravan wherewith he fared came
by night to the gate of a city; but the warders would not open to
them, for there were lions there; so they nighted without the
walls. Now that man, of the excess of his caution, could not
determine a place wherein he should pass the night, for fear of
the wild beasts and reptiles; so he went about seeking an empty
stead wherein he might lie. At last, as there was a ruined
building hard by, he climbed up on to a high wall and ceased
not clambering hither and thither, of the excess of his carefulness,
till his feet betrayed him and he slipped and fell to the bottom
and died, whilst his companions arose in the morning safe and
sound. Now, had he overmastered his wrongous rede and had he
submitted himself to Fate and Fortune, it had been safer and
better for him; but he made light of the folk and belittled their
wit and was not content to take example by them; for his soul
whispered him that he was a man of wits and he fancied that,
an he abode with them, he would perish; so his folly cast him
into perdition. “Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this stranger
than the story of the Man who was lavish of his house and
his provision to one he knew not.” When the King heard this,
he said, “I will not separate myself from the folk and slay my
Minister.” And he bade him hie to his own house.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King bade fetch the Wazir and
required of him the story. So he said, “Hear, O King,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE MAN WHO WAS LAVISH OF HIS HOUSE AND HIS PROVISION TO ONE WHOM HE KNEW NOT</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once an Arab of high rank and noble presence,
a model of magnanimity and exalted generosity, and he had
brethren, with whom he consorted and caroused, and they
were wont to assemble by rotation at one another’s homes.
When it came to his turn, he gat ready in his house all manner
goodly meats and pleasant and dainty drinks and the fairest
flowers and the finest fruits, and he provided all kinds of instruments
of music and store of wondrous dictes and marvellous
stories and pleasant instances and histories and witty anecdotes
and verses and what not else, for there was none among those
with whom he was wont to company but enjoyed this in every
goodly fashion, and the entertainment he had provided contained
all whereof each had need. Then he sallied forth in quest of
his friends, and went round about the city, so he might assemble
them; but found none of them at home. Now in that town was a
man of pleasant conversation and large generosity, a merchant
of condition, young of years and bright of blee, who had come
to that place from his own country with merchandise in great
store and wealth galore. He took up his abode therein and
the town was pleasant to him and he was large in lavishing,
so that he came to the end of all his wealth and there remained
in his hand naught save what was upon him of raiment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5466" id="noteref-5466" epub:type="noteref">5466</a> So
he left the lodging which had homed him in the days of his
prosperity; after he had wasted that which was therein of
furniture, and fell to finding refuge in the houses of the townsfolk
from night to night. One day, as he went wandering about
the streets, he beheld a woman of the uttermost beauty and
loveliness, and what he saw of her charms amazed him and
there happened to him what made him forget his sorry plight.
She accosted him and jested with him and he besought her of
union and intimacy; so she consented to this and said to him,
“Let us go to thy lodging.” Herewith he repented and was
perplexed concerning his procedure and grieved for that which
must escape him of her company by reason of the straitness
of his hand, for that he had not a whit of spending-money. But
he was ashamed to say “No,” after he had sued and wooed her;
wherefore he went on before her, bethinking him how he should
rid himself of her and seeking some excuse which he might put
off on her, and gave not over going from street to street, till he
entered one that had no issue and saw, at the farther end, a
door, whereon was a padlock. Then said he to her, “Do thou
excuse me, for my lad hath locked the door and how shall we
open it?” Said she, “O my lord, the padlock is worth only some
ten dirhams;” and presently she tucked up her sleeves from forearms
as they were crystal and taking a stone, smote the padlock
and broke it; and, opening the door, said to him, “Enter,
O my lord.” Accordingly he went in, committing his affair to
Allah (to whom belong Honour and Glory), and she entered after
him and locked the door from within. They found themselves
in a pleasant house, collecting all good and gladness; and the
young man fared forwards, till he came to the sitting-chamber,
and, behold, it was furnished with the finest of furniture as hath
before been set out.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5467" id="noteref-5467" epub:type="noteref">5467</a> He seated himself and leant upon a cushion,
whilst she put out her hand to her veil and doffed it. Then she
threw off her heavy outer clothes till she was clad in the thinnest
which showed her charms, whereupon the young man embraced
her and kissed her and enjoyed her; after which they washed with
the Ghusl-ablution and returned to their place and he said to her,
“Know that I have little knowledge of what goeth on in my own
house, for that I trust to my servant: so arise thou and see what
the lad hath made ready in the kitchen.” Accordingly, she
arose and going down into the kitchen, saw cooking pots over
the fire, wherein were all manner of dainty viands, and firsts-bread<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5468" id="noteref-5468" epub:type="noteref">5468</a>
and fresh almond cakes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5469" id="noteref-5469" epub:type="noteref">5469</a> So she set bread on a dish and
ladled out what she would from the pots and brought it to him.
They ate and drank and played and made merry a while of the
day; and as they were thus engaged, suddenly up came the
master of the house, with his friends, whom he had brought with
him, that they might converse together, as of wont. He saw the
door opened and knocked a light knock, saying to his company,
“Have patience with me, for some of my family are come to visit
me: wherefore excuse belongeth first to Allah Almighty, and then
to you.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5470" id="noteref-5470" epub:type="noteref">5470</a> So they farewelled him and fared their ways, whilst
he rapped another light rap at the door. When the young man
heard this, he changed colour and the woman said to him,
“Methinks thy lad hath returned.” He answered, “Yes;” and
she arose and opening the door to the master of the house, said to
him, “Where hast thou been? Indeed, thy master is angry with
thee?” and he said, “O my lady, I have not been save about his
business.” Then he girt his waist with a kerchief and entering,
saluted the young merchant, who said to him, “Where hast thou
been?” Quoth he, “I have done thine errands;” and quoth the
youth, “Go and eat and come hither and drink.” So he went away,
as he bade him, and ate; then he washed hands and returning to
the sitting-room, sat down on the carpet and fell to talking with
them; whereupon the young merchant’s heart was heartened and
his breast broadened and he applied himself to pleasure. They
were in all joyance of life and the most abounding pleasance till a
third part of the night was past, when the house-master arose,
and spreading them a bed, invited them to take their rest. So
they lay down and the youth wide awake, pondering their affair
till daybreak, when the woman roused herself from sleep and said
to her companion, “I wish to go.” He farewelled her and she
departed; whereupon the master of the house followed her with a
purse of silver and gave it to her, saying, “Blame not my lord,”
and made his excuse to her for his master. Then he returned to
the youth and said to him, “Arise and come to the Hammam;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5471" id="noteref-5471" epub:type="noteref">5471</a>
and he fell to shampooing his hands and feet, whilst the youth
called down blessings on him and said “O my lord, who art
thou? Methinks there is not in the world the like of thee;
no, nor a pleasanter in thy disposition.” Then each of the twain
acquainted the other with his case and condition and they went to
the bath; after which the master of the house conjured the young
merchant to return with him and summoned his friends. So
they ate and drank and he told them the tale, wherefore they
thanked the house-master and praised him; and their friendship
was complete while the young merchant abode in the town,
till Allah made easy to him a means of travel, whereupon
they farewelled him and he departed; and this is the end of
his tale. “Nor,” continued the Wazir, “O king of the age,
is this stranger than the story of the Richard who lost his
wealth and his wit.” When the king heard the Minister’s story,
it pleased him and he bade him hie to his home.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King sat in his sitting-chamber

Wealthy Man who lost his wealth and his wit. So he said,
“Hear, O King,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE MELANCHOLIST AND THE SHARPER</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5472" id="noteref-5472" epub:type="noteref">5472</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a Richard hight ’Ajlán, the Hasty, who wasted his
wealth, and concern and chagrin gat the mastery of him, so that he
became a Melancholist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5473" id="noteref-5473" epub:type="noteref">5473</a> and lost his wit. There remained with
him of his monies about twenty dinars and he used to beg alms
of the folk, and whatso they gave him in charity he would gather
together and add to the gold pieces that were left him. Now
there was in that town a Sharper, who made his living by roguery,
and he knew that the Melancholist had somewhat of money;
so he fell to spying upon him and ceased not watching him till
he saw him put into an earthen pot that which he had with him of
silvers and enter a deserted ruin, where he sat down, as if to make
water, and dug a hole, wherein he laid the pot and covering
it up, smoothed the ground as it had been. Then he went
away and the Sharper came and taking what was in the pot,
restored it to its former place. Presently ’Ajlan returned, with
somewhat to add to his hoard, but found it not; so he bethought
him of who had followed him and remembered that he had found
that Sharper assiduous in sitting with him and questioning him.
So he went in search of him, assured that he had taken the
pot, and gave not over looking for him till he saw him sitting;
whereupon he ran to him and the Sharper saw him. Then
the Melancholist stood within earshot and muttered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5474" id="noteref-5474" epub:type="noteref">5474</a> to himself
and said, “In the pot are sixty ducats and I have with me other
twenty in such a place and to-day I will unite the whole in the
pot.” When the Sharper heard him say this to himself, muttering
and mumbling, repeating and blundering in his speech, he
repented him of having taken the sequins and said, “He will
presently return to the pot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5475" id="noteref-5475" epub:type="noteref">5475</a> and find it empty; wherefore that
for which I am on the look-out will escape me; and meseemeth
’twere best I replace the dinars, so he may see them and leave all
which is with him in the pot, and I can take the whole.” Now he
feared to return to the pot at once, lest the Melancholist should
follow him to the place and find nothing and on this wise his
arrangements be marred; so he said to him, “O ’Ajlan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5476" id="noteref-5476" epub:type="noteref">5476</a> I would
have thee come to my lodging and eat bread with me.” Thereupon
the Melancholist went with him to his quarters and he
seated him there and going to the market, sold somewhat of
his clothes and pawned somewhat from his house and bought the
best of food. Then he betook himself to the ruin and replacing
the money in the pot, buried it again; after which he returned
to his lodging and gave the Melancholist to eat and drink,
and they went out together. The Sharper walked away and hid
himself, lest his guest should see him, whilst ’Ajlan repaired to
his hiding-place and took the pot. Presently, the Sharper returned
to the ruin, rejoicing in that which he deemed he should get,
and dug in the place, but found naught and knew that the
Melancholist had outwitted him. So he began buffetting his
face for regret, and fell to following the other whitherso he went,
to the intent that he might win what was with him, but he failed
in this, because the Melancholist knew what was in his mind and
was assured that he spied upon him; so he kept watch over
himself. Now, had the Sharper considered the consequences of
haste and that which is begotten of loss therefrom, he had not done
on such wise. “Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this tale, O king
of the age, rarer or stranger or daintier than the story of Khalbas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5477" id="noteref-5477" epub:type="noteref">5477</a>
and his Wife and the learned man and that which befel between
the three.” When the king heard this story, he left his purpose
of putting the Minister to death and his soul bade him to continue
him on life. So he ordered him off to his house.</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF KHALBAS AND HIS WIFE AND THE LEARNED MAN</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a man called Khalbas, who was a fulsome
fellow, a calamity, notorious for this note, and he had a charming
wife, renowned for beauty and loveliness. A man of his townsfolk
fell in love with her and she also loved him. Now Khalbas was
a wily wight and full of guile, and there was in his neighbourhood
a learned man, to whom the folk used to resort every day
and he told them histories and admonished them with moral
instances; and Khalbas was wont to be present in his assembly,
for the sake of making a show before the folk. This learned man
also had a wife famed for comeliness and seemlihead and quickness
of wit and understanding and the lover sought some device
whereby he might manage to meet Khalbas’s wife; so he came to
him and told him as a secret what he had seen of the learned
man’s wife and confided to him that he was in love with her and
besought his assistance in this. Khalbas told him that she was
known as a model of chastity and continence and that she exposed
herself not to ill doubts; but the other said, “I cannot renounce
her, in the first place because the woman inclineth to me and
coveteth my wealth, and secondly, because of the greatness of my
fondness for her; and naught is wanting but thy help.” Quoth
Khalbas, “I will do thy will;” and quoth the other, “Thou shalt
have of me every day two silvern dirhams, on condition that thou
sit with the learned man and that, when he riseth from the
assembly, thou speak a word which shall notify to me the breaking
up of the meeting.” So they agreed upon that and Khalbas
entered and sat in the session, whilst the lover was assured in his
heart that the secret was safe and secure with him, wherefore he
rejoiced and was content to pay the two dirhams. Then Khalbas
used to attend the learned man’s assembly, whilst the other would
go into his wife and be very much with her, on such wise as he
thought good, till the learned man arose from his meeting; and
when Khalbas saw that he proposed rising, he would speak a word
for the lover to hear, whereupon he went forth from the wife of
Khalbas who knew not that doom was in his own home. But when
the learned man saw Khalbas do the same thing every day, he
began to suspect him, especially on account of that which he knew
of his bad name, and suspicion grew upon him; so, one day, he
resolved to advance the time of his rising ere the wonted hour and
hastening up to Khalbas, seized him and said to him, “By Allah,
an thou say a single syllable, I will do thee a damage!” Then he
went in to his wife, with Khalbas in his grip, and behold, she was
sitting, as of her wont, nor was there about her aught of suspicious
or unseemly. The learned man bethought him awhile of this,
then made for Khalbas’s house, which adjoined his own, still holding
his man; and when they entered, they found the young lover
lying on the bed with Khalbas’s wife; whereupon quoth the
learned man to him, “O accursed, the doom is with thee and in
thine own home!” So Khalbas divorced his wife and went forth,
fleeing, and returned not to his own land. “This, then” (continued
the Wazir), “is the consequence of lewdness, for whoso
purposeth in himself wile and perfidious guile, they get possession of
him, and had Khalbas conceived of himself that dishonour and calamity
which he conceived of the folk, there had betided him nothing
of this. Nor is this tale, rare and curious though it be, stranger or
rarer than the story of the Devotee whose husband’s brother
accused her of lewdness.” When the king heard this, wonderment
gat hold of him and his admiration for the Wazir redoubled;
so he bade him hie to his home and return to him on the morrow,
according to his custom. So the Minister withdrew to his lodging,
where he passed the night and the ensuing day.</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE DEVOTEE ACCUSED OF LEWDNESS</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5478" id="noteref-5478" epub:type="noteref">5478</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a man of Níshábúr<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5479" id="noteref-5479" epub:type="noteref">5479</a> who, having a wife of the
uttermost beauty and piety, yet was minded to set out on the
pilgrimage. So before leaving home he commended her to the
care of his brother and besought him to aid her in her affairs and
further her wishes till he should return, for the brothers were on
the most intimate terms.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5480" id="noteref-5480" epub:type="noteref">5480</a> Then he took ship and departed
and his absence was prolonged. Meanwhile, the brother went to
visit his brother’s wife, at all times and seasons, and questioned
her of her circumstances and went about her wants; and when
his calls were prolonged and he heard her speech and saw her
face, the love of her gat hold upon his heart and he became
passionately fond of her and his soul prompted him to evil. So
he besought her to lie with him, but she refused and showed him
how foul was his deed, and he found him no way to win what he
wished;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5481" id="noteref-5481" epub:type="noteref">5481</a> wherefore he wooed her with soft speech and gentle
ways. Now she was righteous in all her doings and never swerved
from one saying;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5482" id="noteref-5482" epub:type="noteref">5482</a> so, when he saw that she consented not to him,
he had no doubts but that she would tell his brother, when
he returned from his journey, and quoth he to her, “An thou
consent not to whatso I require of thee, I will cause a scandal to
befal thee and thou wilt perish.” Quoth she, “Allah (extolled and
exalted be He!) judge betwixt me and thee, and know that,
shouldst thou hew me limb from limb, I would not consent to
that thou biddest me to do.” His ignorance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5483" id="noteref-5483" epub:type="noteref">5483</a> of womankind persuaded
him that she would tell her spouse; so he betook himself
of his exceeding despite, to a company of people in the mosque and
informed them that he had witnessed a man commit adultery with
his brother’s wife. They believed his word and documented his
charge and assembled to stone her.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5484" id="noteref-5484" epub:type="noteref">5484</a> Then they dug her a pit
outside the city and seating her therein, stoned her, till they
deemed her dead, when they left her. Presently a Shaykh of a
village passed by the pit and finding her alive, carried her to his
house and cured her of her wounds. Now he had a youthful son,
who, as soon as he saw her, loved her and besought her of her
person; but she refused and consented not to him, whereupon he
redoubled in love and longing and his case prompted him to
suborn a youth of the people of his village and agree with him
that he should come by night and take somewhat from his father’s
house and that, when he was seized and discovered, he should
say that she was his accomplice in this and avouch that she was
his mistress and had been stoned on his account in the city.
Accordingly he did this, and, coming by night to the villager’s
house, stole therefrom goods and clothes; whereupon the owner
awoke and seizing the thief, pinioned him straitly and beat him
to make him confess; and he confessed against the woman that
she was a partner in the crime and that he was her lover from
the city. The news was bruited abroad and the citizens assembled
to put her to death; but the Shaykh with whom she was forbade
them and said, “I brought this woman hither, coveting the
recompense of Allah, and I know not the truth of that which
is said of her and will not empower any to hurt or harm her.”
Then he gave her a thousand dirhams, by way of alms, and thrust
her forth of the village. As for the thief, he was imprisoned for
some days; after which the folk interceded for him with the old
man, saying, “This is a youth and indeed he erred;” and he
released him from his bonds. Meanwhile the woman went out at
hap-hazard and donning a devotee’s dress, fared on without ceasing,
till she came to a city and found the king’s deputies dunning
the townsfolk for the tribute, out of season. Presently, she saw
a man, whom they were pressing for the tribute; so she asked
of his case and being acquainted with it, paid down the thousand
dirhams for him and delivered him from the bastinado; whereupon
he thanked her and those who were present. When he
was set free, he walked with her and besought her to go with him
to his dwelling: accordingly, she accompanied him thither and
supped with him and passed the night. When the dark hours
gloomed on him, his soul prompted him to evil, for that which
he saw of her beauty and loveliness, and he lusted after her,
and required her of her person; but she rejected him and
threatened him with Allah the Most High and reminded him of
that which she had done with him of kindness and how she had
delivered him from the stick and its disgrace. However, he would
not be denied, and when he saw her persistent refusal of herself
to him, he feared lest she should tell the folk of him. So, when
he arose in the morning, he wrote on a paper what he would of
forgery and falsehood and going up to the Sultan’s palace, said,
“I have an advisement for the King.” So he bade admit him
and he delivered him the writ he had forged, saying, “I found this
letter with the woman, the devotee, the ascetic, and indeed she
is a spy, a secret informer against the sovran to his foe; and I
deem the King’s due more incumbent on me than any other claim
and warning him to be the first duty, for that he uniteth in himself
all the subjects, and but for the King’s existence, the lieges would
perish; wherefore I have brought thee good counsel.” The King gave
credit to his words and sent with him those who should lay hands
upon the Devotee and do her to death; but they found her not.
As for the woman, when the man went out from her, she resolved
to depart; so she fared forth, saying to herself, “There is no wayfaring
for me in woman’s habit.” Then she donned men’s dress,
such as is worn of the pious, and set out and wandered over the
earth; nor did she cease wandering till she entered a certain city.
Now the king of that city had an only daughter, in whom he
gloried and whom he loved, and she saw the Devotee and deeming
her a pilgrim youth, said to her father, “I would fain have this
youth take up his lodging with me, so I may learn of him lere
and piety and religion.” Her father rejoiced in this and commanded
the pilgrim to take up his abode with his daughter in
his palace. So they were in one place and the Princess was
strenuous to the uttermost in continence and chastity and nobility
of mind and magnanimity and devotion; but the ignorant tattled
anent her, and the folk of the realm said, “The king’s daughter
loveth the pilgrim youth and he loveth her.” Now the king was
a very old man and destiny decreed the ending of his life-term;
so he died and when he was buried, the lieges assembled and
many were the sayings of the people and of the king’s kinsfolk
and officers, and they counselled together to slay the Princess
and the young pilgrim, saying, “This fellow dishonoureth us with
yonder whore and none accepteth shame save the base.” So they
fell upon them and slew the king’s daughter in her mosque, without
asking her of aught; whereupon the pious woman (whom
they deemed a youth) said to them, “Woe to you, O miscreants
Ye have slain the pious lady.” Quoth they, “O thou fulsome
fellow, dost thou bespeak us thus? Thou lovedst her and she
loved thee, and we will assuredly slay thee.” And quoth she,
“Allah forfend. Indeed, the affair is the clear reverse of this.”
They asked, “What proof hast thou of that?” and she answered,
“Bring me women.” They did so, and when the matrons looked
on her, they found her a woman. As soon as the townsfolk saw this,
they repented of that they had done and the affair was grievous
to them; so they sought pardon of Allah and said to her, “By the
virtue of Him whom thou servest, do thou crave pardon for us.”
Said she, “As for me, I may no longer tarry with you and I am
about to depart from you.” Then they humbled themselves before
her and shed tears and said to her, “We conjure thee, by the
might of Allah the Most High, that thou take upon thyself the
rule of the realm and of the lieges.” But she refused and drew
her back; whereupon they came up to her and wept and ceased
not supplicating her, till she consented and undertook the kingship.
Her first commandment to them was that they bury the
Princess and build over her a dome and she abode in that palace,
worshipping the Almighty and dealing judgment between the
people with justice, and Allah (extolled and exalted be He!)
vouchsafed her, for the excellence of her piety and her patience
and renunciation, the acceptance of her prayers, so that she
sought not aught of Him (to whom belong Might and Majesty),
but He granted her petition; and her fame was bruited abroad
in all lands. Accordingly, the folk resorted to her from all parts
and she used to pray Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty)
for the oppressed and the Lord granted him relief, and against his
oppressor, and He brake him asunder; and she prayed for the
sick and they were made sound; and in this goodly way she
tarried a great space of time. So fared it with the wife; but
as for her husband, when he returned from the pilgrimage, his
brother and the neighbours acquainted him with the affair of his
spouse, whereat he was sore concerned and suspected their story,
for that which he knew of her chastity and prayerfulness; and he
shed tears for the loss of her. Meanwhile, she prayed to Almighty
Allah that He would stablish her innocence in the eyes of her
spouse and the folk, and He sent down upon her husband’s
brother a sickness so sore that none knew a cure for him.
Wherefore he said to his brother, “In such a city is a Devotee, a
worshipful woman and a recluse whose prayers are accepted; so
do thou carry me to her, that she may pray for my healing and
Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty) may give me ease of
this disease.” Accordingly, he took him up and journeyed with
him, till they came to the village where dwelt the Shaykh, the grey
beard who had rescued the devout woman from the pit and carried
her to his dwelling and healed her in his home. Here they
halted and lodged with the old man, who questioned the husband
of his case and that of his brother and the cause of their journey,
and he said, “I purpose to go with my brother, this sick wight, to
the holy woman, her whose petitions are answered, so she may
pray for him, and Allah may heal him by the blessing of her
orisons.” Quoth the villager, “By Allah, my son is in parlous
plight for sickness and we have heard that this Devotee prayeth
for the sick and they are made sound. Indeed, the folk counsel
me to carry him to her, and behold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5485" id="noteref-5485" epub:type="noteref">5485</a> I will go in company with
you.” And they said, “’Tis well.” So they all nighted in that
intent and on the morrow they set out for the dwelling of the
Devotee, this one carrying his son and that one bearing his
brother. Now the man who had stolen the clothes and had forged
against the pious woman a lie, to wit, that he was her lover,
sickened of a sore sickness, and his people took him up and set
out with him to visit the Devotee and crave her prayers, and
Destiny brought them altogether by the way. So they fared
forward in a body till they came to the city wherein the man
dwelt for whom she had paid the thousand dirhams to deliver
him from torture, and found him about to travel to her by reason
of a malady which had betided him. Accordingly, they all
journeyed on together, unknowing that the holy woman was she
whom they had so foully wronged, and ceased not going till they
came to her city and foregathered at the gates of her palace, that
wherein was the tomb of the Princess. Now the folk used to go
into her and salute her with the salam, and crave her orisons; and
it was her custom to pray for none till he had confessed to her
his sins, when she would ask pardon for him and pray for him
that he might be healed, and he was straightway made whole of
sickness, by permission of Almighty Allah. When the four sick
men were brought in to her, she knew them forthright, though they
knew her not, and said to them “Let each of you confess and
specify his sins, so I may sue pardon for him and pray for him.”
And the brother said, “As for me, I required my brother’s wife
of her person and she refused; whereupon despite and ignorance
prompted me and I lied against her and accused her to the townsfolk
of adultery; so they stoned her and slew her wrongously and
unrighteously; and this my complaint is the issue of unright and
falsehood and of the slaying of the innocent soul, whose slaughter
Allah hath made unlawful to man.” Then said the youth, the
old villager’s son, “And I, O holy woman, my father brought to us
a woman who had been stoned, and my people nursed her till
she recovered. Now she was rare of beauty and loveliness;
so I required her of her person; but she refused and clave in
chastity to Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty), wherefore
ignorance prompted me, so that I agreed with one of the youths
that he should steal clothes and coin from my father’s house.
Then I laid hands on him and carried him to my sire and made
him confess. He declared that the woman was his mistress from
the city and had been stoned on his account and that she was
his accomplice in the theft and had opened the doors to him; but
this was a lie against her, for that she had not yielded to me in
that which I sought of her. So there befel me what ye see of
requital.” And the young man, the thief, said, “I am he with
whom thou agreedst concerning the theft, and to whom thou
openedst the door, and I am he who accused her falsely and
calumniously and Allah (extolled be He!) well knoweth that I
never did evil with her; no, nor knew her in any way before that
time.” Then said he whom she had delivered from torture by
paying down a thousand dirhams and who had required her of
her person in his house, for that her beauty pleased him, and
when she refused had forged a letter against her and treacherously
denounced her to the Sultan and requited her graciousness with
ingratitude, “I am he who wronged her and lied against her,
and this is the issue of the oppressor’s affair.” When she
heard their words, in the presence of the folk, she cried
“Alhamdolillah, praise be to Allah, the King who over all things
is omnipotent, and blessing upon His prophets and apostles!”
Then quoth she to the assembly, “Bear testimony, O ye here
present, to these men’s speech, and know ye I am that woman
whom they confess to having wronged.” And she turned to her
husband’s brother and said to him, “I am thy brother’s wife and
Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) delivered me from that whereinto
thou castedst me of calumny and suspicion, and from the
folly and frowardness whereof thou hast spoken, and now hath
He shown forth my innocence, of His bounty and generosity.
Go, for thou art quit of the wrong thou didst me.” Then she prayed
for him and he was made sound of his sickness. Thereupon she
said to the son of the village Shaykh, “Know that I am the woman
whom thy father delivered from strain and stress and whom
there betided from thee of calumny and ignorance that which thou
hast named.” And she sued pardon for him and he was made
sound of his sickness. Then said she to the thief, “I am the
woman against whom thou liedst, avouching that I was thy leman
who had been stoned on thine account, and that I was thine
accomplice in robbing the house of the village Shaykh and had
opened the doors to thee.” And she prayed for him and he was
made whole of his malady.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5486" id="noteref-5486" epub:type="noteref">5486</a> Then said she to the townsman, him
of the tribute, “I am the woman who gave thee the thousand
dirhams and thou didst with me what thou didst.” And she asked
pardon for him and prayed for him and he was made whole;
whereupon the folk marvelled at her enemies who had all been
afflicted alike, so Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) might show
forth her innocence upon the heads of witnesses.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5487" id="noteref-5487" epub:type="noteref">5487</a> Then she turned
to the old man who had delivered her from the pit and prayed for
him and gave him presents manifold and among them a myriad,
a Badrah;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5488" id="noteref-5488" epub:type="noteref">5488</a> and the sick made whole departed from her. When
she was alone with her husband, she made him draw near unto
her and rejoiced in his arrival, and gave him the choice of abiding
with her. Presently, she assembled the citizens and notified to
them his virtue and worth and counselled them to invest him with
management of their rule and besought them to make him king
over them. They consented to her on this and he became king
and made his home amongst them, whilst she gave herself up to
her orisons and cohabited with her husband as she was with him
aforetime. “Nor,” continued the Wazir, “is this tale, O king of the
time, stranger or pleasanter than that of the Hireling and the Girl
whose maw he slit and fled.” When King Shah Bakht heard this, he
said, “Most like all they say of the Minister is leasing, and his
innocence will be made manifest even as that of the Devotee was
manifested.” Then he comforted the Wazir’s heart and bade him
hie to his house.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King bade fetch the Wazir and
sought of him the story of the Hireling and the Girl. So he said,
“Hearkening and obedience. Give ear, O auspicious King, to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE HIRELING AND THE GIRL</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, of old time, in one of the tribes of the Arabs, a
woman pregnant by her husband, and they had a hired servant, a
man of insight and understanding. When the woman came to her
delivery-time, she gave birth to a girl-child in the night and they
sought fire of the neighbours.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5489" id="noteref-5489" epub:type="noteref">5489</a> So the Hireling went in quest of
fire. Now there was in the camp a Divineress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5490" id="noteref-5490" epub:type="noteref">5490</a> and she questioned
him of the new-born child, an it was male or female. Quoth he,
“’Tis a girl;” and quoth she, “That girl will whore with an
hundred men and a hireling shall wed her and a spider shall slay
her.” When the hired man heard this, he returned upon his steps
and going in to the woman, took the child from her by wily
management and slit its maw: then he fled forth into the wold
at hap-hazard and abode in strangerhood while Allah so willed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5491" id="noteref-5491" epub:type="noteref">5491</a>
He gained much money; and, returning to his own land, after
twenty years’ absence, alighted in the neighbourhood of an old
woman, whom he wheedled and treated with liberality, requiring
of her a young person whom he might enjoy without marriage.
Said she, “I know none but a certain fair woman, who is renowned
for this industry.” Then she described her charms to him and
made him lust after her, and he said, “Hasten to her this minute
and lavish upon her whatso she asketh.” So the crone betook
herself to the girl and discovered his wishes to her and invited her
to him; but she answered, “’Tis true that I was in habit of whoredom,
but now I have repented to Almighty Allah and have no
more longing to this: nay, I desire lawful wedlock; so, if he be
content with that which is legal, I am between his hands.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5492" id="noteref-5492" epub:type="noteref">5492</a> The
old woman returned to the man and told him what the damsel
said; and he lusted after her, because of her beauty and her penitence;
so he took her to wife, and when he went in to her, he
loved her and after like fashion she loved him. Thus they
abode a great while, till one day he questioned her of the
cause of a scar<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5493" id="noteref-5493" epub:type="noteref">5493</a> he espied on her body, and she said, “I wot
naught thereof save that my mother told me a marvellous thing
concerning it.” Asked he, “What was that?” and she answered,
“My mother declared that she gave birth to me one night of the
wintry nights and despatched a hired man, who was with us, in
quest of fire for her. He was absent a little while and presently
returning, took me and slit my maw and fled. When my mother
saw this, chagrin seized her and compassion possessed her; so she
sewed up my stomach and nursed me till the wound healed by the
ordinance of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty).” When
her husband heard this, he said to her, “What is thy name and
what may be the name of thy mother and who may be thy
father?” She told him their names and her own, whereby he
knew that it was she whose maw he had slit and said to
her, “And where are thy mother and father?” “They are
both dead.” “I am that Hireling who slit thy stomach.”
“Why didst thou that?” “Because of a saying I heard from the
wise woman.” “What was it?” “She declared thou wouldst play
the whore with an hundred men and that I after that should wed
thee.” “Ay, I have whored with an hundred men, no more and
no less, and behold, thou hast married me.” “The Divineress
also foresaid, that thou shouldst die, at the last of thy life, of the
bite of a spider. Indeed, her saying hath been verified of the
fornication and the marriage, and I fear lest her word come true
no less in the death.” Then they betook themselves to a place
without the city, where he builded him a mansion of solid stone
and white stucco and stopped its inner walls and plastered them;
leaving not therein or cranny or crevice, and he set in it two slave-girls
whose services were sweeping and wiping, for fear of spiders.
Here he abode with his wife a great while, till one day the man
espied a spider on the ceiling and beat it down. When his wife
saw it, she said, “This is that which the wise woman foresaid
would slay me; so, by thy life, suffer me to kill it with mine own
hand.” Her husband forbade her from this, but she conjured him
to let her destroy the spider; then, of her fearfulness and her eagerness,
she took a piece of wood and smote it. The wood brake of
the force of the blow, and a splinter from it entered her hand and
wrought upon it, so that it swelled. Then her fore-arm also swelled
and the swelling spread to her side and thence grew till it reached
her heart and she died. “Nor,” (continued the Wazir), “is this
stranger or more wondrous than the story of the Weaver who
became a Leach by commandment of his wife.” When the King
heard this, his admiration redoubled and he said, “In very
truth, Destiny is written to all creatures, and I will not accept
aught that is said against my Minister the loyal counsellor.”
And he bade him hie to his home.</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE WEAVER WHO BECAME A LEACH BY ORDER OF HIS WIFE</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, in the land of Fars,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5494" id="noteref-5494" epub:type="noteref">5494</a> a man who wedded a woman
higher than himself in rank and nobler of lineage, but she had no
guardian to preserve her from want. She loathed to marry one
who was beneath her; yet she wived with him because of need,
and took of him a bond in writing to the effect that he would ever
be under her order to bid and forbid and would never thwart her
in word or in deed. Now the man was a Weaver and he bound
himself in writing to pay his wife ten thousand dirhams in case of
default. After such fashion they abode a long while till one day
the wife went out to fetch water, of which she had need, and saw a
leach who had spread a carpet hard by the road, whereon he had
set out great store of simples<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5495" id="noteref-5495" epub:type="noteref">5495</a> and implements of medicine and he
was speaking and muttering charms, whilst the folk flocked to him
from all quarters and girt him about on every side. The Weaver’s
wife marvelled at the largeness of the physician’s fortune<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5496" id="noteref-5496" epub:type="noteref">5496</a> and
said in herself, “Were my husband thus, he would lead an easy
life and that wherein we are of straitness and poverty would be
widened to him.” Then she returned home, cark-full and care-full,
and when her husband saw her in this condition, he questioned
her of her case and she said to him, “Verily, my breast is
narrowed by reason of thee and of the very goodness of thine
intent,” presently adding, “Narrow means suit me not and thou
in thy present craft gainest naught; so either do thou seek out a
business other than this or pay me my rightful due<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5497" id="noteref-5497" epub:type="noteref">5497</a> and let me
wend my ways.” Her husband chid her for this and advised her
to take patience; but she would not be turned from her design and
said to him, “Go forth and watch yonder physician how he doth
and learn from him what he saith.” Said he, “Let not thy heart
be troubled,” and added, “I will go every day to the session of
the leach.” So he began resorting daily to the physician and committing
to memory his answers and that which he spoke of jargon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5498" id="noteref-5498" epub:type="noteref">5498</a>
till he had gotten a great matter by rote, and all this he learned
and thoroughly digested it. Then he returned to his wife and said
to her, “I have stored up the physician’s sayings in memory and
have mastered his manner of muttering and diagnoses and prescribing
remedies and I wot by heart the names of the medicines<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5499" id="noteref-5499" epub:type="noteref">5499</a>
and of all the diseases, and there abideth of thy bidding naught
undone: so what dost thou command me now to do?” Quoth she,
“Leave the loom and open thyself a leach’s shop;” but quoth he,
“My fellow-townsmen know me and this affair will not profit me,
save in a land of strangerhood; so come, let us go out from this
city and get us to a foreign land and there live.” And she said,
“Do whatso thou willest.” Accordingly, he arose and taking his
weaving gear, sold it and bought with the price drugs and simples
and wrought himself a carpet, with which they set out and
journeyed to a certain village, where they took up their abode.
Then the man fell to going round about the hamlets and villages
and outskirts of towns, after donning leach’s dress; and he began
to earn his livelihood and make much gain. Their affairs
prospered and their circumstances were bettered; wherefore they
praised Allah for their present ease and the village became to them
a home. In this way he lived for a long time, but at length he
wandered anew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5500" id="noteref-5500" epub:type="noteref">5500</a> and the days and the nights ceased not to transport
him from country to country, till he came to the land of the
Roum and lighted down in a city of the cities thereof, wherein was
Jálínús<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5501" id="noteref-5501" epub:type="noteref">5501</a> the Sage; but the Weaver knew him not, nor was aware
who he was. So he fared forth, as was his wont, in quest of a
place where the folk might be gathered together, and hired the
courtyard<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5502" id="noteref-5502" epub:type="noteref">5502</a> of Jalinus. There he spread his carpet and setting out
on it his simples and instruments of medicine, praised himself
and his skill and claimed a cleverness such as none but he might
claim.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5503" id="noteref-5503" epub:type="noteref">5503</a> Jalinus heard that which he affirmed of his understanding
and it was certified unto him and established in his mind that the
man was a skilled leach of the leaches of the Persians and he said
in himself, “Unless he had confidence in his knowledge and were
minded to confront me and contend with me, he had not sought
the door of my house neither had he spoken that which he hath
spoken.” And care and doubt gat hold upon Jalinus: so he drew
near the Weaver and addressed himself to see how his doings
should end, whilst the folk began to flock to him and describe to
him their ailments,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5504" id="noteref-5504" epub:type="noteref">5504</a> and he would answer them thereof, hitting the
mark one while and missing it another while, so that naught appeared
to Jalinus of his fashion whereby his mind might be assured
that he had justly estimated his skill. Presently, up came a woman
with a urinal,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5505" id="noteref-5505" epub:type="noteref">5505</a> and when the Weaver saw the phial afar off, he said
to her, “This is the water of a man, a stranger.” Said she,
“Yes;” and he continued, “Is he not a Jew and is not his ailment
flatulence?” “Yes,” replied the woman, and the folk marvelled
at this; wherefore the man was magnified in the eyes of Jalinus,
for that he heard speech such as was not of the usage of doctors,
seeing that they know not urine but by shaking it and looking
straitly thereon, neither wot they a man’s water from a woman’s
water, nor a stranger’s from a countryman’s, nor a Jew’s from a
Sharif’s.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5506" id="noteref-5506" epub:type="noteref">5506</a> Then the woman asked, “What is the remedy?” and
the Weaver answered, “Bring the honorarium.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5507" id="noteref-5507" epub:type="noteref">5507</a> So she paid him
a dirham and he gave her medicines contrary to that ailment and
such as would only aggravate the complaint. When Jalinus saw
what appeared to him of the man’s incapacity, he turned to his
disciples and pupils and bade them fetch the mock doctor, with all
his gear and drugs. Accordingly they brought him into his presence
without stay or delay, and when Jalinus saw him before him, he asked
him, “Knowest thou me?” and the other answered, “No, nor did
I ever set eyes on thee before this day.” Quoth the Sage, “Dost
thou know Jalinus?” and quoth the Weaver, “No.” Then said
Jalinus, “What drave thee to do that which thou dost?” So he
acquainted him with his adventure, especially with the dowry and
the obligation by which he was bound with regard to his wife
whereat the Sage marvelled and certified himself anent the matter
of the marriage-settlement. Then he bade lodge him near himself
and entreated him with kindness and took him apart and said to
him, “Expound to me the story of the urine-phial and whence
thou knewest that the water therein was that of a man, and he a
stranger and a Jew, and that his ailment was flatulence?” The
Weaver replied, “’Tis well. Thou must know that we people of
Persia are skilled in physiognomy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5508" id="noteref-5508" epub:type="noteref">5508</a> and I saw the woman to be
rosy-cheeked, blue-eyed and tall-statured. Now these qualities
belong to women who are enamoured of a man and are distracted
for love of him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5509" id="noteref-5509" epub:type="noteref">5509</a> moreover, I saw her burning with anxiety; so I
knew that the patient was her husband.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5510" id="noteref-5510" epub:type="noteref">5510</a> As for his strangerhood,
I noted that the dress of the woman differed from that of the
townsfolk, wherefore I knew that she was a foreigner; and in the
mouth of the phial I saw a yellow rag,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5511" id="noteref-5511" epub:type="noteref">5511</a> which garred me wot
that the sick man was a Jew and she a Jewess. Moreover, she
came to me on first day;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5512" id="noteref-5512" epub:type="noteref">5512</a> and ’tis the Jews’ custom to take
meat-puddings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5513" id="noteref-5513" epub:type="noteref">5513</a> and food that hath passed the night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5514" id="noteref-5514" epub:type="noteref">5514</a> and eat them
on the Saturday their Sabbath, hot and cold, and they exceed in
eating; wherefore flatulence and indigestion betide them. Thus I
was directed and guessed that which thou hast heard.” Now when
Jalinus heard this, he ordered the Weaver the amount of his wife’s
dowry and bade him pay it to her and said to him, “Divorce her.”
Furthermore, he forbade him from returning to the practice of
physic and warned him never again to take to wife a woman of
rank higher than his own; and he gave him his spending-money
and charged him return to his proper craft. “Nor” (continued the
Wazir), “is this tale stranger or rarer than the story of the Two
Sharpers who each cozened his Compeer.” When King Shah Bakht
heard this, he said to himself, “How like is this story to my
present case with this Minister, who hath not his like!” Then
he bade him hie to his own house and come again at eventide.</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE TWO SHARPERS WHO EACH COZENED HIS COMPEER</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, in the city of Baghdad, a man hight Al-Marwazí,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5515" id="noteref-5515" epub:type="noteref">5515</a>
who was a sharper and ruined the folk with his rogueries
and he was renowned in all quarters for knavery. He went
out one day, carrying a load of sheep’s droppings, and sware to
himself that he would not return to his lodging till he had sold it
at the price of raisins. Now there was in another city a second
sharper, hight Al-Rází,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5516" id="noteref-5516" epub:type="noteref">5516</a> one of its worst, who went out the same
day, bearing a load of goat’s droppings,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5517" id="noteref-5517" epub:type="noteref">5517</a> anent which he had
sworn to himself that he would not sell it but at the price of sun-dried
figs. So the twain fared on with that which was by them
and ceased not going till they met in one of the khans<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5518" id="noteref-5518" epub:type="noteref">5518</a> and
one complained to other of what he had suffered on travel in
quest of gain and of the little demand for his wares. Now each
of them had it in mind to cheat his fellow; so the man of Marw
said to the man of Rayy, “Wilt thou sell me that?” He said,
“Yes,” and the other continued, “And wilt thou buy that which
is with me?” The man of Rayy consented; so they agreed
upon this and each of them sold to his mate that which was with
him in exchange for the other’s; after which they bade farewell
and both fared forth. As soon as the twain were out of sight,
they examined their loads, to see what was therein, and one of
them found that he had a load of sheep’s droppings and the other
that he had a load of goat’s droppings; whereupon each of them
turned back in quest of his fellow. They met again in the khan
and laughing at each other cancelled their bargain; then they
agreed to enter into partnership and that all they had of money
and other good should be in common, share and share alike. Then
quoth Al-Razi to Al-Marwazi, “Come with me to my city, for
that ’tis nearer than thine.” So he went with him, and when he
arrived at his quarters, he said to his wife and household and
neighbours, “This is my brother, who hath been absent in the land
of Khorasan and is come back.” And he abode with him in all
honour for a space of three days. On the fourth day, Al-Razi
said to him, “Know, O my brother, that I purpose to do something.”
The other asked, “What is it?” and the first answered,
“I mean to feign myself dead and do thou go to the bazar and
hire two porters and a bier. Then take me up and go about the
streets and markets with my body and collect alms on my
account.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5519" id="noteref-5519" epub:type="noteref">5519</a>” Accordingly the Marw man repaired to the market and,
fetching that which he sought, returned to the Rayy man’s house,
where he found his fellow cast down in the entrance-passage, with
his beard tied and his eyes shut, and his complexion was paled
and his belly was blown and his limbs were loose. So he deemed
him really dead and shook him but he spoke not; then he took
a knife and pricked his feet, but he budged not. Presently
said Al-Razi, “What is this, O fool?” and said Al-Marwazi,
“I deemed thou wast dead in very deed.” Al-Razi cried, “Get
thee to business, and leave funning.” So he took him up and
went with him to the market and collected alms for him that
day till eventide, when he bore him back to his abode and
waited till the morrow. Next morning, he again took up the
bier and walked round with it as before, in quest of charity.
Presently, the Chief of Police, who was of those who had given
him alms on the previous day, met him; so he was angered
and fell on the porters and beat them and took the dead body,
saying, “I will bury him and win reward in Heaven.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5520" id="noteref-5520" epub:type="noteref">5520</a> So
his followers took him up and carrying him to the Police-officer,
fetched grave-diggers, who dug him a grave. Then they
brought him a shroud and perfumes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5521" id="noteref-5521" epub:type="noteref">5521</a> and fetched an old man of
the quarter, to wash him: so the Shaykh recited over him the
appointed prayers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5522" id="noteref-5522" epub:type="noteref">5522</a> and laying him on the bench, washed him and
shrouded him. After he had been shrouded he skited;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5523" id="noteref-5523" epub:type="noteref">5523</a> so the
grey beard renewed the washing and went away to make the Wuzu-ablution,
whilst all the folk departed to do likewise, before the orisons
of the funeral. When the dead man found himself alone, he sprang
up, as he were a Satan; and, donning the corpse-washer’s dress,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5524" id="noteref-5524" epub:type="noteref">5524</a>
took the cups and water-can<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5525" id="noteref-5525" epub:type="noteref">5525</a> and wrapped them up in the napkins;
then he clapped his shroud under his armpit and went out. The
doorkeepers thought that he was the washer and asked him, “Hast
thou made an end of the washing, so we may acquaint the Emir?”
The sharper answered “Yes,” and made off to his abode, where
he found the Marw man a-wooing his wife and saying to her,
“By thy life, thou wilt never again look upon his face for the best
reason that by this time he is buried: I myself escaped not from
them but after toil and trouble, and if he speak, they will do him
to death.” Quoth she, “And what wouldst thou have of me?” and
quoth he, “Satisfy my desire and heal my disorder, for I am
better than thy husband.” And he began toying with her as a
prelude to possession. Now when the Rayy man heard this, he
said, “Yonder wittol-pimp lusteth after my wife; but I will at
once do him a damage.” Then he rushed in upon them, and when
Al-Marwazi saw him, he wondered at him and said to him, “How
didst thou make thine escape?” Accordingly he told him the trick
he had played and they abode talking of that which they had
collected from the folk, and indeed they had gotten great store of
money. Then said the man of Marw, “In very sooth, mine
absence hath been prolonged and lief would I return to my own
land.” Al-Razi said, “As thou willest;” and the other rejoined,
“Let us divide the monies we have made and do thou go with me
to my home, so I may show thee my tricks and my works.”
Replied the man of Rayy, “Come to-morrow, and we will divide
the coin.” So the Marw man went away and the other turned to
his wife and said to her, “We have collected us great plenty of
money, and the dog would fain take the half of it; but such thing
shall never be, for my mind hath been changed against him, since I
heard him making love to thee; now, therefore, I propose to play
him a trick and enjoy all the money; and do thou not oppose me.”
She replied, “’Tis well;” and he said to her, “To-morrow, at
peep o’ day I will feign myself dead, and do thou cry aloud and tear
thy hair, whereupon the folk will flock to me. Then lay me out
and bury me; and, when the folk are gone away from the
grave, dig down to me and take me; and fear not for me, as I can
abide without harm two days in the tomb-niche.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5526" id="noteref-5526" epub:type="noteref">5526</a> Whereto she
made answer, “Do e’en whatso thou wilt.” Accordingly, when it
was the dawn-hour, she bound his beard and spreading a veil over
him, shrieked aloud, whereupon the people of the quarter flocked
to her, men and women. Presently, up came Al-Marwazi, for the
division of the money, and hearing the keening asked, “What may
be the news?” Quoth they, “Thy brother is dead;” and quoth
he in himself, “The accursed fellow cozeneth me, so he may get all
the coin for himself, but I will presently do with him what shall
soon re-quicken him.” Then he tare the bosom of his robe and bared
his head, weeping and saying, “Alas, my brother, ah! Alas, my
chief, ah! Alas, my lord, ah!” And he went in to the men,
who rose and condoled with him. Then he accosted the Rayy
man’s wife and said to her, “How came his death to occur?” Said
she, “I know nothing except that, when I arose in the morning, I
found him dead.” Moreover, he questioned her of the money which
was with her, but she cried, “I have no knowledge of this and no
tidings.” So he sat down at his fellow-sharper’s head, and said to
him, “Know, O Razi, that I will not leave thee till after ten days
with their nights, wherein I will wake and sleep by thy grave. So
rise and don’t be a fool.” But he answered him not, and the man
of Marw drew his knife and fell to sticking it into the other’s hands
and feet, purposing to make him move; but he stirred not and
he presently grew weary of this and determined that the sharper
was really dead. However, he still had his suspicions and said to
himself, “This fellow is falsing me, so he may enjoy all the money.”
Therewith he began to prepare the body for burial and bought
for it perfumes and whatso was needed. Then they brought him
to the washing-place and Al-Marwazi came to him; and, heating
water till it boiled and bubbled and a third of it was evaporated,
fell to pouring it on his skin, so that it turned bright red and
lively blue and was blistered; but he abode still on one case.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5527" id="noteref-5527" epub:type="noteref">5527</a>
Presently they wrapped him in the shroud and set him on the bier,
which they took up and bearing him to the burial-place, placed
him in the grave-niche and filled in the earth; after which the
folk dispersed. But the Marw man and the widow abode by the
tomb, weeping, and ceased not sitting till sundown, when the
woman said to him, “Come, let us hie us home, for this weeping
will not profit us, nor will it restore the dead.” He replied to her,
“By Allah, I will not budge hence till I have slept and waked by
this tomb ten days with their nights!” When she heard this his
speech, she feared lest he should keep his word and his oath, and
so her husband perish; but she said in her mind, “This one dis-sembleth:
an I leave him and return to my house, he will tarry by
him a little while and go away.” And Al-Marwazi said to her,
“Arise, thou, and hie thee home.” So she arose and repaired to
her house, whilst the man of Marw abode in his place till the night
was half spent, when he said to himself, “How long? Yet how
can I let this knavish dog die and lose the money? Better I
open the tomb on him and bring him forth and take my due of
him by dint of grievous beating and torment.” Accordingly, he
dug him up and pulled him forth of the grave; after which he
betook himself to a garden hard by the burial-ground and cut
thence staves and palm-fronds.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5528" id="noteref-5528" epub:type="noteref">5528</a> Then he tied the dead man’s
legs and laid on to him with the staff and beat him a grievous
beating; but the body never budged. When the time grew longsome
on him, his shoulders became a-weary and he feared lest
some one of the watch passing on his round should surprise and
seize him. So he took up Al-Razi and carrying him forth of the
cemetery, stayed not till he came to the Magians’ mortuary-place
and casting him down in a Tower of Silence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5529" id="noteref-5529" epub:type="noteref">5529</a> rained heavy blows
upon him till his shoulders failed him, but the other stirred not.
Then he seated him by his side and rested; after which he rose and
renewed the beating upon him; and thus he did till the end of the
night, but without making him move. Now, as Destiny decreed, a
band of robbers whose wont it was, when they had stolen anything,
to resort to that place and there divide their loot, came thither
in early-dawn, according to their custom; they numbered ten
and they had with them much wealth which they were carrying.
When they approached the Tower of Silence, they heard a noise
of blows within it and their captain cried, “This is a Magian whom
the Angels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5530" id="noteref-5530" epub:type="noteref">5530</a> are tormenting.” So they entered the cemetery and as
soon as they arrived over against him, the man of Marw feared lest
they should be the watchmen come upon him, therefore he fled
and stood among the tombs.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5531" id="noteref-5531" epub:type="noteref">5531</a> The robbers advanced to the place
and finding the man of Rayy bound by the feet and by him some
seventy sticks, wondered at this with exceeding wonder and said,
“Allah confound thee! This was a miscreant, a man of many
crimes; for earth hath rejected him from her womb, and by my
life, he is yet fresh! This is his first night in the tomb and the
Angels were tormenting him but now; so whoso of you hath
a sin upon his soul, let him beat him, by way of offering to
Almighty Allah.” The robbers said, “We be sinners one and
all;” so each of them went up to the corpse and dealt it
about an hundred blows, one saying the while, “This is for my
father!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5532" id="noteref-5532" epub:type="noteref">5532</a> and another laid on to him crying, “This is for my
grandfather!” whilst a third muttered, “This is for my brother!”
and a fourth exclaimed, “This is for my mother!” And they
gave not taking turns at him and beating him till they were
weary, whilst Al-Marwazi stood laughing and saying in himself,
“’Tis not I alone who have entered into default against him.
There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5533" id="noteref-5533" epub:type="noteref">5533</a> Then the robbers applied themselves to
sharing their loot wherein was a sword which caused them to fall
out anent the man who should take it. Quoth the Captain, “’Tis
my rede that we make proof of it; so, an it be a fine blade, we
shall know its worth, and if it be worthless we shall know that;”
whereto they said, “Try it on this corpse, for it is fresh.” So
the Captain took the sword and drawing it, brandished and made
a false cut with it; but, when the man of Rayy saw this, he
felt sure of death and said in his mind, “I have borne the washing-slab
and the boiling water and the pricking with the knife-point
and the grave-niche and its straitness and all this, trusting in
Allah that I might be delivered from death, and indeed I have
been delivered; but the sword I may not suffer seeing that one
stroke of it will make me a dead man.” So saying, he sprang to
his feet and seizing a thigh-bone of one departed, shouted at the
top of his voice, “O ye dead ones, take them to yourselves!”
And he smote one of them, whilst his mate of Marw smote
another and they cried out at them and buffeted them on their
neck-napes: whereupon the robbers left that which was with them
of loot and ran away; and indeed their wits took flight for terror
and they ceased not running till they came forth of the Magians
mortuary-ground and left it a parasang’s length behind them, when
they halted, trembling and affrighted for the muchness of that
which had befallen them of fear and awe of the dead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5534" id="noteref-5534" epub:type="noteref">5534</a> As for
Al-Razi and Al-Marwazi, they made peace each with other and
sat down to share the spoil. Quoth the man of Marw, “I will not
give thee a dirham of this money, till thou pay me my due of
the monies that be in thy house.” And quoth the man of Rayy,
“I will do naught of the kind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5535" id="noteref-5535" epub:type="noteref">5535</a> nor will I withdraw this from
aught of my due.” So they fell out thereupon and disputed each
with other and either of the twain went saying to his fellow, “I
will not give thee a dirham!” Wherefore words ran high between
them and the brawl was prolonged. Meanwhile, when the robbers
halted, one of them said to the others, “Let us go back and see;”
and the Captain said, “This thing is impossible of the dead:
never heard we that they came to life in such way. Return we
and take our monies, for that the dead have no need of money.”
And they were divided in opinion as to returning: but presently
one said, “Indeed, our weapons are gone and we may not prevail
against them and will not draw near the place: only let one of us
go look at it, and if he hear no sound of them, let him suggest
to us what we shall do.” At this they agreed that they should
send a man of them and assigned him for such mission two parts
of the plunder. Accordingly he returned to the burial-ground
and gave not over going till he stood at the door of the Tower of
Silence, when he heard the words of Al-Marwazi to his fellow,
“I will not give thee a single dirham of the money!” The other
said the same and they were occupied with brawling and abuse
and talk. So the robber returned in haste to his mates, who said,
“What is behind thee?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5536" id="noteref-5536" epub:type="noteref">5536</a> Quoth he, “Get you gone and run
for your lives, O fools, and save yourselves: much people of the
dead are come to life and between them are words and brawls.”
Hereat the robbers fled, whilst the two sharpers returned to the
man of Rayy’s house and made peace and added the robbers’ spoil
to the monies they had gained and lived a length of time. “Nor, O
king of the age” (continued the Wazir), “is this stranger or rarer
than the story of the Four Sharpers with the Shroff and the Ass.”
When the king heard this story, he smiled and it pleased him
and he bade the Minister to his own house.</p>

</div>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, King Shah Bakht summoned the
Wazir and required of him the hearing of the story. So Al-Rahwan
said, “Hearkening and obedience. Give ear, O King, to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE SHARPERS WITH THE SHROFF<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5537" id="noteref-5537" epub:type="noteref">5537</a> AND THE ASS</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">Four sharpers once plotted against a Shroff, a man of much
wealth, and agreed upon a sleight for securing some of his coins.
So one of them took an ass and laying on it a bag, wherein were
dirhams, lighted down at the shop of the Shroff and sought of him
small change. The man of monies brought out to him the silver
bits and bartered them with him, whilst the sharper was easy
with him in the matter of the exchange, so he might gar him long
for more gain. As they were thus, up came the other three
sharpers and surrounded the donkey; and one of them said, “’Tis
he,” and another said, “Wait till I look at him.” Then he took to
considering the ass and stroking him from crest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5538" id="noteref-5538" epub:type="noteref">5538</a> to tail; whilst
the third went up to him and handled him and felt him from
head to rump, saying, “Yes, ’tis in him.” Said another, “No,
’tis not in him;” and they left not doing the like of this for
some time. Then they accosted the donkey’s owner and chaffered
with him and he said, “I will not sell him but for ten
thousand dirhams.” They offered him a thousand dirhams; but
he refused and swore that he would not vend the ass but for that
which he had said. They ceased not adding to their offer till
the price reached five thousand dirhams, whilst their mate still
said, “I’ll not vend him save for ten thousand silver pieces.” The
Shroff advised him to sell, but he would not do this and said to
him, “Ho, Shaykh! Thou wottest not the case of this donkey.
Stick to silver and gold and what pertaineth thereto of exchange
and small change; because indeed the virtue of this ass is a mystery
to thee. For every craft its crafty men and for every means of
livelihood its peculiar people.” When the affair was prolonged
upon the three sharpers, they went away and sat down aside; then
they came up privily to the money-changer and said to him, “An
thou can buy him for us, do so, and we will give thee twenty dirhams.”
Quoth he, “Go away and sit down at a distance from
him.” So they did as he bade and the Shroff went up to the
owner of the ass and ceased not luring him with lucre and saying,
“Leave these wights and sell me the donkey, and I will
reckon him a present from thee,” till he sold him the animal for
five thousand and five hundred dirhams. Accordingly the money-changer
weighed out to him that sum of his own monies, and the
owner of the ass took the price and delivered the beast to him,
saying, “Whatso shall betide, though he abide a deposit upon thy
neck,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5539" id="noteref-5539" epub:type="noteref">5539</a> sell him not to yonder cheats for less than ten thousand
dirhams, for that they would fain buy him because of a hidden
hoard they know, whereto naught can guide them save this donkey.
So close thy hand on him and cross me not, or thou shalt repent.”
With these words he left him and went away, whereupon up came
the three other sharpers, the comrades of him of the ass, and said
to the Shroff, “God requite thee for us with good, in that thou
hast bought him! How can we reward thee?” Quoth he, “I will
not sell him but for ten thousand dirhams.” When they heard
that they returned to the ass and fell again to examining him like
buyers and handling him. Then said they to the money-changer,
“Indeed we were deceived in him. This is not the ass we sought
and he is not worth to us more than ten nusfs.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5540" id="noteref-5540" epub:type="noteref">5540</a> Then they
left him and offered to go away, whereat the Shroff was sore
chagrined and cried out at their speech, saying, “O folk, ye asked
me to buy him for you and now I have bought him, ye say, we
were deceived in him, and he is not worth to us more than ten
nusfs.” They replied, “We thought that in him was whatso we
wanted; but, behold, in him is the contrary of that which we wish;
and indeed he hath a blemish, for that he is short of back.” Then
they made long noses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5541" id="noteref-5541" epub:type="noteref">5541</a> at him and went away from him and dispersed.
The money-changer deemed they did but play him off,
that they might get the donkey at their own price; but, when
they walked away from him and he had long awaited their return,
he cried out, saying, “Well-away!” and “Ruin!” and “Sorry case
I am in!” and shrieked aloud and rent his raiment. So the
market-people assembled to him and questioned him of his case;
whereupon he acquainted them with his condition and told them
what the knaves had said and how they had cozened him and
how they had cajoled him into buying an ass worth fifty dirhams<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5542" id="noteref-5542" epub:type="noteref">5542</a>
for five thousand and five hundred.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5543" id="noteref-5543" epub:type="noteref">5543</a> His friends blamed him and
a gathering of the folk laughed at him and admired his folly
and over-faith in believing the talk of the sharpers without suspicion,
and meddling with that which he understood not and
thrusting himself into that whereof he had no sure knowledge.
“On this wise, O King Shah Bakht” (continued the Wazir), “is
the issue of greed for the goods of the world and indeed coveting
that which our knowledge containeth not shall lead to ruin and
repentance. Nor, O King of the age (added he), is this story stranger
than that of the Cheat and the Merchants.” When the King heard
these words, he said in himself, “Indeed, had I given ear to the
sayings of my courtiers and inclined to their idle prate in the
matter of my Minister, I had repented to the utterest of penitence,
but Alhamdolillah—laud be to the Lord—who hath disposed
me to endurance and long-suffering and hath vouchsafed to me
patience!” Then he turned to the Wazir and dismissed him
to his dwelling and gave congé those who were present,
according to his custom.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King summoned the Minister and
when he presented himself before him, he required of him the
hearing of the story. So he said, “Hearing and obeying. Give
ear, O illustrious lord, to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE CHEAT AND THE MERCHANTS</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once in olden time a certain Cheat, who could turn
the ear inside out by his talk, and he was a model of cleverness
and quick wit and skill and mischief. It was his wont to enter a
town and make a show of being a trader and engage in intimacy
with people of worth and sit in session with the merchants, for his
name was noted as a man of virtue and piety. Then he would
put a sleight on them and take of them what he might spend
and fare forth to another stead; and he ceased not to do thus
for a while of time. It chanced one day that he entered a certain
city and sold somewhat that was with him of merchandise and
made friends of the merchants of the place and took to sitting
with them and entertaining them and inviting them to his quarters
and his assembly, whilst they also invited him to their houses.
He abode after such fashion a long time until he was minded to
quit the city; and this was bruited among his intimates, who
grieved for parting from him. Then he betook himself to one of
them who was the richest in substance and the most conspicuous
for generosity, and sat with him and borrowed his goods; and
when rising to depart, he bade him return the deposit that he had
left with him. Quoth the merchant, “And what is the deposit?”
and quoth the Cheat, “’Tis such a purse, with the thousand dinars
therein.” The merchant asked, “And when didst thou give me
that same?” and the Cheat answered, “Extolled be Allah of All
Might! Was it not on such a day, by such a token which is thus
and thus?” The man rejoined, “I know naught of this,” and
words were bandied about between them, whilst the folk who
heard them disputed together concerning their sayings and
doings, till their voices rose high and the neighbours had knowledge
of that which passed between them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5544" id="noteref-5544" epub:type="noteref">5544</a> Then said the Cheat,
“O people, this is my friend and I deposited with him a deposit
which he denieth having received: so in whom shall men put trust
after this?” And they said, “This person is a man of worth and
we have known in him naught but trustiness and good faith and
the best of breeding, and he is endowed with sense and manliness.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5545" id="noteref-5545" epub:type="noteref">5545</a>
Indeed, he affirmeth no false claim, for that we have consorted
and associated with him and he with us and we know the sincerity
of his religion.” Then quoth one of them to the merchant,
“Ho, Such-an-one! Bethink thee of the past and refresh thy
memory. It cannot be that thou hast forgotten.” But quoth
he, “O people, I wot nothing of what he saith, for indeed he
deposited naught with me:” and the matter was prolonged
between them. Then said the Cheat to the merchant, “I am
about to travel and I have, praised be Allah Almighty, much
wealth, and this money shall not escape me; but do thou make
oath to me.” And the folk said, “Indeed, this man doth justice
upon himself.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5546" id="noteref-5546" epub:type="noteref">5546</a> Whereupon the merchant fell into that which
he disliked<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5547" id="noteref-5547" epub:type="noteref">5547</a> and came nigh upon loss and ill fame. Now he had
a friend, who pretended to sharpness and intelligence; so he
came up to him secretly and said to him, “Let me do so I may
cheat this Cheat, for I know him to be a liar and thou art near
upon having to weigh out the gold; but I will parry off suspicion
from thee and say to him, The deposit is with me and thou
erredst in suspecting that it was with other than myself; and so
I will divert him from thee.” The other replied, “Do so, and rid the
people of such pretended debts.” Accordingly the friend turned
to the Cheat and said to him, “O my lord, I am Such-an-one, and thou
goest under a delusion. The purse is with me, for it was with me
that thou depositedst it, and this Shaykh is innocent of it.” But
the Cheat answered him with impatience and impetuosity, saying,
“Extolled be Allah! As for the purse that is with thee, O noble
and faithful man, I know ’tis under Allah’s charge and my heart
is easy anent it, because ’tis with thee as it were with me;
but I began by demanding the purse which I deposited with this
man, of my knowledge that he coveteth the goods of folk.” At
this the friend was confounded and put to silence and returned
not a reply; and the only result of his meddling was that each
of them—merchant and friend—had to pay a thousand gold pieces.
So the Cheat took the two thousand dinars and made off; and
when he was gone, the merchant said to his friend, the man
of pretended sharpness and intelligence, “Ho, Such-an-one!
Thou and I are like the Falcon and the Locust.” The friend
asked, “What was their case?” and the merchant answered
with</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF THE FALCON AND THE LOCUST</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5548" id="noteref-5548" epub:type="noteref">5548</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once, of old time, a Falcon who made himself a nest
hard by the home of a Locust, and his neighbour gloried in such
neighbourhood and betaking herself to him, saluted him with the
salam and said, “O my lord and lord of all the birds, indeed the
nearness to thee delighteth me and thou honourest me with thy
vicinity and my soul is fortified with thee.” The Falcon thanked
her for this and friendship between them followed. One day, the
Locust said to the bird, “O prince of the flying race, how is it
that I see thee alone, solitary, having with thee no friend of thy
kind, the volatiles, on whom thou mayst repose in time of gladness
and of whom thou mayst seek aid in tide of sadness?
Indeed, ’tis said:—Man goeth about seeking ease of body and
ward of strength, and there is naught in this more necessary to
him than a true friend who shall be the crown of his comfort and
the column of his career and on whom shall be his dependence in
his distress and in his delight. Now I, although ardently desiring
thy weal in that which befitteth thy rank and degree, yet am
weak in that which the soul craveth; but, an thou deign give me
leave, I will seek out for thee one of the birds who shall fellow
thee in body and strength.” And the Falcon said, “I commit
this to thee and rely upon thee herein.” Thereupon, O my
brother (quoth the merchant), the Locust began going round the
company of the birds, but saw naught resembling the Falcon in
bulk and body save the Kite and thought well of her. So she
brought the twain together and counselled the Falcon to foregather
with the Kite. Presently it fortuned that the Falcon fell sick and
the Kite tarried with and tended him a long while till he recovered
and became sound and strong, wherefore he thanked her and
she fared from him. But after some days the Falcon’s sickness
returned to him and he needed succour of the Kite, so the Locust
went out from him and was absent from him a day; after which
she returned to him with another locust,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5549" id="noteref-5549" epub:type="noteref">5549</a> saying, “I have brought
thee this one.” When the Falcon saw her, he said, “God requite
thee with good! Indeed, thou hast done well in the quest and
thou hast shown subtlety and discrimination in the choice.” All
this, O my brother (continued the merchant) befel because the
Locust had no knowledge of the essence which lurketh in the
outer semblance of bodies. As for thee, O my brother, (Allah
requite thee with weal!) thou wast subtle in device and usedst
precaution, but forethought availeth not against Fate, and Fortune
foreordained baffleth force of fence. How excellent is the saying
of the poet when he spake these couplets:—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5550" id="noteref-5550" epub:type="noteref">5550</a></p>

or stranger than the story of the King and his Chamberlain’s
wife; nay, this is more wondrous than that and more delectable.”

<p class="c000">When it was night, the King summoned the Wazir and sought
of him the hearing of the story. Al-Rahwan replied, “Hearkening
and obedience! Listen, O august sovran, to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE KING AND HIS CHAMBERLAIN’S WIFE</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5551" id="noteref-5551" epub:type="noteref">5551</a></h3>

<p class="c013">There was once, in days of yore and in ages and times long
gone before, a King of the kings of the Persians, who was much
addicted to the love of fair women. His courtiers spoke him of
the wife of a certain of his Chamberlains, a model of beauty and
loveliness and perfect grace, and this egged him on to go in to her.
When she saw him, she knew him and said to him, “What urgeth
the King to this that he doeth?” and he replied, saying, “Verily, I
long for thee with excess of longing and there is no help but that
I enjoy thy favours.” And he gave her of wealth that after whose
like women lust; but she said, “I cannot do the deed whereof the
king speaketh, for fear of my husband;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5552" id="noteref-5552" epub:type="noteref">5552</a> and she refused herself
to him with the most rigorous of refusals and would not
suffer him to win his wish. So the king went out in wrath, and
forgot his girdle in the place. Now it chanced that her husband
entered immediately after his lord had departed, and saw the
girdle and knew it. He was aware of the king’s love for women;
so quoth he to his wife, “What be this I see with thee?” Quoth
she, “I’ll tell thee the truth,” and recounted to him the occurrence;
but he believed her not and suspicion entered his heart. As for the
King, he passed that night in care and concern, and when the morning
morrowed, he summoned that Chamberlain and made him
governor of one of his provinces; then he bade him betake himself
thither, purposing, after he should have departed and fared afar, to
foregather with his wife. The Chamberlain perceived his project and
kenned his intent; so he answered, saying, “To hear is to obey!”
presently adding, “I will go and order my affairs and give such
injunctions as may be needed for the well-doing of my affairs;
then will I go about the sovran’s commission.” And the King
said, “Do this and make haste.” So the Chamberlain went about
that which he needed and assembling his wife’s kinsfolk, said to
them, “I am determined to dismiss my wife.” They took this
ill of him and complained of him and summoning him before the
sovereign, sat prosecuting him. Now the King had no knowledge
of that which had passed; so he said to the Chamberlain, “Why
wilt thou put her away and how can thy soul consent to this and
why takest thou unto thyself a fine and fertile piece of land and
presently forsakest it?” Answered the husband, “Allah amend
the king! By the Almighty, O my King, I saw therein the trail of
the lion and fear to enter that land, lest the lion devour me, and
the like of my affair with her is that which befel between the
Crone and the Draper’s Wife.” The king asked, “What is their
adventure?” and the chamberlain answered, “Hear, O king,</p>

<h4 class="c014"><i>THE STORY OF THE CRONE AND THE DRAPER’S WIFE</i>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5553" id="noteref-5553" epub:type="noteref">5553</a></h4>

<p class="c013">There was once a man of the Drapers, who had a beautiful wife,
and she was curtained<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5554" id="noteref-5554" epub:type="noteref">5554</a> and chaste. A certain young man saw
her coming forth of the Hammam and loved her and his heart
was engrossed with her. So he devised for access to her all
manner of devices, but availed not to foregather with her; and
when he was a-weary and his patience failed for travail and trouble
and his fortitude betrayed and forsook him and he was at an end
of his resources against her, he complained of this to an ill-omened
crone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5555" id="noteref-5555" epub:type="noteref">5555</a> who promised him to bring about union between him and
his beloved. He thanked her for this and promised her all manner
of <i><span xml:lang="fr">douceurs</span></i>; and she said to him, “Hie thee to her husband and
buy of him a turband-cloth of fine linen, and let it be of the very
best of stuff.” So he repaired to the Draper and buying of him a
turband-cloth of lawn, returned and gave it to the old woman,
who took it and burned it in two places. Then she donned the
dress of a devotee and taking the turband-cloth with her, went to
the Draper’s house and knocked at the door. When the Draper’s
wife saw her thus habited as a holy woman, she opened to her
and admitted her with kindly reception, and made much of her
and welcomed her: so the crone went in to her and conversed
with her awhile. Then said she to her, “I want to make the
Wuzu-ablution preparatory to prayer.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5556" id="noteref-5556" epub:type="noteref">5556</a> At these words the wife
brought the water and she made the ablution and standing up to
pray, prayed and satisfied herself; and when she had ended her
orisons, she left the turband-cloth in the place of prayer and fared
forth. Presently, in came the Draper, at the hour of night-devotions,
and sitting down in the prayer-place where the old woman
had prayed, looked about him and espied the turband. He knew
it and suspected foul play; so wrath showed in his face and he
was furious with his wife and reviled her and abode his day and
his night without speaking to her, during all which while she
knew not the cause of his rage. Then she looked and seeing the
turband-cloth before him and noting the traces of burning thereon,
understood that his anger was on account of this and concluded
that he was in ill-temper because it was burnt. When the morning
morrowed, the Draper went out, still wroth with his wife, and the
crone returned to her and found her changed of colour, pale of
complexion, dejected and heart-broken. So she questioned her of
the cause, and the wife told her how her husband was angered
against her on account of the burns in the turband-cloth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5557" id="noteref-5557" epub:type="noteref">5557</a> Rejoined
the old woman, “O my daughter, be not chagrined; for
I have a son, a fine-drawer, and he, by thy life, shall fine-draw
the holes and restore the turband-cloth as it was.” The wife
rejoiced in her saying and asked her, “And when shall this
be?” The crone answered, “To-morrow, Inshallah—an it please
Allah the Most High—I will bring him to thee, at the time
of thy husband’s going forth from thee, and he shall fine-draw
it and depart forthwith.” Then she comforted her heart
and going away from her, returned to the young man and
acquainted him with what had passed. Now when the Draper saw
the turband-cloth, he determined to divorce his wife and waited
only till he could collect that which was obligatory on him of the
contingent dowry and what not else,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5558" id="noteref-5558" epub:type="noteref">5558</a> for fear of her people. When
the crone arose in the morning, she took the young man and
carried him into the Draper’s house. The wife opened the door to
her and the ill-omened old woman entered with him and said
to the lady, “Go, fetch that which thou wouldest have fine-drawn
and give it to my son.” So saying, she bolted the door on her,
whereupon the young man raped<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5559" id="noteref-5559" epub:type="noteref">5559</a> her against her will and did his
want of her and went forth. Then cried the crone, “Know that
this is my son and that he loved thee with exceeding love and
was like to lose his life for longing after thee; so I devised for
thee with this device and came to thee with this turband-cloth,
which is not thy husband’s, but my son’s. Now have I won to my
wish; so do thou trust in me and I will put a sleight on thy
husband for setting thee right with him, and thou wilt be subject
to me and to him and to my son.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5560" id="noteref-5560" epub:type="noteref">5560</a> And the wife replied, “’Tis
well. Do so.” Presently the old woman returned to the lover and
said, “Know thou that I have engineered the affair for thee with
her; and now we must mend that we have marred. Hie thee
and sit with the Draper and mention to him the turband-cloth,
saying, The turband I bought of thee I chanced to burn in two
places; so I gave it to a certain old woman, to have fine-drawn,
and she took it and went away, and I know not her dwelling-place.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5561" id="noteref-5561" epub:type="noteref">5561</a>
When thou seest me pass by, rise and lay hold of
me, and demand of me the cloth, to the intent that I may
arrange her affair with her spouse and that matters go right with
thee in her regard.” Accordingly he repaired to the Draper’s
shop and sat down by him and asked him, “Thou knowest the
turband-cloth I bought of thee?” “Yes.” “Knowest thou what
is come of it?” “No.” “After I bought it of thee, I fumigated
myself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5562" id="noteref-5562" epub:type="noteref">5562</a> and it fortuned that the turband-cloth was burnt in two
places; so I gave it to a woman, whose son, they said, was a fine-drawer,
and she took it and fared forth with it; and I know not
her home.” When the Draper heard this, he was startled by the
thought that he had suspected his wife wrongfully, and marvelled
at the story of the turband-cloth, and his mind was made easy
anent her. After a short while, up came the old woman, whereupon
the young man sprang to his feet and seizing her, demanded
of her the turband-cloth. Said she, “Know that I entered one
of the houses and wuzu’d and prayed in the prayer-place;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5563" id="noteref-5563" epub:type="noteref">5563</a> and I
forgot the turband-cloth there and went out. Now I weet not
the house in which I prayed, nor have I been divinely directed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5564" id="noteref-5564" epub:type="noteref">5564</a>
thereto, and I go round about every day till the night, so haply I
may light on the dwelling, for I know not its owner.” When the
Draper heard these words, he said to the old woman, “Verily,
Allah restoreth to thee what thing thou hast lost. Be gladdened by
good news, for the turband-cloth is with me and in my house.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5565" id="noteref-5565" epub:type="noteref">5565</a> And
he arose forthright and handed to her the turband-cloth, as it was,
and she handed it to the young man. Then the Draper made
peace with his wife and gave her raiment and jewellery, till she
was content and her heart was appeased. When the king
heard his Chamberlain’s story, he was dazed and amazed and said
to him, “Abide on thy service and ear thy field for that the lion
entered it, but marred it not, and he will never more return thither.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5566" id="noteref-5566" epub:type="noteref">5566</a>
Then he bestowed on him an honourable robe and made him a
costly present; and the man returned to his wife and people,
rejoicing, his heart having been set at rest concerning his wife.
“Nor” (continued the Wazir), “O King of the age, is this rarer
or stranger than the story of the beautiful wife, a woman gifted
of amorous grace, with the ugly Man, her husband.” When king
Shah Bakht heard the Minister’s speech, he deemed it delectable
and it pleased him; so he bade him hie to his house, and there he
tarried his day long.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King summoned his Wazir and
bade him tell the tale. So he said, “’Tis well. Hear, O King,</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE UGLY MAN AND HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once a man of the Arabs who had a number of
children, and amongst them a boy, never was seen a fairer than
he of favour nor a more complete in comeliness; no, nor a more
perfect of prudence. When he came to man’s estate, his father
married him to his first cousin, the daughter of one of his paternal
uncles, and she excelled not in beauty, neither was she laudable
for qualities; wherefore she pleased not the youth, but he bore
with her for the sake of kinship. One day, he fared forth in
quest of certain camels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5567" id="noteref-5567" epub:type="noteref">5567</a> of his which had strayed and hied him on
all his day and night till eventide, when he was fain to seek
hospitality in an Arab camp. So he alighted at one of
the tents of the tribesmen and there came forth to him a man
short of stature and foul of favour, who saluted him with the
salam; and, lodging him in a corner of the tent, sat entertaining
him with chat, the cheeriest that might be. When his food was
dressed, the Arab’s wife brought it to the guest, and he looked at
the mistress of the tent and saw a semblance than which no
seemlier might be. Indeed, her beauty and loveliness, her
symmetry and perfect grace amazed him and he was struck with
astonishment, gazing now at her and then at her mate. When
his looking grew long, the man said to him, “Ho, thou son of
the worthy! Busy thyself with thine own business, for by me and
this woman hangeth a wondrous tale, which is even better than that
thou seest of her beauty; and I will tell it to thee when we have
made a finish of our food.” So, when they had ended eating
and drinking, the young man asked his host for the story, and
he said:—Know that in my youth I was the same as thou seest
me in the matter of loathliness and foul favour; and I had
brethren of the fairest of the folk; wherefore my father preferred
them over me and used to show them kindness, to my exclusion,
and made me serve in their stead, like as a master employeth
slaves. One day, a dromedary of his strayed from the herd of
camels, and he said to me, “Go thou forth in quest of her and
return not but with her.” I replied, “Send other than I of thy
sons.” But he would not consent to this and scolded me and
insisted upon me, till the matter came to such a pass with him
that he took a thong-whip and fell to beating me. So I arose and
saddling a riding-camel, mounted her and sallied forth at random,
purposing to go out into the wolds and the wilds and return to
him never more. I fared on all my night and the next day and
coming at eventide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5568" id="noteref-5568" epub:type="noteref">5568</a> to the encampment of this my wife’s people,
alighted down with and became the guest of her father, who was
a Shaykh well stricken in years. Now when it was the noon of
night, I arose and went forth the tent at a call of nature, and
none knew of my case save this woman. The dogs followed me
as a suspected stranger and ceased not worrying me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5569" id="noteref-5569" epub:type="noteref">5569</a> till I fell on
my back into a pit, wherein was water, a deep hollow and a steep;
and a dog of those dogs fell in with me. The woman, who was then
a girl in the bloom of youth, full of strength and spirit, was moved
to ruth on me, for the calamity whereinto I was fallen, and coming
to me with a rope, said to me, “Catch hold of the rope.” So I
hent it and clung to it and she haled me up; but, when I was
half-way up, I pulled her down and she fell with me into the pit;
and there we abode three days, she and I and the hound. When
her people arose in the morning and did not see her, they sought
her in the camp, but, finding her not and missing me also, never
doubted but she had fled with me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5570" id="noteref-5570" epub:type="noteref">5570</a> Now she had four brothers,
as they were Saker-hawks, and they took horse and dispersed in
search of us. When the day yellowed on the fourth dawn, the dog
began to bark and the other hounds answered him and coming to
the mouth of the pit, stood howling to him. The Shaykh, my
wife’s father, hearing the howling of the hounds, came up and
standing at the brink of the hollow, looked in and beheld a
marvel. Now he was a brave man and a sensible, an elder
experienced in affairs, so he fetched a cord and bringing forth the
three, questioned us twain of our case. I told him all that had
betided and he fell a-pondering the affair. Presently, her brothers
returned, whereupon the old man acquainted them with the whole
case and said to them, “O my sons, know that your sister intended
not aught but good, and if ye kill this man, ye will earn abiding
shame and ye will wrong him, and wrong your own souls and eke
your sister: for indeed there appeareth no cause such as calleth for
killing, and it may not be denied that this accident is a thing
whose like may well occur and that he may easily have been the
victim of suchlike chance.” Then he addressed me and questioned
me of my lineage; so I set forth to him my genealogy
and he, exclaiming, “A man of her match, honourable, understanding,
offered me his daughter in wedlock. I consented to
this and marrying her, took up my abode with him and Allah
hath opened on me the gates of weal and wealth, so that I am
become the richest in monies of the tribesmen; and the Almighty
hath stablished me in that which He hath given me of His
bounties.” The young man marvelled at his tale and lay the
night with him; and when he arose in the morning, he found his
estrays. So he took them and returning to his folk, acquainted
them with what he had seen and all that had befallen him.
“Nor” (continued the Wazir) “is this stranger or rarer than the
story of the King who lost kingdom and wealth and wife and
children and Allah restored them to him and requited him with a
realm more magnificent than that which he had forfeited and
better and finer and greater of wealth and degree.” The
Minister’s story pleased the King and he bade him depart to his
abode.</p>

<p class="c013">There was once a king of the kings of Hind, who was a model of
morals, praiseworthy in policy, lief of justice to his lieges, lavish to
men of learning and piety and abstinence and devoutness and worship
and shunning mischief-makers and froward folk, fools and traitors.
After such goodly fashion he abode in his kingship what Allah the
Most High willed of watches and days and twelvemonths,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5572" id="noteref-5572" epub:type="noteref">5572</a> and he
married the daughter of his father’s brother, a beautiful woman and
a winsome, endowed with brightness and perfection, who had been
reared in the king’s house in delicacy and delight. She bare him
two sons, the most beauteous that might be of boys, when came
Destiny from whose decree is no deliverance and Allah the Most
High raised up against the King another king, who came forth
upon his realm, and was joined by all the folk of the city that
had a mind to lewdness and frowardness. So he strengthened
himself by means of them against the King and compassed his
kingdom, routing his troops and killing his guards. The King
took his wife, the mother of his sons, and what he might of monies
and saved his life and fled in the darkness of the night,
unknowing whither he should wend. Whenas wayfare grew sore
upon them, there met them highwaymen on the way, who took
all that was with them, so that naught remained to each of them
save a shirt and trousers; the robbers left them without even
provaunt or camels or other riding-cattle, and they ceased not to
fare on afoot, till they came to a copse, which was an orchard of
trees on the ocean shore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5573" id="noteref-5573" epub:type="noteref">5573</a> Now the road which they would have
followed was crossed by a sea-arm, but it was shallow and scant of
water; wherefore, when they reached that place, the king took up
one of his children and fording the water with him, set him down
on the further bank and returned for his other son, whom also he
seated by his brother. Lastly, returning for their mother, he took
her up and passing the water with her, came to the place where he
had left his children, but found them not. Thereupon he looked
at the midst of the island and saw an old man and an old woman,
engaged in making themselves a reed-hut: so he set down his wife
over against them and started off in quest of his children, but none
gave him news of them and he went round about right and left, yet
found not the whereabouts they were. On this wise fared it with
him; but as to the children, they had entered the copse to make
water, and they found there a forest of trees, wherein, if a sturdy
horseman<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5574" id="noteref-5574" epub:type="noteref">5574</a> strayed, he might wander by the week, and never know
its first from its last. So the boys pushed into it and wotted not
how they should return and went astray in that wood, for a
purpose willed of Allah Almighty, whilst their father sought
them, but found them not. So he returned to their mother and
they abode weeping for their children; as for whom, when they
entered the forest, it swallowed them up and they fared at hap-hazard,
wandering in it many days, knowing not whence they came
or whither they went, till they issued forth, at another side, upon the
open country. Meanwhile, their parents, the king and queen,
tarried in the island, over against the old man and his old woman,
and ate of the fruits and drank of the rills that were in it till,
one day of the days, as they sat, behold, up came a ship and
made fast to the island-side, for provisioning with water, whereupon
they<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5575" id="noteref-5575" epub:type="noteref">5575</a> looked one at other and spoke. The master of the craft
was a Magian man and all that was therein, both crew and goods,
belonged to him, for he was a trader and went round about the
world. Now greed of gain deluded the old man, the owner of
the island, and he fared to the ship and gave the Guebre news
of the King’s wife, setting out to him her charms, till he made him
long for her and his soul moved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5576" id="noteref-5576" epub:type="noteref">5576</a> him to practise treachery and
cozenage upon her and take her from her husband. Accordingly,
he sent to her, saying, “Aboard with us is a woman with child,
and we dread lest she be delivered this night: hast thou aught of
skill in midwifery?” She replied, “Yes.” Now it was the last of
the day; so he sent to her to come up into the ship and deliver
the woman, for that the labour-pangs were come upon her; and
he promised her clothes and spending-money. Hereat, she
embarked confidently, with heart at ease for herself, and transported
her gear to the ship; but no sooner had she come thither
than the sails were hoisted and the canvas was loosed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5577" id="noteref-5577" epub:type="noteref">5577</a> and the
ship set sail. When the King saw this, he cried out and his wife
wept in the ship and would have cast herself into the waves; but
the Magian bade his men lay hands on her. So they seized her
and it was but a little while ere the night darkened and the ship
vanished from the King’s eyes; whereupon he fainted away
for excess of weeping and lamentation and passed his night
bewailing his wife and his children. And when the morning
morrowed he began improvising these couplets:—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5578" id="noteref-5578" epub:type="noteref">5578</a></p>

<p class="c000">He sat weeping for the severance of his wife and children till the
morning, when he went forth wandering at a venture, unweeting
what he should do, and ceased not walking along the sea-shore days
and nights, unknowing whither he went and taking no food save
the herbs of the earth and seeing neither man nor wildling nor
other living thing, till his wayfare brought him to a mountain-top.
He sojourned in the highland and abode awhile, there
alone, eating of its fruits and drinking of its founts; then he
came down thence and trudged along the high road three days,
when he hit upon tilled fields and villages and gave not over
going till he made a great city on the shore of the salt sea and
came to its gate at the last of the day. The gatekeepers allowed
him no admission; so he spent his night anhungered, and when
he arose in the morning, he sat down hard by the portal. Now
the king of the city was dead and had left no son, and the
citizens fell out anent who should be ruler over them: and their
words and redes differed, so that civil war was like to befal them
thereupon. But it came to pass that, after long jangle, they
agreed to leave the choice to the late king’s elephant and that
he unto whom he consented should be king and that they would
not contest with him the sway. So to this they sware and on
the morrow, they brought out their elephant and fared forth
to a site within sight of the city; nor was there man or woman
but was present at that moment. Then they adorned the
elephant and raising the throne on his back, gave him the
crown in his trunk; and he went round about examining the
countenances of the folk, but stopped not over against any of
them till he came at last to the forlorn King, the exile who had
lost his children and his wife, when the beast prostrated himself
to him and placing the crown on his head, took him up and
set him upon his back. Thereupon the people all prostrated
themselves and gave mutual joy of this and the drums<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5579" id="noteref-5579" epub:type="noteref">5579</a> of
good tidings beat before him, and he entered the city and
went on till he reached the House of Justice and the Audience-hall
of the Palace and sat down upon the throne of the kingdom,
crown on head; whereat the lieges entered to congratulate him
and to bless him. Then he addressed himself, as was his wont
in the kingship, to forwarding the affairs of the folk and ranging
the troops according to their ranks and looking into their affairs
and those of all the Ryots. He also released those who were in
the dungeons and abolished the custom-dues and gave honourable
robes and lavished great gifts and bestowed largesse and conferred
favours on the Emirs and Wazirs and Lords of the realm, and the
Chamberlains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5580" id="noteref-5580" epub:type="noteref">5580</a> and Nabobs presented themselves before him and
did him homage. So the city people rejoiced in him and said,
“Indeed, this be none other than a King of the greatest of the
kings.” And presently he assembled the sages and the theologians
and the sons of the Sovrans and conversed with them and
asked them subtile questions and casuistical problems and talked
over with them things manifold of all fashions that might direct
him to rectitude in the kingship; and he questioned them also
of mysteries and religious obligations and of the laws of the
land and the regulations of rule and of that which it beseemeth
the liege lord to do of looking into the affairs of the lieges and
repelling the foe and fending off his malice with force and fight;
so the subjects’ contentment redoubled and their exultation
in that which Allah Almighty had vouchsafed them of his
kingship over them. On such wise he upheld the ordinance
of the realm, and the affairs abode stablished upon the accepted
custom and local usage. Now the late king had left a wife
and two daughters, and the people would fain have married the
Princess royal to the new king that the rule might not pass clean
away from the old rulers. Accordingly, they proposed to him
that he should wed her or the other of the deceased king’s
daughters, and he promised them this, but put them off from him,
of his respect for the covenant he had made with his former
wife, his cousin, that he would marry none other than herself.
Then he betook himself to fasting by day and praying through
the night, multiplying his almsdeeds and beseeching Allah
(extolled and exalted be He!) to reunite him with his children
and his wife, the daughter of his father’s brother. When a year
had elapsed, there came to the city a ship, wherein were many
merchants and much merchandise. Now it was their custom
from time immemorial that the king, whenever a ship made the
port, sent to it such of his pages as he trusted in, who took agency
of the goods, to the end that they might be first shown to the Sovran,
who bought as much of them as befitted him and gave the merchants
leave to sell whatso he wanted not. So he commissioned, according
to his custom, a man who should fare to the ship and seal
up the bales and set over them one who could watch and
ward them. Meanwhile the Queen his wife, when the Magian
fled with her and proffered himself to her and lavished upon
her abounding wealth, rejected him and was like to kill herself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5581" id="noteref-5581" epub:type="noteref">5581</a>
for chagrin at that which had befallen and for concern
anent her separation from her husband. She also refused meat
and drink and resolved to cast herself into the sea; but the
Magian chained her and straitened her and clothed her in a coat
of wool and said to her, “I will continue thee in wretchedness
and humiliation till thou obey me and accept me.” So she took
patience and looked for the Almighty to deliver her from the
hand of that accursed; and she ceased not travelling with him
from country to country till he came with her in fine to the
city wherein her husband was king and his goods were put under
seal. Now the woman was in a chest and two youths of the
late king’s pages, who were now in the new King’s service, were
those who had been charged with the watch and ward of the
craft and her cargaison. When the evening evened on them,
the twain began talking and recounted that which had befallen
them in their days of childhood and the manner of the faring
forth of their father and mother from their country and kingdom
when the wicked overcame their realm, and how they had gone
astray in the forest and how Fate had severed them from their
parents; for short, they told their tale from first to last. When
the woman heard their talk, she knew that they were her sons
and cried out to them from the chest, “I am your mother, Such-an-one,
and the token between you twain and me is thus and
thus.” The young men knew the token and falling upon the
chest, brake the lock and brought out their mother, who seeing
them, strained them to her bosom, and they fell upon her and
fainted away, all three. When they came to themselves, they
wept awhile and the people assembled about them, marvelling
at that they saw, and questioned them of their case. So the
young Princes vied each with other who should be the first to
discover the story to the folk; and when the Magian saw this,
he came up, crying out, “Alack!” and “Ruin!” and said to
them, “Why and wherefore have ye broken open my chest?
Verily, I had in it jewels and ye have stolen them, and this
damsel is my slave-girl and she hath agreed with you both upon
a device to take my wealth.” Then he rent his raiment and cried
for aid, saying, “I appeal to Allah and to the just King, so he may
quit me of these wrongous youths!” They both replied, “This is
our mother and thou stolest her:” whereupon words waxed manifold
between them and the folk plunged into talk with many a “he
said” and “’twas said” concerning their affair and that of the
pretended slave-girl, and the strife increased between them, so
that at last they carried them all four to the King’s court.
When the two young men presented themselves between his
hands and stated their case to him and to the folk and the
sovran heard their speech, he knew them and his heart was like
to fly for joy: the tears poured from his eyes at their sight
and the sight of his wife, and he thanked Allah Almighty and
praised Him for that He had deigned reunite them. Then he bade
the folk who were present about him be dismissed and commanded
the Magian and the woman and the two youths be to morrow
committed to his armoury<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5582" id="noteref-5582" epub:type="noteref">5582</a> for the night, ordering that they should
keep guard over them all until the Lord should make the morning
to morrow, so he might assemble the Kazis and the Justiciaries
and Assessors and determine between them, according to Holy
Law, in the presence of the four judges. So they did this and
the King passed the night praying and praising Allah of All-might
for that which he had vouchsafed him of kingship and power and
victory over the wight who had wronged him and thanking Him
who had reunited him with his own. When the morning morrowed,
he assembled the Kazis and Deputies and Assessors<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5583" id="noteref-5583" epub:type="noteref">5583</a> and
summoning the Magian and the two youths and their mother,
questioned them of their case; whereupon the two young men
began and said, “We are the sons of King Such-an-one and
foemen and lewd fellows gat the mastery of our realm; so our
sire fled forth with us and wandered at hap-hazard, for fear of
the foe.” And they recounted to him all that had betided them,
from beginning to end.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5584" id="noteref-5584" epub:type="noteref">5584</a> Quoth he, “Ye tell a marvel-tale; but
what hath Fate done with your father?” Quoth they, “We
know not how Fortune dealt with him after our loss.” And he
was silent. Then he bespake the woman, “And thou, what
sayst thou?” So she set forth to him her case and all that
had betided her and her husband, from the beginning of their
hardships to the end, and recounted to him their adventures up
to the time when they took up their abode with the old man
and woman who dwelt on the sea-shore. Then she reported
that which the Magian had practised on her of fraud and how he
had carried her off in the craft and everything that had betided
her of humiliation and torment; all this while the Kazis and
Judges and Deputies hearkening to her speech as they had lent
ear to the others’ adventures. When the King heard the last
of his wife’s tale, he said, “Verily, there hath betided thee a
mighty grievous matter; but hast thou knowledge of what thy
husband did and what came of his affair?” She replied, “Nay,
by Allah; I have no knowledge of him, save that I leave him
no hour unremembered in righteous prayer, and never, whilst
I live, will he cease to be to me the father of my children and
my cousin and my flesh and my blood.” Then she wept and
the King bowed his head, whilst his eyes welled tears at her
tale. Presently he raised his head to the Magian and cried to
him, “Say thy say, thou also.” So the Magian replied, “This is
my slave-girl, whom I bought with my money from such a land
and for so many dinars, and I made her my betrothed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5585" id="noteref-5585" epub:type="noteref">5585</a> and
loved her exceedingly and gave my monies into her charge;
but she falsed me in my substance and plotted with one of my
lads to slay me, tempting him by a promise that she would kill
me and become his wife. When I knew this of her and was
assured that she purposed treason against me, I awoke from my
dream of happiness and did with her that which I did, fearing
for my life from her craft and perfidy; for indeed she is a
trickstress with her tongue and she hath taught these two
youths this pretence, by way of sleight and of her guile and
her malice: so be you not deluded by her and by her talk.”
“Thou liest, O accursed,” cried the King and bade lay
hands on him and iron him. Then he turned to the two
youths, his sons, and strained them to his breast, weeping sore
and saying, “O all ye people who are present of Kazis and
Assessors and Lords of the land, know that these twain are my
sons and that this is my wife and the daughter of my father’s
brother; for that whilome I was king in such a realm.” And
he recounted to them his history from commencement to conclusion,
nor is there aught of fruition in repetition; whereupon
the folk cried out with weeping and wailing for the stress of
what they heard of marvellous chances and that wondrous story.
As for the king’s wife, he bade carry her into his palace and
lavished upon her and upon her sons all that befitted and beseemed
them of bounties, whilst the lieges flocked to offer up
prayers for him and give him joy of his reunion with his wife
and children. When they had made an end of blessings and
congratulations, they besought the king to hasten the punishment
of the Magian and heal their hearts with tormenting and abasing
him. So he appointed them for a day on which they should
assemble to witness his requitement and that which should betide
him of torment, and shut himself up with his wife and two sons
and abode thus private with them three days, during which they
were veiled from the folk. On the fourth day the King entered
the Hammam, and faring forth, sat down on the throne of his
kingship, crown on head, whereupon the folk came in to him,
according to their custom and after the measure of their several
dignities and degrees, and the Emirs and Wazirs entered, and eke
the Chamberlains and Nabobs and Captains of war and the
Falconers and Armbearers and Commanders of the body-guard.
Then he seated his two sons, one on his right and the other on his
left hand, whilst the subjects all stood before him and lifted up
their voices in thanksgiving to Allah the Most High and glorification
of Him and were instant in orisons for the king and in setting
forth his virtues and excellent qualities. He answered them with
the most gracious of answers and bade carry the Magian outside
the city and set him on a high scaffold which had been builded for
him there; and he said to the folk, “Behold, I will torture him
with torments of all kinds and fashions.” Then he began telling
them that which he had wrought of villainy with his cousin-wife
and what he had caused her of severance between her and her
husband and how he had required her of her person, but she
had sought refuge for her chastity against him with Allah (to
whom belong honour and glory) and chose abasement rather than
obedience to him, despite stress of torture: neither recked she
aught of that which he lavished to her of monies and raiment,
jewels and ornaments. When the King had made an end of his
story, he bade the bystanders spit in the Magian’s face and curse
him; and they did this. Then he bade cut out his tongue and on
the next day he bade lop off his ears and nose and pluck out
both his eyes. On the third day he bade hew off his hands
and on the fourth his feet; and they ceased not to dismember
him, limb after limb, and each member they cast into the fire,
after its amputation, before his face, till his soul departed, after
he had endured torments of all kinds and fashions. Then the
King bade crucify his trunk on the city wall for three days; after
which he gave orders to burn it and reduce its ashes to powder
and scatter them abroad in air. And when this was done, the King
summoned the Kazi and the Witnesses and commanded them
marry the old king’s daughter and her sister to his own sons; so
the youths wedded them, after the King had made a bride-feast
three days and displayed their brides to them from nightfall to
day-dawn. Then the two Princes went in unto their brides and
abated their maidenheads and loved them and were vouchsafed
issue by them. As for the King their sire, he abode with
his cousin-wife, their mother, what while Allah (to whom be
honour and glory) willed, and they rejoiced in reunion each with
other. The kingship endured unto them and high degree and
victory, and the sovran continued to rule with justice and equity,
so that the lieges loved him and prayed for him and for his sons
length of life and durance of days; and they lived the most
delightsome of existences till there came to them the Destroyer of
delights and Severer of societies, the Depopulator of palaces and
Garnerer of graves; and this is all that hath come down to us of
the story of the King and his Wife and Sons. “Nor,” continued
the Wazir, “if this story be a solace and a diversion, is it pleasanter
or more diverting than the tale of the Youth of Khorasan
and his mother and sister.” When King Shah Bakht heard this
story, it pleased him and he bade the Minister hie away to his
own house.</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF SALIM, THE YOUTH OF KHORASAN AND SALMA, HIS SISTER</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">Know, O king (but Allah alone knoweth His secret purpose and
is versed in the past and the foredone among folk bygone) that
there was once, in the parts of Khorasan, a man of its affluent,
who was a merchant of the chiefest of the merchants<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5586" id="noteref-5586" epub:type="noteref">5586</a> and was
blessed with two children, a son and a daughter.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5587" id="noteref-5587" epub:type="noteref">5587</a> He was diligent
exceedingly in rearing them and they were educated with the
fairest of education; for he used to teach the boy, who taught his
sister all that he learnt, so that, by means of her brother, the
damsel became perfect in the knowledge of the Traditions of the
Prophet and in polite letters. Now the boy’s name was Salím and
that of the girl Salmá. When they grew up and were fully grown,
their father built them a mansion beside his own and lodged them
apart therein and appointed them slave-girls and servants to tend
them and assigned to each of them pay and allowances and all that
they needed of high and low; meat and bread; wine, dresses, and
vessels and what not else. So Salim and Salma abode in that palace,
as they were one soul in two bodies, and they used to sleep on one
couch and rise amorn with single purpose, while firmly fixed in each
one’s heart were fond affection and familiar friendship for the other.
One night, when the half was spent, as Salim and Salma sat recounting
and conversing, they heard a noise on the ground floor; so they
looked out from a latticed casement which gave upon the gate of
their father’s mansion and saw a man of fine presence, whose clothes
were hidden under a wide cloak. He came straight up to the gate
and laying hold of the door-ring, rapped a light rap; whereupon
the door opened and behold, out came their sister, with a lighted
taper, and after her their mother, who saluted the stranger and
embraced him, saying, “O dearling of my heart and light of mine
eyes and fruit of my vitals, enter.” So he went in and shut
the door, whilst Salim and Salma abode amazed. The youth
turned to the girl and said to her, “O sister mine, how deemest
thou of this trouble and what advice hast thou to offer?” She
replied, “O my brother, indeed I know not what I shall say anent
the like of this; but he is not disappointed who divine direction
seeketh, nor doth he repent who counsel taketh. One getteth not
the better of the traces of burning by haste, and know that this is
an affliction that hath descended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5588" id="noteref-5588" epub:type="noteref">5588</a> on us and a calamity foreordained
to us; so we have need of wise rede to do it away and
contrivance which shall wash our shame from our faces.” And
they ceased not watching the gate till daybreak, when the young
man opened the door and their mother farewelled him; after which
he went his way and she entered, she and her hand-maid. Hereat
said Salim to his sister, “Know thou I am resolved to slay this
man, an he return the next night, and I will say to the folk, He
was a robber, and none shall weet that which hath befallen. Then
I will address myself to the slaughter of whosoever knoweth what
is between the fellow and my mother.” But Salma said, “I fear
lest an thou slay him in our dwelling-place and he be not
convicted of robber-hood, suspicion and ill-fame will revert upon
ourselves, and we cannot be assured that he belongeth not to a
tribe whose mischief is to be feared and whose enmity is to be
dreaded, and thus wilt thou have fled from hidden shame to open
shame and to disgrace public and abiding.” Asked Salim: “What
then is it thy rede to do?” And she answered, “Is there no
help but thou kill him? Let us not hasten unto slaughter, for that
the slaughter of a soul without just cause is a mighty grave
matter.” When Shahbán<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5589" id="noteref-5589" epub:type="noteref">5589</a> heard this, he said within himself, “By
Allah, I have indeed been hasty and reckless in the slaying of
women and girls, and Alhamdolillah—lauded be the Lord—who
hath occupied me with this damsel from the slaughter of souls,
for that the slaughter of souls is a grave matter and a grievous!
By the Almighty if Shah Bakht spare the Wazir, I will assuredly
spare Sháhrázád!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5590" id="noteref-5590" epub:type="noteref">5590</a> Then he gave ear to the story and heard her
say to her sister:—Quoth Salma to Salim, “Hasten not to slay him,
but overthink the matter and consider the issue whereto it may
tend; for whoso considereth not of actions the end hath not
Fortune to friend.” Then they arose on the morrow and busied
themselves with contriving how they should turn away their parent
from that man, and the mother forefelt mischief from them, for what
she saw in their eyes of change, she being wily and keen of wit.
So she took precaution for herself against her children and Salma
said to Salim, “Thou seest what we have fallen upon through
this woman, and very sooth she hath sensed our purpose and
wotteth that we have discovered her secret. So, doubtless, she
will plot against us the like of that which we plot for her; for
indeed up to now she had concealed her affair, and from this time
forth she will become harsh to us; wherefore, methinks, there is a
thing forewritten to us, whereof Allah (extolled and exalted be
He!) knew in His foreknowledge and wherein He carrieth out His
commandments.” He asked, “What is that?” and she answered,
“It is that we arise, I and thou, and go forth this night from this
land and seek us a town wherein we may wone and witness naught
of the doings of yonder traitress; for whoso is absent from the
eye is absent from the heart, and quoth one of the poets in the
following couplet:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5591" id="noteref-5591" epub:type="noteref">5591</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">’Tis happiest, best for thee, the place to leave, ✿ For then no eye can see, nor heart can grieve.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth Salim to her,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5592" id="noteref-5592" epub:type="noteref">5592</a> “Tis for thee to decide and right is thy
rede; so let us do this, in the name of Allah the Almighty, trusting
in Him for guiding and grace.” Accordingly they arose and took the
richest of their raiment and the lightest of that which was in their
treasuries of gems and things of price and gathered together much
matter. Then they equipped them ten mules and hired them
servants of other than the people of the country; and Salim bade his
sister Salma don man’s dress. Now she was the likest of all creatures
to him, so that, when she was clad in man’s clothing, the folk
knew no difference between them:—extolled be the perfection of
Him who hath no like, there is no god but He! Then he told her
to mount a mare, whilst he himself took another, and they set
out under cover of the night; nor did any of their family or
household know of them. So they fared on into Allah’s wide
world and gave not over going night and day for a space of two
months, at the end of which they came to a city on the sea-shore
of the land of Makran,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5593" id="noteref-5593" epub:type="noteref">5593</a> by name Al-Sharr, and it is the
first city in Sind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5594" id="noteref-5594" epub:type="noteref">5594</a> They lighted down within sight of the
place and when they arose in the morning, they saw a populous
city and a goodly, seemly of semblance and great, abounding
in trees and rills and fruits and wide of suburbs which stretched to
the neighbouring villages. So the young man said to his sister
Salma, “Tarry thou here in thy place, till I enter the city and
make proof of it and its people and seek us out a stead which we
may buy and whereto we may remove. An it befit us, we will
make us a home therein, otherwise will we take counsel of departing
elsewhere.” Quoth she, “Do this, trusting in the bounty of Allah
(to whom belong honour and glory) and in His blessing.” Accordingly
he took a belt, wherein were a thousand gold pieces,
and girding it about his waist, entered the city and ceased not
going round about its streets and bazars and gazing upon its
houses and sitting with those of its citizens whose aspect showed
signs of worth and wealth, till the day was half spent, when he
resolved to return to his sister and said to himself, “Needs must I
buy what we may eat of ready-cooked food; I and my sister.”
Hereupon he addressed a man who sold roast meat and who was
clean of person, albe foul in his way of getting a living, and
said to him, “Take the price of this dishful and add thereto of
fowls and chickens and what not else is in your market of meats
and sweetmeats and bread and arrange it in the plates.” So the
Kitchener took the money and set apart for him what he desired,
then calling a porter, he laid it in the man’s crate, and Salim, after
paying the price of provisions and porterage in fullest fashion, was
about to go away, when the Cook said to him, “O youth, doubtless
thou art a stranger?” He replied, “Yes;” and the other rejoined,
“’Tis reported in one of the Traditions that the Apostle
said, Loyal admonition is a part of religion; and the wise and
ware have declared counsel is of the characteristics of True
Believers. And verily that which I have seen of thy ways pleaseth
me and I would fain give thee a warning.” Rejoined Salim,
“Speak out thy warning, and may Allah strengthen thy purpose!”
Then said the Cook, “Know, O my son, that in this our city,
when a stranger entereth and eateth of flesh-meat and drinketh
not old wine upon it, ’tis harmful to him and disturbeth his
body with disorders which be dangerous. Wherefore, an thou
have provided thee somewhat of wine it is well, but, if not, haste to
procure it, ere thou take the meat and carry it away.” Quoth
Salim, “Allah requite thee with weal—Canst thou shew me
where liquor is sold?” and quoth the Cook, “With me is all thou
seekest.” The youth asked, “Is there a way for me to see it?”
and the Cook sprang up and answered, “Pass on.” So he entered
and the man showed him somewhat of wine; but he said,
“I desire better than this;” whereupon he opened a door and
entering, said to Salim, “Come in, and follow me.” Accordingly
Salim followed him till he brought him to an underground chamber
and showed him somewhat of wine that suited him. So he
occupied him with looking at it and taking him unawares, sprang
upon him from behind and threw him to the ground and sat upon
his breast. Then he drew a knife and set it to his jugular; whereupon
there betided Salim that wherewith Allah made him forget
all that He had decreed to him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5595" id="noteref-5595" epub:type="noteref">5595</a> and he cried to the Cook, “Why
dost thou this thing, O good fellow? Be mindful of the Almighty
and fear Him. Seest thou not I am a stranger man? And
knowest thou not I have behind me a forlorn defenceless<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5596" id="noteref-5596" epub:type="noteref">5596</a> woman.
Wherefore wilt thou kill me?” Quoth the Kitchener, “Needs must I
kill thee, so I may take thy money;” and quoth Salim, “Take
my money, but kill me not, neither enter into sin against me; and
do with me kindness, for indeed the taking of my coin is more
venial than the taking of my life.” The Cook replied, “This is
nonsense. Thou canst not deliver thyself herewith, O youth,
because in thy deliverance is my destruction.” Cried Salim, “I
swear to thee and give thee the bond of Allah (to whom belong
honour and glory) and His covenant, which He took of His prophets
that I will not discover thy secret; no, never.” But the Kitchener
replied, “Away! Away! Alas! Alas! To this there is no path.”
However, Salim ceased not to conjure him and humble himself to
him and weep, while the Cook persisted in his intent to cut his
throat: then he shed tears and recited these couplets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5597" id="noteref-5597" epub:type="noteref">5597</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Haste not to that thou dost desire, for haste is still unblest; Be merciful to men, as thou on mercy reckonest:</div>
      <div class="line">For no hand is there but the hand of God is over it And no oppressor but shall be with worse than he opprest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Quoth the Kitchener, “There is no help save that I slay thee, O
fellow; for an I spare thee, I shall myself be slain.” But Salim
said, “O my brother, I will advise thee somewhat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5598" id="noteref-5598" epub:type="noteref">5598</a> other than
this.” Asked the Cook, “What is it? Say and be brief, ere I cut
thy throat;” and Salim answered, “Suffer me to live and keep me
as thy Mameluke, thy white slave, and I will work at a craft of
the skilled workmen, wherefrom there shall result to thee every
day two dinars.” Quoth the Kitchener, “What is the craft?”
and quoth Salim, “The cutting of gems and jewels.” When the
man heard this, he said to himself, “’Twill do me no hurt if I imprison
him and fetter him and bring him that whereat he may
work. An he tell truth, I will let him live, and if he prove a liar,
I will kill him.” So he took a pair of stout shackles and fitting
them on Salim’s legs, jailed him within his house and charged a
man to guard him. Then he asked him what tools he needed for
work; and Salim described to him whatso he required, and the
Cook went out from him awhile and brought him all he wanted.
Then Salim sat and wrought at his craft; and he used every day
to earn two dinars; and this was his wont and custom with the
Kitchener, who fed him not but half his fill. Thus befel it with
Salim; but returning to his sister Salma, she awaited him till the
last of the day, yet he appeared not; and she expected him a second
day and a third and a fourth, yet there came no news of him. So
she wept and beat hand on breast and bethought her of her affair
and her strangerhood and the disappearance of her brother; and
she improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Salam t’you! Would I could see you again, ✿ To the joy of my heart and the coolth of my eyes:</div>
      <div class="line">You are naught but my hope and the whole of my hope ✿ And under my ribs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5599" id="noteref-5599" epub:type="noteref">5599</a> love for you buried lies.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">She tarried on this wise awaiting him till the end of the month,
but no tidings of him came nor happened she upon aught of his
trace; wherefore she was troubled with exceeding trouble and
sending her servants hither and thither in search of him, abode in
the sorest that might be of chagrin and concern. When it was the
beginning of the new month, she arose in the morning and bidding
one of her men cry her brother throughout the city, sat to receive
visits of condolence, nor was there any in town but made act of
presence to condole with her; and they were all sorry for her,
doubting not her being a man. When three nights had passed
over her with their days of the second month, she despaired of him
and her tears never dried: then she resolved to take up her abode
in that city and making choice of a dwelling, removed thither.
The folk resorted to her from all parts, to sit with her and hear her
speech and witness her fine breeding; nor was it but a little while
ere the king died and the folk differed anent whom they should
invest with the kingship after him, so that civil war was like to
befal them. However, the men of judgment and the folk of understanding
and the people of experience directed them to crown the
youth who had lost his brother, for that they still held Salma to
be a man. They consented to this one and all; and, betaking
themselves to her, offered the kingship.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5600" id="noteref-5600" epub:type="noteref">5600</a> She refused, but they
were urgent with her, till she consented, saying within herself,
“My sole desire in the kingship is to find my brother.” Then
they seated her upon the throne of the realm and set the crown upon
her head, after which she undertook the business of governance
and ordinance of affairs; and they rejoiced in her with the utmost
joy. On such wise fared it with her; but as for Salim he abode
with the Cook a whole year’s space, bringing him two dinars a day;
and when his affair waxed longsome, the man felt for him and
pitied him. Presently he promised him release on condition that,
if he let him go, he should not discover his ill-deeds to the Sultan;
for that it was his wont now and then to entrap a man and carry
him to his house and slay him and take his money and cook his
flesh and give it to the folk to eat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5601" id="noteref-5601" epub:type="noteref">5601</a> So he asked him, “O youth,
wilt thou that I release thee from this thy misery, on condition
that thou be reasonable and never discover aught of thine affair?”
Salim answered, “I will swear to thee by whatsoever oath thou wilt
administer that I will keep thy secret and will not speak one
syllable anent thee, what while I am in the land of the living.”
Quoth the Kitchener, “I purpose to send thee forth with my
brother and cause thee voyage with him over the sea, on condition
that thou be to him a Mameluke, a boughten slave; and when he
cometh to the land of Hind, he shall sell thee and thus wilt thou
be delivered from prison and slaughter.” And quoth Salim, “’Tis
well: be it as thou sayst, may Allah the Most High requite thee
with weal!” Accordingly the Cook equipped his brother and
freighting him a craft, stowed therein a cargaison of merchandise.
Then he committed Salim to him and they set out with the ship.
The Lord decreed them safety, so that they arrived at the first city
of Hind, which is known as Al-Mansúrah,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5602" id="noteref-5602" epub:type="noteref">5602</a> and cast anchor there.
Now the king of that city had died, leaving a daughter and a
widow who, being the quickest-witted of women and cleverest of
the folk of her day, gave out that the girl was a boy, so that the
kingship might be established unto them. The troops and the
Emirs gave credit that the case was as she avouched and that the
Princess was a Prince; wherefore they obeyed her bidding and the
Queen-mother took order for the matter and used to dress the girl
in man’s habit and seat her on the throne of the kingship, so that
the Lords of the land and the chief officers of the realm used to go
in to her and salute her and do her service and depart, nothing
doubting but she was a boy. After this fashion they fared for
months and years and the Queen-mother ceased not to do thus till
the Cook’s brother came to the town in his ship, and with him
Salim. He landed with the youth and displayed him for sale
to the Queen who, when she saw him, prognosticated well of him;
presently she bought him and was kind to him and entreated him with
honour. Then began she to prove him in his moral parts and
make assay of him in his affairs, and she found in him all that is
in kings’ sons of understanding and fine breeding and good
manners and qualities. Thereupon she sent for him in private and
said to him, “I am minded to do thee a service, so thou canst keep
a secret.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5603" id="noteref-5603" epub:type="noteref">5603</a> He promised her all that she desired and she discovered
to him her mystery in the matter of her daughter, saying, “I will
marry thee to her and commit to thee the governance and constitute
thee king and ruler over this city.” He thanked her and
promised to carry out all she should order him, and she said to
him, “Go forth to such-an-one of the neighbouring provinces
privily.” So he went forth and on the morrow she made ready
loads and gear and gifts and bestowed on him abundant substance,
all of which they loaded on the backs of baggage-camels. Then
she gave out among the folk that the nephew of the king, the
son of his brother, was come and bade the Grandees and troops
go forth to meet him in a body: she also decorated the city in his
honour and the kettle-drums of good tidings beat for him whilst
all the king’s household went out and dismounting before him,
escorted him into, and lodged him with the queen-mother in the
palace. Then she bade the Headmen of the state attend his
assembly; so they obeyed and witnessed of his breeding and good
parts that which amazed them and made them forget the breeding
of the kings who had preceded him. When they were grown to
like him, the Queen-mother began sending privily for the Emirs
and Councillors, one by one, and swearing them to conceal her
project; and when she was assured of their discretion, she discovered
to them that the king had left naught save a daughter and
that she had done this only that she might continue the kingship
in his family and that the rule should not go forth from them;
after which she informed them that she was minded to marry her
daughter with her nephew, the new-comer; and that he should be
the holder of the kingship. They approved her proposal and
when she had discovered the secret to the last of them and assured
herself of their aid, she published the news abroad and threw off
all concealment. Then she sent for the Kazis and Assessors, who
drew up the contract of marriage between Salim and the Princess,
and they lavished gifts upon the soldiery and overwhelmed them
with largesse. The bride was incontinently carried in procession
to the young man and the kingship was established to him. They
tarried after this fashion a whole year when Salim said to the
Queen-mother, “Know that my life is not pleasing to me nor can
I abide with you in content till I get me tidings of my sister and
learn how her affair hath ended and how she hath fared after me.
So I will go forth and be absent from you a year’s space; then
will I return to you, Inshallah—an it please God the Most High—and
I win of this that which I hope.” Quoth she, “I will not
trust to thy word, but will go with thee and help thee to whatso
thou wishest and further thee myself therein.” Then she took a
ship and loaded it with all manner things of price, goods and
monies and the like. Furthermore, she appointed one of the
Wazirs, a man in whom she trusted for his conduct and contrivance,
to rule the realm, saying to him, “Abide in governance
a full year and ordain all thou needest.” Presently the Queen-mother
and her daughter and son-in-law Salim went down to the
ship and sailed on till they made the land of Makran. Their
arrival there befel at the last of the day; so they nighted in their
ship, and when the morn was near to dawn, the young king landed,
that he might go to the Hammam, and walked market-wards.
As he drew near the bath, the Cook met him on the way and
knew him; so he seized him and pinioning him straightly, carried
him to his house, where he clapped the old fetters on his feet and
cast him back into his former place of durance vile.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5604" id="noteref-5604" epub:type="noteref">5604</a> Salim, finding
himself in that sorry condition and considering that wherewith
he was afflicted of tribulation and the reverses of his fair fortune,
in that he had been a king and was now returned to fetters and
prison and hunger, wept and groaned and lamented and improvised
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My God, no patience now can aid afford; ✿ Strait is my breast, O Thou of Lords the Lord:</div>
      <div class="line">My God, who in resource like thine hath force? ✿ And Thou, the Subtle, dost my case record.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">On this wise fared it with Salim; but as regards his wife and her
mother, when she awoke in the morning and her husband returned
not to her with break of dawn, she forbode all manner of calamity
and, straightway arising, she despatched her servants and all who
were with her in quest of her spouse; but they happened not on
any trace of him nor could they hear aught of his news. So she
bethought herself concerning the case and plained and wept and
groaned and sighed and blamed Fortune the fickle, bewailing the
changes of Time and reciting these couplets<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5605" id="noteref-5605" epub:type="noteref">5605</a>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">God keep the days of love-delight! How passing sweet they were! How joyous and how solaceful was life in them whilere!</div>
      <div class="line">Would he were not, who sundered us upon the parting-day! How many a body hath he slain, how many a bone laid bare!</div>
      <div class="line">Sans fault of mine, my blood and tears he shed and beggared me Of him I love yet for himself gained nought thereby whate’er.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">When she had made an end of her verses, she considered her
affair and said within herself, “By Allah, all these things have betided
by the predestination of Almighty Allah and His decree and
this upon the forehead was written in lines.” Then she landed and
walked on till she came to a spacious place, and an open, where
she asked of the folk and hired a house. Thither she transported
forthright all that was in the ship of goods and sending after
brokers, sold all that was with her. Presently she took part of the
price and began enquiring of the folk, so haply she might scent out
tidings of the lost one; and she addressed herself to lavishing alms
and preparing medicines for the sick, clothing the naked and
watering the dry ground<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5606" id="noteref-5606" epub:type="noteref">5606</a> of the forlorn. She ceased not so doing
a whole year, and little by little she sold off her goods and gave
charitable gifts to the sick and sorry; whereby her report was
bruited abroad in the city and the folk abounded in her praise.
All this while Salim lay in fetters and strait prison, and melancholy
gat hold of him by reason of that whereinto he had fallen of this
affliction. At last, when care waxed on him and calamity grew
longsome, he fell sick of a sore sickness. Then the Kitchener, seeing
his plight (and verily he was like to sink for much suffering), loosed
him from the fetters and bringing him forth of the prison, committed
him to an old woman, who had a nose the bigness of a
gugglet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5607" id="noteref-5607" epub:type="noteref">5607</a> and bade her nurse him and medicine him and serve him
and entreat him kindly, so haply he might be made whole of that
his sickness. Accordingly the old woman took him and carrying
him to her lodging, began nursing him and giving him to eat and
drink; and when he was delivered of that torment, he recovered
from the malady which had afflicted him. Now the old woman
had heard from the folk of the lady who gave alms to the sick, and
indeed the news of her bounties reached both poor and rich; so
she arose and bringing out Salim to the door of her house, laid him
upon a mat and wrapped him in an Abá-gown and sat over against
him. Presently, it befel that the lady passed by them, and the old
woman seeing her rose to her and blessed her, saying, “O my
daughter, O thou to whom belong goodness and beneficence and
charity and almsdoing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5608" id="noteref-5608" epub:type="noteref">5608</a> know that this young man is a foreigner,
and indeed lack and lice and hunger and nakedness and cold slay
him.” When the lady heard this, she gave her alms and presented
her with a part of that which was with her; and indeed her
charitable heart inclined to Salim, but she knew him not for her
spouse. The old woman received the alms from her and carrying it
to Salim, took part for herself and with the rest bought him an old
shirt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5609" id="noteref-5609" epub:type="noteref">5609</a> in which she clad him, after she had stripped him of that he
had on. Then she threw away the frock she had taken from off
him and arising forthwith, washed his body of that which was
thereon of grime and scented him with somewhat of scent. She
also bought him chickens and made him broth; so he ate and his life
returned to him and he abode with her in all comfort of condition
till the morrow. Next morning the old woman said to Salim, “When
the lady cometh to thee, arise and buss her hand and say to her:—I
am a homeless man and indeed cold and hunger kill me; so
haply she may give thee somewhat that thou mayest expend upon
thy case.” And he answered, “To hear is to obey.” Then she
took him by the hand and carrying him without her house, seated
him at the door; and as he sat, behold, the lady came up to him,
whereupon the old woman rose to her and Salim kissed her hand
and, looking at her the while, blessed her. But when he saw her,
he knew her for his wife; so he shrieked and shed tears and
groaned and plained, at which she came up to him and threw herself
upon him; for indeed she knew him with all knowledge, even
as he knew her. So she hung to him and embraced him and
called to her serving men and attendants and those who were about
her; and they took him up and carried him forth of that stead.
When the old woman saw this, she cried out to the Cook within the
house, and he said to her, “Fare thou before me.” So she forewent
him and he ran after her and ceased not running till he overtook
the party and seizing Salim, exclaimed, “What aileth you to
take my slave-lad?” Whereupon the Queen cried out at him, saying,
“Know that this is my husband, whom I had lost;” and Salim
also cried out, saying, “Mercy! Mercy! I appeal to Allah and to the
Sultan against this Satan!” Therewith a world of folk straightway
gathered together and loud rose the cries and the clamours between
them; but the most part of them said, “Carry their case up to the
Sultan.” So they referred the matter to the king, who was none
other than Salim’s sister Salma. Then they repaired to the palace
and the dragoman went in to Salma and said to her, “O king of
the age, here is a Hindi woman, who cometh from the land of
Hind, and she hath laid hands on a servant, a young man, claiming
him as her husband, who hath been lost to her these two years,
and she journeyed not hither save for his sake, and in very sooth these
many days she hath done almsdeeds in thy city. And here is a fellow,
a Kitchener, who declareth that the young man is his slave.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5610" id="noteref-5610" epub:type="noteref">5610</a>
When the Queen heard these words, her vitals quivered and she
groaned from a grieving heart and called to mind her brother
and that which had betided him. Then she bade those around her
bring them between her hands, and when she saw them, she knew
her brother and was about to cry aloud; but her reason restrained
her; yet could she not prevent herself rising up and sitting down.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5611" id="noteref-5611" epub:type="noteref">5611</a>
At last, however, she enforced her soul to patience and said to them,
“Let each and every of you acquaint me with his case.” So Salim
came forward and kissing ground before the king, lauded him and
related to him his story from first to last, until the time of their
coming to that city, he and his sister, telling him how he had entered
the place and had fallen into the hands of the Cook and that which
had betided him and whatso he had suffered from him of beating and
collars, of fetters and pinioning, till the man had made him his
brother’s Mameluke, a boughten slave, and how the brother had sold
him in Hind and he had become king by marrying the Princess: and
how life was not lovesome to him till he should foregather with his
sister and now the same Cook had fallen in with him a second
time and had pinioned and fettered him. Brief, he acquainted her
with that which had betided him of sickness and sorrow for the
space of a whole year. When he had made an end of his speech,
his wife straightways came forward and told her story, from incept
to termination, how her mother bought him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5612" id="noteref-5612" epub:type="noteref">5612</a> from the Cook’s partner
and the people of the kingdom came under his rule; nor did she cease
telling till she came, in her history, to that city and acquainted the
king with the manner of her meeting her husband. When she had
made an end of her adventure, the Kitchener exclaimed, “Alack,
what befals us from lying rascals. By Allah, O king, this woman
lieth against me, for this youth is my rearling<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5613" id="noteref-5613" epub:type="noteref">5613</a> and he was born of
one of my slave-girls. He fled from me and I found him again.”
When the Queen heard the last of the talk, she said to the Cook,
“The decree between you shall not be save in accordance with
justice.” Then she dismissed all those who were present and
turning to her brother, said to him, “Indeed thy truth is stablished
with me and the sooth of thy speech, and praised be Allah who
hath brought about reunion between thee and thy wife! So now
begone with her to thy country and cease to seek thy sister Salma
and depart in peace.” But, hearing this, Salim replied, “By Allah,
by the might of the All-knowing King, I will not turn back from
seeking my sister till I die or I find her, Inshallah!” Then he
called his sister to mind and improvised from a heart disappointed,
troubled, afflicted, these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c003">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O thou who blam’st me for my heart, in anger twitting me, ✿ Hadst tasted what my heart did taste, thou wouldst be pitying me!</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, O my chider for my sister leave, ah! leave ✿ My heart to moan its grief and feel the woes befitting me.</div>
      <div class="line">Indeed I grew to hold her dear privily, publicly; ✿ And in my bosom bides a pang at no time quitting me;</div>
      <div class="line">And in my vitals burns a flame that ne’er was equalled by ✿ The fire of hell and blazeth high to Death committing me.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="c000">Now when his sister Salma heard what he said, she could no longer
restrain her soul, but threw herself upon him and discovered to him
her case. When he knew her, he threw himself upon her swooning
awhile; after which he came to himself and cried, “Lauded be
the Lord, the Bountiful, the Beneficent!” Then they plained each
to other of that they had suffered from the pangs of parting, whilst
Salim’s wife wondered at this and Salma’s patience and endurance
pleased her. So she saluted her with the Salam, and thanked her
for her fair boons, saying, “By Allah, O my lady, all that we are
in of gladness never befel us save by thy blessing; so praised be
Allah who deigned vouchsafe us thy sight!” Then they tarried
all three, Salma, Salim and his wife, in joy and happiness and
delight three days, veiled from the folk; and it was bruited abroad
in the city that the king had found his brother, who was lost for
many a year, and had saved him from the Cook’s house. On the
fourth day, all the troops and the lieges assembled together to see
the King and standing at his gate, craved leave to enter. Salma
bade admit them; so they entered and paid her royal suit and
service and gave her joy of her brother’s safe return. She bade
them do homage to Salim, and they consented and sware fealty to
him; after which they kept silence awhile, so they might hear
what the king should command. Then quoth Salma, “Ho, ye
gathering of soldiers and subjects, ye wot that ye forced me willy-nilly
to accept the kingship and besought me thereof and I consented
to your desires anent my being raised to rule over you; and
I did this against my will; for I would have you know that I am
a woman and that I disguised myself and donned man’s dress, so
peradventure my case might be concealed when I lost my brother.
But now Allah hath deigned reunite me with my brother, and it is
no longer lawful to me that I be king and Sultan over the people,
and I a woman; because there is no Sultanate for women, whenas
men are present.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5614" id="noteref-5614" epub:type="noteref">5614</a> For this reason, an it suit you, set my brother
on the throne of the kingdom, for this is he; and I will busy myself
with the worship of Allah the Most High and thanksgiving to
Him for my reunion with my brother. Or, an ye prefer it, take
your kingship and make whom ye will ruler and liege lord thereof.”
Upon this the folk all cried out, saying, “We accept him to king
over us;” and they did him suit and service and gave him joy of
the kingship. So the preachers preached the sermon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5615" id="noteref-5615" epub:type="noteref">5615</a> in his name
and the court-poets praised him; and he lavished largesse upon
the soldiery and the suite and overwhelmed them with favours and
bounties and was prodigal to the Ryots of justice and equity, with
goodly policy and polity. When he had effected this much of his
affect, he caused bring forth the Cook and his household to the divan,
but spared the old woman who had nursed him, because she had been
the cause of his deliverance. Then all assembled without the
town and he tormented the Cook and those who were with him with
all manner torments, after which he did him to die by the foulest
of deaths<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5616" id="noteref-5616" epub:type="noteref">5616</a> and burning him with fire, scattered his ashes far and
wide in the air. After this Salim abode in the governance, invested
with the Sultanate, and ruled the people a whole year, when he returned
to Al-Mansúrah and sojourned there another year. And he
and his wife ceased not to go from city to city and tarry in this a
year and that a year, till he was vouchsafed children and they grew
up, whereupon he appointed him of his sons, who was found fitting,
to be his deputy in one kingdom and he ruled in the other; and
he lived, he and his wife and children, what while Almighty Allah
willed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5617" id="noteref-5617" epub:type="noteref">5617</a> “Nor” (continued the Wazir), “O King of the age, is this
story rarer or stranger than the King of Hind and his wronged
and envied Minister.” When the King heard this, his mind was
occupied,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5618" id="noteref-5618" epub:type="noteref">5618</a> and he bade the Wazir hie to his own house.</p>

<p class="c000">When the evening evened, the King summoned the Minister and
bade him tell the story of the King of Hind and his Wazir. So he
said, “Hearkening and obedience. Give ear, O auspicious King,
to</p>

<h3 class="c012"><i>THE TALE OF THE KING OF HIND AND HIS WAZIR</i>.”</h3>

<p class="c013">There was once in the Hind-land a king illustrious of worth,
endowed with understanding and policy, and his name was Shah
Bakht. He had a Minister, a godly man and a sagacious, right
prudent in rede, conformable to him in governance and just in
judgment; for which cause his enviers were many and many were
the hypocrites who sought faults in him and set snares for him, so
that they insinuated into King Shah Bakht’s eyes hatred against
him and sowed in his heart despite towards him; and plot followed
plot, and their rancour waxed until the king was brought to arrest
him and lay him in jail and to confiscate his wealth and degrade
him from his degree. When they knew that there was left him no
possession for which the king might lust, they feared lest the
sovran release him, by the influence of the Wazir’s good counsel
upon the king’s heart, and he return to his former case, so should
their machinations be marred and their degrees degraded, for that
they knew that the king would need whatso he had known from
that man nor would forget aught wherewith he was familiar in him.
Now it came to pass that a certain person of perverted belief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5619" id="noteref-5619" epub:type="noteref">5619</a>
found a way to the adorning of falsehood with a semblance of fair-seeming
and there proceeded from him that whereby the hearts of
the folk were occupied, and their minds were corrupted by his
lying tales; for that he made use of Indian quiddities<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5620" id="noteref-5620" epub:type="noteref">5620</a> and forged
them into proof for the denial of the Maker, the Creator, extolled
be His might and exalted be He and glorified and magnified
above the speech of the deniers. He avouched that it is the
planets which order all worldly affairs and he set down twelve
mansions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5621" id="noteref-5621" epub:type="noteref">5621</a> to twelve Zodiacal signs and made each sign thirty
degrees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5622" id="noteref-5622" epub:type="noteref">5622</a> after the number of the days of the month, so that in
twelve mansions there are three hundred and sixty, after the
number of the days of the year; and he wrought a work, wherein
he lied and was an infidel and denied the Deity, be He for ever
blessed! Then he laid hold of the king’s heart and the enviers
and haters aided him against the Minister and won the royal
favour and corrupted his intent against the Wazir, so that he got
of him that which he got and at last his lord banished him
and thrust him away. By such means the wicked man obtained
that which he sought of the Minister and the case was prolonged
till the affairs of the kingdom became disordered, by dint of ill
government, and the most part of the king’s reign fell off from him
and he came nigh unto ruin. On this wise he was assured of the
loyalty of his whilome sagacious Wazir and the excellence of his
ordinance and the rectitude of his rede. So he sent after him and
brought him and the wicked man before him and summoning to
his presence the Lords of his land and the Chiefs of his chieftainship,
gave them leave to talk and dispute and forbade the wicked
man from his perverted belief.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5623" id="noteref-5623" epub:type="noteref">5623</a> Then arose that wise Minister and
skilful and praised Allah Almighty and lauded Him and glorified
Him and hallowed Him and attested His unity and disputed with
the miscreant and overcame him and silenced him; nor did he
cease from him till he compelled him to make confession of repentance
from that which he had misbelieved. Therewith King Shah
Bakht rejoiced with exceeding great joy and cried, “Praise be to
the Lord who hath saved me from this man and hath preserved
me from the loss of my kingship and my prosperity!” So the
affair of the Wazir returned to order and stablishment and the
king restored him to his place and raised him to higher rank.
Lastly, he assembled the folk who had striven against him and
destroyed them all, to the last man. “And how like” (continued
the Wazir), “is this story to that of myself and King Shah Bakht,
with regard to that which befel me of the changing of the King
and his crediting others against me; but now is the fairness of my
fashion fulfilled in thine eyes, for that Allah Almighty hath
inspired thee with wisdom and endowed thee with longanimity
and patience to hear from me whatso He allotted to those who
forewent us, till He hath shown forth my innocence and made
manifest unto thee the truth. For lo and behold! the days are
now past, wherein it was declared to the king that I should labour
for the loss of my soul,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5624" id="noteref-5624" epub:type="noteref">5624</a> that is within the month; and lookye, the
probation-time is gone by, and past is the season of evil and it
hath ceased by the protection of the King and his good fortune.”
Then he bowed his head and was silent. When King Shah Bakht
heard his Wazir’s speech, he was abashed before him and confounded,
and he marvelled at the gravity of his intellect and his
long-suffering. So he sprang up to him and embraced him and
the Minister kissed his feet. Then the King called for a costly
robe of honour and cast it over Al-Rahwan and honoured him
with the highmost honour and showed him especial favour and
restored him to his degree and Wazirate. Furthermore he imprisoned
those who had devised his destruction with lies and
leasing and gave him full leave and license to pass judgment upon
the Interpreter who had expounded to him the dream. So the
Wazir abode in the ordering of the realm until Death came to
them; “And this” (added Shahrazad) “is all, O king of the age,
that hath come down to us of King Shah Bakht and his Wazir.”</p>
