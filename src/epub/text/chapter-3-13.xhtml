			<h2 epub:type="title">Tale of Kamar Al-Zaman</h2>

<p>That there was in times of yore and in ages long gone before
a King called Shahrimán,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1453" id="noteref-1453" epub:type="noteref">1453</a> who was lord of many troops and
guards, and officers, and who reigned over certain islands,
known as the Khálidán Islands,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1454" id="noteref-1454" epub:type="noteref">1454</a> on the borders of the land of
the Persians. But he was stricken in years and his bones were
wasted, without having been blessed with a son, albeit he had
four wives, daughters of Kings, and threescore concubines, with
each of whom he was wont to lie one night in turn.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1455" id="noteref-1455" epub:type="noteref">1455</a> This
preyed upon his mind and disquieted him, so that he complained
thereof to one of his Wazirs, saying, "Verily I fear lest
my kingdom be lost when I die, for that I have no son to
succeed me." The Minister answered, "O King, peradventure
Allah shall yet bring something to pass; so rely upon the Almighty
and be instant in prayer. It is also my counsel that
thou spread a banquet and invite to it the poor and needy, and
let them eat of thy food; and supplicate the Lord to vouchsafe
thee a son; for perchance there may be among thy guests a
righteous soul whose prayers find acceptance; and thereby thou
shalt win thy wish." So the King rose, made the lesser ablution,
and prayed a two-bow prayer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1456" id="noteref-1456" epub:type="noteref">1456</a> then he cried upon Allah
with pure intention; after which he called his chief wife to bed
and lay with her forthright. By grace of God she conceived
and, when her months were accomplished, she bore a male
child, like the moon on the night of fulness. The King named
him Kamar al-Zamán,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1457" id="noteref-1457" epub:type="noteref">1457</a> and rejoiced in him with extreme joy
and bade the city be dressed out in his honour; so they decorated
the streets seven days, whilst the drums beat and the
messengers bore the glad tidings abroad. Then wet and dry
nurses were provided for the boy and he was reared in splendour
and delight, until he reached the age of fifteen. He grew up
of surpassing beauty and seemlihead and symmetry, and his
father loved him so dear that he could not brook to be parted
from him day or night. One day he complained to a certain
of his Ministers anent the excess of his love for his only child,
saying, "O thou the Wazir, of a truth I fear for my son, Kamar
al-Zaman, the shifts and accidents which befal man and fain
would I marry him in my lifetime." Answered the Wazir, "O
King, know thou that marriage is one of the most honourable
of moral actions, and thou wouldst indeed do well and right to
marry thy son in thy lifetime, ere thou make him Sultan." On
this quoth the King, "Hither with my son Kamar al-Zaman;"
so he came and bowed his head to the ground in modesty
before his sire. "O Kamar al-Zaman," said King Shahriman, "of
a truth I desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee during my
lifetime." Replied he, "O my father, know that I have no lust
to marry nor doth my soul incline to women; for that concerning
their craft and perfidy I have read many books and heard
much talk, even as saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Now, an of women ask ye, I reply:— ✿ In their affairs I'm versed a doctor rare!</div>
      <div class="line">When man's head grizzles and his money dwindles, ✿ In their affections he hath naught for share."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And another said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Rebel against women and so shalt thou serve Allah the more; ✿ The youth who gives women the rein must forfeit all hope to soar.</div>
      <div class="line">They'll baulk him when seeking the strange device, Excelsior, ✿ Tho' waste he a thousand of years in the study of science and lore.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he had ended his verses he continued, "O my father,
wedlock is a thing whereto I will never consent; no, not though
I drink the cup of death." When Sultan Shahriman heard these
words from his son, light became darkness in his sight and he
grieved thereat with great grief.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King
Shahriman heard these words from his son, the light became darkness
in his sight and he grieved over his son's lack of obedience
to his directions in the matter of marriage; yet, for the great love
he bore him, he was unwilling to repeat his wishes and was
not wroth with him, but caressed him and spake him fair and
showed him all manner of kindness such as tendeth to induce
affection. All this, and Kamar al-Zaman Increased daily in beauty
and loveliness and amorous grace; and the King bore with him
for a whole year till he became perfect in eloquence and elegant
wit. All men were ravished with his charms; and every breeze
that blew bore the tidings of his gracious favour; his fair sight
was a seduction to the loving and a garden of delight to the
longing, for he was honey-sweet of speech and the sheen of his
face shamed the full moon; he was a model of symmetry and
blandishment and engaging ways; his shape was as the willow-wand
or the rattan-cane and his cheeks might take the place
of rose or red anemone. He was, in fine the pink of perfection,
even as the poet hath said of him:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He came and cried they, "Now be Allah blest! ✿ Praise Him that clad that soul in so fair vest!"</div>
      <div class="line">He's King of Beauty where the beauteous be; ✿ All are his Ryots,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1458" id="noteref-1458" epub:type="noteref">1458</a> all obey his hest:</div>
      <div class="line">His lip-dew's sweeter than the virgin honey; ✿ His teeth are pearls in double row close prest:</div>
      <div class="line">All charms are congregate in him alone, ✿ And deals his loveliness to man unrest.</div>
      <div class="line">Beauty wrote on those cheeks for worlds to see ✿ "I testify there is none good but He."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1459" id="noteref-1459" epub:type="noteref">1459</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the year came to an end, the King called his son to him
and said, "O my son, wilt thou not hearken to me?" Whereupon
Kamar al-Zaman fell down for respect and shame before his
sire and replied, "O my father, how should I not hearken to thee,
seeing that Allah commandeth me to obey thee and not gainsay
thee?" Rejoined King Shahriman, "O my son, know that I
desire to marry thee and rejoice in thee whilst yet I live, and
make thee King over my realm, before my death." When the
Prince heard his sire pronounce these words he bowed his head
awhile, then raised it and said, "O my father, this is a thing which
I will never do; no, not though I drink the cup of death! I
know of a surety that the Almighty hath made obedience to thee
a duty in religion; but, Allah upon thee! press me not in this
matter of marriage, nor fancy that I will ever marry my life
long; for that I have read the books both of the ancients and the
moderns, and have come to know all the mischiefs and miseries
which have befallen them through women and their endless
artifices. And how excellent is the saying of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">He whom the randy motts entrap ✿ Shall never see deliverance!</div>
      <div class="line">Though build he forts a thousand-fold, ✿ Whose mighty strength lead-plates enhance,<a id="fn227"></a><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1460" id="noteref-1460" epub:type="noteref">1460</a></div>
      <div class="line">Their force shall be of no avail; ✿ These fortresses have not a chance!</div>
      <div class="line">Women aye deal in treachery ✿ To far and near o'er earth's expanse;</div>
      <div class="line">With fingers dipt in Henna-blood ✿ And locks in braids that mad the glance;</div>
      <div class="line">And eyelids painted o'er with Kohl ✿ They gar us drink of dire mischance.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And how excellently saith another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Women, for all the chastity they claim, ✿ Are offal cast by kites where'er they list:</div>
      <div class="line">This night their talk and secret charms are thine; ✿ That night another joyeth calf and wrist:</div>
      <div class="line">Like inn, whence after night thou far'st at dawn, ✿ And lodges other wight thou hast not wist."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1461" id="noteref-1461" epub:type="noteref">1461</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when King Shahriman heard these his son's words and learnt
the import of his verses and poetical quotations, he made no
answer, of his excessive love for him, but redoubled in graciousness
and kindness to him. He at once broke up the audience
and, as soon as the seance was over, he summoned his Minister
and taking him apart, said to him, "O thou the Wazir! tell me
how I shall deal with my son in the matter of marriage."——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King
summoned his Minister; and, taking him apart, said to him,
"O thou the Wazir, tell me what I shall do with my son in the
matter of marriage. Of a truth I took counsel with thee thereon
and thou didst counsel me to marry him, before making him
King. I have spoken with him of wedlock time after time and
he still gainsaid me; so do thou, O Wazir, forthright advise me
what to do." Answered the Minister, "O King, wait another year
and, if after that thou be minded to speak to him on the matter
of marriage, speak not to him privily, but address him on a day of
state, when all the Emirs and Wazirs are present with the whole of
the army standing before thee. And when all are in crowd then
send for thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and summon him; and, when
he cometh, broach to him the matter of marriage before the Wazirs
and Grandees and Officers of state and Captains; for he will
surely be bashful and daunted by their presence and will not dare
to oppose thy will." Now when King Shahriman heard his Wazir's
words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, seeing success in the project,
and bestowed on him a splendid robe of honour. Then he
took patience with his son another year, whilst, with every day
that passed over him, Kamar al-Zaman increased in beauty and
loveliness, and elegance and perfect grace, till he was nigh twenty
years old. Indeed Allah had clad him in the cloak of comeliness
and had crowned him with the crown of completion: his eye-glance
was more bewitching than Hárút and Marút<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1462" id="noteref-1462" epub:type="noteref">1462</a> and the play
of his luring looks more misleading than Tághút;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1463" id="noteref-1463" epub:type="noteref">1463</a> and his cheeks
shone like the dawn rosy-red and his eyelashes stormed the keen-edged
blade: the whiteness of his brow resembled the moon
shining bright, and the blackness of his locks was as the murky
night; and his waist was more slender than the gossamer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1464" id="noteref-1464" epub:type="noteref">1464</a> and
his back parts than two sand-heaps bulkier, making a Babel of
the heart with their softness; but his waist complained of the
weight of his hips and loins; and his charms ravished all mankind,
even as one of the poets saith in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"By his eyelash tendril curled, by his slender waist I swear,</div>
      <div class="line">By the dart his witchery feathers, fatal hurtling through the air;</div>
      <div class="line">By the just roundness of his shape, by his glances bright and keen,</div>
      <div class="line">By the swart limning of his locks, and his fair forehead shining sheen;</div>
      <div class="line">By his eyebrows which deny that she who looks on them should sleep,</div>
      <div class="line">Which now commanding, now forbidding, o'er me high dominion keep;</div>
      <div class="line">By the roses of his cheek, his face as fresh as myrtle wreath,</div>
      <div class="line">His tulip lips, and those pure pearls that hold the places of his teeth;</div>
      <div class="line">By his noble form, which rises featly turned in even swell</div>
      <div class="line">To where upon his jutting chest two young pomegranates seem to dwell;</div>
      <div class="line">By his supple moving hips, his taper waist, and silky skin,</div>
      <div class="line">By all he robbed Perfection of, and holds enchained his form within;</div>
      <div class="line">By his tongue of steadfastness, his nature true, and excellent,</div>
      <div class="line">By the greatness of his rank, his noble birth, and high descent,</div>
      <div class="line">Musk from my love her savour steals, who musk exhales from every limb</div>
      <div class="line">And all the airs ambergris breathes are but the Zephyr's blow o'er him.</div>
      <div class="line">The sun, methinks, the broad bright sun, as low before my love should quail</div>
      <div class="line">As would my love himself transcend the paltry paring of his nail!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1465" id="noteref-1465" epub:type="noteref">1465</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So King Shahriman, having accepted the counsel of his Wazir,
waited for another year and a great festival,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Shahriman
having accepted the counsel of his Wazir, waited for another year
and a great festival, a day of state when the audience hall was
filled with his Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of his reign and
Officers of State and Captains of might and main. Thereupon he
sent for his son Kamar al-Zaman who came, and kissing the
ground before him three times, stood in presence of his sire with
his hands behind his back the right grasping the left.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1466" id="noteref-1466" epub:type="noteref">1466</a> Then said
the King to him, "Know O my son, that I have not sent for thee on
this occasion and summoned thee to appear before this assembly
and all these officers of estate here awaiting our orders save and
except that I may lay a commandment on thee, wherein do thou
not disobey me; and my commandment is that thou marry, for I
am minded to wed thee to a King's daughter and rejoice in thee
ere I die." When the Prince heard this much from his royal sire,
he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then raising it towards his
father and being moved thereto at that time by youthful folly
and boyish ignorance, replied, "But for myself I will never marry;
no, not though I drink the cup of death! As for thee, thou art
great in age and small of wit: hast thou not, twice ere this day
and before this occasion, questioned me of the matter of marriage,
and I refused my consent? Indeed thou dotest and are not fit to
govern a flock of sheep!" So saying Kamar al-Zaman unclasped
his hands from behind his back and tucked up his sleeves above
his elbows before his father, being in a fit of fury; moreover, he
added many words to his sire, knowing not what he said in the
trouble of his spirits. The King was confounded and ashamed, for
that this befel in the presence of his grandees and soldier-officers
assembled on a high festival and a state occasion; but presently
the majesty of Kingship took him, and he cried out at his son
and made him tremble. Then he called to the guards standing
before him and said, "Seize him!" So they came forward and
laid hands on him and, binding him, brought him before his sire,
who bade them pinion his elbows behind his back and in this guise
make him stand before the presence. And the Prince bowed down
his head for fear and apprehension, and his brow and face were
beaded and spangled with sweat; and shame and confusion
troubled him sorely. Thereupon his father abused him and reviled
him and cried, "Woe to thee, thou son of adultery and nursling
of abomination!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1467" id="noteref-1467" epub:type="noteref">1467</a> How durst thou answer me on this wise before
my captains and soldiers? But hitherto none hath chastised
thee."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King
Shahriman cried out to his son Kamar al-Zaman, "How durst
thou answer me on this wise before my captains and soldiers? But
hitherto none hath chastised thee. Knowest thou not that this
deed thou hast done were a disgrace to him had it been done by
the meanest of my subjects?" And the King commanded his
Mamelukes to loose his elbow bonds and imprison him in one of
the bastions of the citadel. So they took the Prince and thrust
him into an old tower, wherein there was a dilapidated saloon and
in its middle a ruined well, after having first swept it and cleansed
its floor-flags and set therein a couch on which they laid a mattress,
a leathern rug and a cushion; and then they brought a great
lanthorn and a wax candle, for that place was dark, even by day.
And lastly the Mamelukes led Kamar al-Zaman thither, and
stationed an eunuch at the door. And when all this was done, the
Prince threw himself on the couch, sad-spirited, and heavy-hearted;
blaming himself and repenting of his injurious conduct to his
father, whenas repentance availed him naught, and saying, "Allah
curse marriage and marriageables and married women, the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traitresses</span> all! Would I had hearkened to my father and accepted
a wife! Had I so done it had been better for me than this
jail." This is how it fared with him; but as regards King Shahriman,
he remained seated on his throne all through the day until
sundown; then he took the Minister apart and said to him,
"Know thou, O Wazir, that thou and thou only wast the cause of
all this that hath come to pass between me and my son by the
advice thou wast pleased to devise; and so what dost thou counsel
me to do now?" Answered he, "O King, leave thy son in limbo
for the space of fifteen days: then summon him to thy presence
and bid him wed; and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again."——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir
said to King Shahriman, "Leave thy son in limbo for the space of
fifteen days; then summon him to thy presence and bid him wed;
and assuredly he shall not gainsay thee again." The King accepted
the Wazir's opinion and lay down to sleep that night
troubled at heart concerning his son; for he loved him with dearest
love because he had no other child but this; and it was his wont
every night not to sleep, save after placing his arm under his son's
neck. So he passed that night in trouble and unease on the
Prince's account, tossing from side to side, as he were laid on coals
of Artemisia-wood<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1468" id="noteref-1468" epub:type="noteref">1468</a>; for he was overcome with doubts and fears
and sleep visited him not all that livelong night; but his eyes ran
over with tears and he began repeating:</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">While slanderers slumber, longsome is my night; ✿ Suffice thee a heart so sad in parting-plight;</div>
      <div class="line">I say, while night in care slow moments by, ✿ "What! no return for thee, fair morning light?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And the saying of another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When saw I Pleiad-stars his glance escape ✿ And Pole-star draught of sleep upon him pour;</div>
      <div class="line">And the Bier-daughters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1469" id="noteref-1469" epub:type="noteref">1469</a> wend in mourning dight, ✿ I knew that morning was for him no more!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Kamar
al-Zaman, when the night came upon him the eunuch set the
lanthorn before him and lighting the wax-candle, placed it in the
candlestick; then brought him somewhat of food. The Prince ate
a little and continually reproached himself for his unseemly treatment
of his father, saying to himself, "O my soul, knowest thou
not that a son of Adam is the hostage of his tongue, and that a
man's tongue is what casteth him into deadly perils?" Then his
eyes ran over with tears and he bewailed that which he had done,
from anguished vitals and aching heart, repenting him with exceeding
repentance of the wrong wherewith he had wronged his
father and repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Fair youth shall die by stumbling of the tongue: ✿ Stumble of foot works not man's life such wrong:</div>
      <div class="line">The slip of lip shall oft smite off the head, ✿ While slip of foot shall never harm one long.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when he had made an end of eating, he asked for the wherewithal
to wash his hands and when the Mameluke had washed
them clean of the remnants of food, he arose and made the Wuzu-ablution
and prayed the prayers of sundown and nightfall, conjoining
them in one; after which he sat down.——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Prince Kamar al-Zaman had prayed (conjoining them in one) the
prayers of sundown and nightfall, he sat down on the well and
began reciting the Koran, and he repeated "The Cow," the "House
of Imrán," and "Y. S.;" The "Compassionate," "Blessed be the
King," "Unity" and "The two Talismans"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1470" id="noteref-1470" epub:type="noteref">1470</a>; and he ended with
blessing and supplication and with saying, "I seek refuge with
Allah from Satan the stoned."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1471" id="noteref-1471" epub:type="noteref">1471</a> Then he lay down upon his
couch which was covered with a mattress of satin from al-Ma'adin
town, the same on both sides and stuffed with the raw silk of
Irak; and under his head was a pillow filled with ostrich-down.
And when ready for sleep, he doffed his outer clothes and drew off
his bag-trousers and lay down in a shirt of delicate stuff smooth
as wax; and he donned a head-kerchief of azure Marázi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1472" id="noteref-1472" epub:type="noteref">1472</a> cloth;
and at such time and on this guise Kamar al-Zaman was like the
full-orbed moon, when it riseth on its fourteenth night. Then,
drawing over his head a coverlet of silk, he fell asleep with the
lanthorn burning at his feet and the wax-candle over his head, and
he ceased not sleeping through the first third of the night, not
knowing what lurked for him in the womb of the Future, and
what the Omniscient had decreed for him. Now, as Fate and
Fortune would have it, both tower and saloon were old and had
been many years deserted; and there was therein a Roman well
inhabited by a Jinníyah of the seed of Iblis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1473" id="noteref-1473" epub:type="noteref">1473</a> the Accursed, by
name Maymúnah, daughter of Al-Dimiryát, a renowned King of
the Jánn.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the name
of the Jinniyah in question was Maymunah, daughter of Al-Dimiryat;
a renowned King of the Jann. And as Kamar
al-Zaman continued sleeping till the first third of the night,
Maymunah came up out of the Roman well and made for the
firmament, thinking to listen by stealth to the converse of the
angels; but when she reached the mouth of the well, she saw a
light shining in the tower, contrary to custom; and having dwelt
there many years without seeing the like, she said to herself
"Never have I witnessed aught like this"; and, marvelling much
at the matter, determined that there must be some cause therefor.
So she made for the light and found the eunuch sleeping within
the door; and inside she saw a couch spread, whereon was a
human form with the wax-candle burning at his head and the
lanthorn at his feet, and she wondered to see the light and stole
towards it little by little. Then she folded her wings and stood
by the bed and, drawing back the coverlid, discovered Kamar
al-Zaman's face. She was motionless for a full hour in admiration
and wonderment; for the lustre of his visage outshone that of the
candle; his face beamed like a pearl with light; his eyelids were
languorous like those of the gazelle; the pupils of his eyes were
intensely black and brilliant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1474" id="noteref-1474" epub:type="noteref">1474</a>; his cheeks were rosy red; his eyebrows
were arched like bows and his breath exhaled a scent of
musk, even as saith of him the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I kissed him: darker grew those pupils,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1475" id="noteref-1475" epub:type="noteref">1475</a> which ✿ Seduce my soul, and cheeks flushed rosier hue;</div>
      <div class="line">O heart, if slanderers dare to deem there be ✿ His like in charms; Say "Bring him hither, you!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Maymunah saw him, she pronounced the formula of
praise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1476" id="noteref-1476" epub:type="noteref">1476</a> and said, "Blessed be Allah, the best of Creators!"; for
she was of the true-believing Jinn; and she stood awhile gazing
on his face, exclaiming and envying the youth his beauty and
loveliness. And she said in herself, "By Allah! I will do no hurt
to him nor let any harm him; nay, from all of evil will I ransom
him, for this fair face deserveth not but that folk should gaze upon
it and for it praise the Lord. Yet how could his family find it in
their hearts to leave him in such desert place where, if one of our
Márids came upon him at this hour, he would assuredly slay him."
Then the Ifritah Maymunah bent over him and kissed him between
the eyes, and presently drew back the sheet over his face which
she covered up; and after this she spread her wings and soaring
into the air, flew upwards. And after rising high from the circle
of the saloon she ceased not winging her way through air and
ascending skywards till she drew near the heaven of this world,
the lowest of the heavens. And behold, she heard the noisy flapping
of wings cleaving the welkin and, directing herself by the
sound, she found when she drew near it that the noise came from
an Ifrit called Dahnash. So she swooped down on him like a
sparrow-hawk and, when he was aware of her and knew her to be
Maymunah, the daughter of the King of the Jinn, he feared her
and his side-muscles quivered; and he implored her forbearance,
saying, "I conjure thee by the Most Great and August Name and
by the most noble talisman graven upon the seal-ring of Solomon,
entreat me kindly and harm me not!" When she heard these
words her heart inclined to him and she said, "Verily, thou conjurest
me, O accursed, with a mighty conjuration. Nevertheless,
I will not let thee go, till thou tell me whence thou comest at this
hour." He replied, "O Princess, Know that I come from the
uttermost end of China-land and from among the Islands, and I
will tell thee of a wonderful thing I have seen this night. If thou
find my words true, let me wend my way and write me a patent
under thy hand and with thy sign manual that I am thy freedman,
so none of the Jinn-hosts, whether of the upper who fly or of the
lower who walk the earth or of those who dive beneath the waters,
do me let or hindrance." Rejoined Maymunah, "And what is it
thou hast seen this night, O liar, O accursed! Tell me without
leasing and think not to escape from my hand with falses, for I
swear to thee by the letters graven upon the bezel of the seal-ring
of Solomon David-son (on both of whom be peace!), except thy
speech be true, I will pluck out thy feathers with mine own hand
and strip off thy skin and break thy bones!" Quoth the Ifrit
Dahnash son of Shamhúrish<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1477" id="noteref-1477" epub:type="noteref">1477</a> the Flyer, "I accept, O my lady,
these conditions."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash
spoke thus to Maymunah, "I accept, O my lady, these conditions."
Then he resumed, "Know, O my mistress, that I come to-night
from the Islands of the Inland Sea in the parts of China, which
are the realms of King Ghayúr, lord of the Islands and the Seas
and the Seven Palaces. There I saw a daughter of his, than whom
Allah hath made none fairer in her time: I cannot picture her
to thee, for my tongue would fail to describe her with her due of
praise; but I will name to thee a somewhat of her charms by way
of approach. Now her hair is like the nights of disunion and
separation and her face like the days of union and delectation;
and right well hath the poet said when picturing her:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She dispread the locks from her head one night, ✿ Showing four-fold nights into one night run;</div>
      <div class="line">And she turned her visage towards the moon, ✿ And two moons showèd at moment one.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She hath a nose like the edge of the burnished blade and cheeks
like purple wine or anemones blood-red: her lips as coral and
cornelian shine and the water of her mouth is sweeter than old
wine; its taste would quench Hell's fiery pain. Her tongue is
moved by wit of high degree and ready repartee: her breast is a
seduction to all that see it (glory be to Him who fashioned it and
finished it!); and joined thereto are two upper arms smooth and
rounded; even as saith of her the poet Al-Walahán:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1478" id="noteref-1478" epub:type="noteref">1478</a>—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She hath wrists which, did her bangles not contain, ✿ Would run from out her sleeves in silvern rain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>She hath breasts like two globes of ivory, from whose brightness
the moons borrow light, and a stomach with little waves as it were
a figured cloth of the finest Egyptian linen made by the Copts,
with creases like folded scrolls, ending in a waist slender past all
power of imagination; based upon back parts like a hillock of
blown sand, that force her to sit when she would lief stand, and
awaken her, when she fain would sleep, even as saith of her and
describeth her the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">She hath those hips conjoined by thread of waist, ✿ Hips that o'er me and her too tyrannise;</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And those back parts are upborne by thighs smooth and round
and by a calf like a column of pearl, and all this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">reposeth</span> upon
two feet, narrow, slender and pointed like spear-blades,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1480" id="noteref-1480" epub:type="noteref">1480</a> the handiwork
of the Protector and Requiter, I wonder how, of their littleness,
they can sustain what is above them. But I cut short
my praises of her charms fearing lest I be tedious."——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit
Dahnash bin Shamhurish said to the Ifritah Maymunah, "Of a
truth I cut short my praises fearing lest I be tedious." Now when
Maymunah heard the description of that Princess and her beauty
and loveliness, she stood silent in astonishment; whereupon Dahnash
resumed, "The father of this fair maiden is a mighty King, a fierce
knight, immersed night and day in fray and fight; for whom death
hath no fright and the escape of his foe no dread, for that he is a
tyrant masterful and a conqueror irresistible, lord of troops and
armies and continents and islands, and cities and villages, and his
name is King Ghayur, Lord of the Islands and of the Seas and of
the Seven Palaces. Now he loveth his daughter, the young maiden
whom I have described to thee, with dearest love and, for affection
of her, he hath heaped together the treasures of all the kings and
built her therewith seven palaces, each of a different fashion; the
first of crystal, the second of marble, the third of China steel, the
fourth of precious stones and gems of price, the fifth of porcelain
and many-hued onyxes and ring-bezels, the sixth of silver and
the seventh of gold. And he hath filled the seven palaces with
all sorts of sumptuous furniture, rich silken carpets and hangings
and vessels of gold and silver and all manner of gear that kings
require; and hath bidden his daughter to abide in each by turns
for a certain season of the year; and her name is the Princess
Budur.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1481" id="noteref-1481" epub:type="noteref">1481</a> Now when her beauty became known and her name and
fame were bruited abroad in the neighbouring countries, all the
kings sent to her father to demand her of him in marriage, and he
consulted her on the matter, but she disliked the very word wedlock
with a manner of abhorrence and said, O my father, I have no
mind to marry; no, not at all; for I am a sovereign Lady and a
Queen suzerain ruling over men, and I have no desire for a man
who shall rule over me. And the more suits she refused, the more
her suitors' eagerness increased and all the Royalties of the Inner
Islands of China sent presents and rarities to her father with letters
asking her in marriage. So he pressed her again and again with
advice on the matter of espousals; but she ever opposed to him
refusals, till at last she turned upon him angrily and cried, O my
father, if thou name matrimony to me once more, I will go into
my chamber and take a sword and, fixing its hilt in the ground,
will set its point to my waist; then will I press upon it, till it
come forth from my back, and so slay myself. Now when the
King heard these her words, the light became darkness in his sight
and his heart burned for her as with a flame of fire, because he
feared lest she should kill herself; and he was filled with perplexity
concerning her affair and the kings her suitors. So he said to her,
If thou be determined not to marry and there be no help for it:
abstain from going and coming in and out. Then he placed her
in a house and shut her up in a chamber, appointing ten old women
as duennas to guard her, and forbade her to go forth to the Seven
Palaces; moreover, he made it appear that he was incensed against
her, and sent letters to all the kings, giving them to know that she
had been stricken with madness by the Jinns; and it is now a year
since she hath thus been secluded." Then continued the Ifrit
Dahnash, addressing the Ifritah Maymunah, "And I, O my lady,
go to her every night and take my fill of feeding my sight on her
face and I kiss her between the eyes: yet, of my love to her, I do
her no hurt neither mount her, for that her youth is fair and her
grace surpassing: every one who seeth her jealouseth himself for
her. I conjure thee, therefore, O my lady, to go back with me and
look on her beauty and loveliness and stature and perfection of
proportion; and after, if thou wilt, chastise me or enslave me;
and win to thy will, for it is thine to bid and to forbid." So saying,
the Ifrit Dahnash bowed his head towards the earth and drooped
his wings downwards; but Maymunah laughed at his words and
spat in his face and answered, "What is this girl of whom thou
pratest but a potsherd wherewith to wipe after making water?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1482" id="noteref-1482" epub:type="noteref">1482</a>
Faugh! Faugh! By Allah, O accursed, I thought thou hadst
some wondrous tale to tell me or some marvellous news to give me.
How would it be if thou were to sight my beloved? Verily, this
night I have seen a young man, whom if thou saw though but in a
dream, thou wouldst be palsied with admiration and spittle would
flow from thy mouth." Asked the Ifrit, "And who and what is
this youth?"; and she answered, "Know, O Dahnash, that there
hath befallen the young man the like of what thou tellest me befel
thy mistress; for his father pressed him again and again to marry,
but he refused, till at length his sire waxed wroth at being opposed
and imprisoned him in the tower where I dwell: and I came up
to-night and saw him." Said Dahnash, "O my lady, shew me
this youth, that I may see if he be indeed handsomer than my
mistress, the Princess Budur, or not; for I cannot believe that the
like of her liveth in this our age." Rejoined Maymunah, "Thou
liest, O accursed, O most ill-omened of Marids and vilest of
Satans!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1483" id="noteref-1483" epub:type="noteref">1483</a> Sure am I that the like of my beloved is not in this
world."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eightieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifritah
Maymunah spake thus to the Ifrit Dahnash, "Sure am I that the
like of my beloved is not in this world! Art thou mad to fellow
thy beloved with my beloved?" He said, "Allah upon thee, O
my lady, go back with me and look upon my mistress, and after I
will return with thee and look upon thy beloved." She answered,
"It must needs be so, O accursed, for thou art a knavish devil;
but I will not go with thee nor shalt thou come with me, save upon
condition of a wager which is this. If the lover thou lovest and
of whom thou boastest so bravely, prove handsomer than mine
whom I mentioned and whom I love and of whom I boast, the bet
shall be thine against me; but if my beloved prove the handsomer
the bet shall be mine against thee." Quoth Dahnash the Ifrit,
"O my lady, I accept this thy wager and am satisfied thereat; so
come with me to the Islands." Quoth Maymunah; "No! for the
abode of my beloved is nearer than the abode of thine: here it is
under us; so come down with me to see my beloved and after we
will go look upon thy mistress." "I hear and I obey," said Dahnash.
So they descended to earth and alighted in the saloon which
the tower contained; then Maymunah stationed Dahnash beside
the bed and, putting out her hand, drew back the silken coverlet
from Kamar al-Zaman's face, when it glittered and glistened and
shimmered and shone like the rising sun. She gazed at him for a
moment, then turning sharply round upon Dahnash said, "Look,
O accursed, and be not the basest of madmen; I am a maid, yet
my heart he hath waylaid." So Dahnash looked at the Prince
and long continued gazing steadfastly on him then, shaking his
head, said to Maymunah, "By Allah, O my lady, thou art excusable;
but there is yet another thing to be considered, and this is,
that the estate female differeth from the male. By Allah's might,
this thy beloved is the likest of all created things to my mistress
in beauty and loveliness and grace and perfection; and it is as
though they were both cast alike in the mould of seemlihead."
Now when Maymunah heard these words, the light became darkness
in her sight and she dealt him with her wing so fierce a buffet
on the head as well-nigh made an end of him. Then quoth she
to him, "I conjure thee, by the light of his glorious countenance,
go at once, O accursed, and bring hither thy mistress whom thou
lovest so fondly and foolishly, and return in haste that we may lay
the twain together and look on them both as they lie asleep side
by side; so shall it appear to us which be the goodlier and more
beautiful of the two. Except thou obey me this very moment, O
accursed, I will dart my sparks at thee with my fire and consume
thee; yea, in pieces I will rend thee and into the deserts cast thee,
that to stay-at-home and wayfarer an example thou be!" Quoth
Dahnash, "O my lady, I will do thy behests, for I know forsure
that my mistress is the fairer and the sweeter." So saying the
Ifrit flew away and Maymunah flew with him to guard him. They
were absent awhile and presently returned, bearing the young lady,
who was clad in a shift of fine Venetian silk, with a double edging
of gold and purfled with the most exquisite of embroidery having
these couplets worked upon the ends of the sleeves:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Three matters hinder her from visiting us, in fear ✿ Of hate-full, slandering envier and his hirèd spies:</div>
      <div class="line">The shining light of brow, the trinkets' tinkling voice, ✿ And scent of essences that tell whene'er she hies:</div>
      <div class="line">Gi'en that she hide her brow with edge of sleeve, and leave ✿ At home her trinketry, how shall her scent disguise?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1484" id="noteref-1484" epub:type="noteref">1484</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And Dahnash and Maymunah stinted not bearing that young lady
till they had carried her into the saloon and had laid her beside
the youth Kamar al-Zaman.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c004">

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Ifrit
Dahnash and the Ifritah Maymunah stinted not bearing Princess
Budur till they descended and laid her on the couch beside Kamar
al-Zaman. Then they uncovered both their faces, and they were
the likest of all folk, each to other, as they were twins or an only
brother and sister; and indeed they were a seduction to the pious,
even as saith of them the poet Al-Mubín:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O heart! be not thy love confined to one, ✿ Lest thou by doting or disdain be undone:</div>
      <div class="line">Love all the fair, and thou shalt find with them ✿ If this be lost, to thee that shall be won.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And quoth another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Mine eyes beheld two lying on the ground; ✿ Both had I loved if on these eyne they lay!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So Dahnash and Maymunah gazed on them awhile, and he said,
"By Allah, O my lady, it is good! My mistress is assuredly the
fairer." She replied, "Not so, my beloved is the fairer; woe to
thee, O Dahnash! Art blind of eye and heart that lean from fat
thou canst not depart? Wilt thou hide the truth? Dost thou
not see his beauty and loveliness and fine stature and symmetry?
Out on thee, hear what I purpose to say in praise of my beloved
and, if thou be a lover true to her thou dost love, do thou the like
for her thou lovest." Then she kissed Kamar al-Zaman again
and again between the eyes and improvised this ode:—</p>

<p>When Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in
praise of her beloved, he joyed with exceeding joy and marvelled
with excessive wonderment.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Ifrit Dahnash heard the poesy which Maymunah spake in praise
of her beloved, he shook for exceeding joy and said, "Thou hast
celebrated thy beloved in song and thou hast indeed done well
in praise of him whom thou lovest! And there is no help for it
but that I also in my turn do my best to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">enfame</span> my mistress,
and recite somewhat in her honour." Then the Ifrit went up to
the lady Budur; and, kissing her between the eyes, looked at
Maymunah and at his beloved Princess and recited the following
verses, albeit he had no skill in poesy:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">

</div>

<p>When Maymunah heard these lines from the Ifrit, she said, "Thou
hast done well, O Dahnash! But say thou which of the two is the
handsomer?" And he answered, "My mistress Budur is handsomer
than thy beloved!" Cried Maymunah, "Thou liest, O
accursed. Nay, my beloved is more beautiful than thine!" But
Dahnash persisted, "Mine is the fairer." And they ceased not
to wrangle and challenge each other's words till Maymunah cried
out at Dahnash and would have laid violent hands on him; but
he humbled himself to her and, softening his speech, said, "Let
not the truth be a grief to thee, and cease we this talk, for all we
say is to testify in favour of our lovers; rather let each of us withdraw
the claim and seek we one who shall judge fairly between
us which of the two be fairer; and by his sentence we will abide."
"I agree to this," answered she and smote the earth with her foot,
whereupon there came out of it an Ifrit blind of an eye, humpbacked
and scurvy-skinned, with eye-orbits slit up and down his
face.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1492" id="noteref-1492" epub:type="noteref">1492</a> On his head were seven horns and four locks of hair fell
to his heels; his hands were pitchfork-like and his legs mast-like
and he had nails as the claws of a lion, and feet as the hoofs of the
wild ass.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1493" id="noteref-1493" epub:type="noteref">1493</a> When that Ifrit rose out of the earth and sighted Maymunah,
he kissed the ground before her and, standing with his
hands clasped behind him, said, "What is thy will, O my mistress,
O daughter of my King?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1494" id="noteref-1494" epub:type="noteref">1494</a> She replied, "O Kashkash, I
would have thee judge between me and this accursed Dahnash."
And she made known to him the matter, from first to last, whereupon
the Ifrit Kashkash looked at the face of the youth and then
at the face of the girl; and saw them lying asleep, embraced,
each with an arm under the other's neck, alike in beauty and
loveliness and equal in grace and goodliness. The Marid gazed
long upon them, marvelling at their seemlihead; and, after carefully
observing the twain, he turned to Maymunah and Dahnash,
and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Go, visit her thou lovest, and regard not</div>
      <div class="line">The words detractors utter; envious churls</div>
      <div class="line">Can never favour love. Oh! sure the Merciful</div>
      <div class="line">Ne'er made a thing more fair to look upon,</div>
      <div class="line">Than two fond lovers in each others' arms,</div>
      <div class="line">Speaking their passion in a mute embrace.</div>
      <div class="line">When heart has turned to heart, the fools would part them</div>
      <div class="line">Strike idly on cold steel. So when thou 'st found</div>
      <div class="line">One purely, wholly thine, accept her true heart,</div>
      <div class="line">And live for her alone. Oh! thou that blamest</div>
      <div class="line">The love-struck for their love, give o'er thy talk,</div>
      <div class="line">How canst thou minister to a mind diseased?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1495" id="noteref-1495" epub:type="noteref">1495</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he turned again to Maymunah and Dahnash and said to
them, "By Allah, if you will have the truth, I tell you fairly the
twain be equal in beauty, and loveliness and perfect grace and
goodliness, nor can I make any difference between them on account
of their being man and woman. But I have another thought
which is that we wake each of them in turn, without the knowledge
of the other, and whichever is the more enamoured shall
be held inferior in seemlihead and comeliness." Quoth Maymunah,
"Right is this recking," and quoth Dahnash, "I consent to this."
Then Dahnash changed himself to the form of a flea and bit
Kamar al-Zaman, whereupon he started from sleep in a fright——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Dahnash
changed himself to the form of a flea and bit Kamar al-Zaman
who started from sleep in a fright and rubbed the bitten part,
his neck, and scratched it hard because of the smart. Then
turning sideways, he found lying by him something whose breath
was sweeter than musk and whose skin was softer than cream.
Hereat marvelled he with great marvel and he sat up and looked
at what lay beside him; when he saw it to be a young lady like
an union pearl, or a shining sun, or a dome seen from afar on a
well-built wall; for she was five feet tall, with a shape like the
letter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1496" id="noteref-1496" epub:type="noteref">1496</a> <span lang="ar" xml:lang="ar" xml:lang="ar">ا</span>, bosomed high and rosy-cheeked; even as saith of her
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Four things which ne'er conjoin, unless it be ✿ To storm my vitals and to shed my blood:</div>
      <div class="line">Brow white as day and tresses black as night ✿ Cheeks rosy red and lips which smiles o'erflood.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And also quoth another:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A Moon she rises, Willow-wand she waves, ✿ Breathes Ambergris, and gazes, a Gazelle:</div>
      <div class="line">Meseems that sorrow wooes my heart and wins ✿ And, when she wendeth hastes therein to dwell!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Kamar al-Zaman saw the lady Budur, daughter of
King Ghayur, and her beauty and comeliness, she was sleeping
clad in a shift of Venetian silk, without her petticoat-trousers,
and wore on her head a kerchief embroidered with gold and set
with stones of price: her ears were hung with twin earrings
which shone like constellations and round her neck was a collar
of union pearls, of size unique, past the competence of any King.
When he saw this, his reason was confounded and natural heat
began to stir in him; Allah awoke in him the desire of coition
and he said to himself, "Whatso Allah willeth, that shall be,
and what He willeth not shall never be!" So saying, he put
out his hand and, turning her over, loosed the collar of her
chemise; then arose before his sight her bosom, with its breasts
like double globes of ivory; whereat his inclination for her redoubled
and he desired her with exceeding hot desire. He
would have awakened her but she would not awake, for Dahnash
had made her sleep heavy; so he shook her and moved her,
saying, "O my beloved, awake and look on me; I am Kamar
al-Zaman." But she awoke not, neither moved her head; whereupon
he considered her case for a long hour and said to himself,
"If I guess aright, this is the damsel to whom my father would
have married me and these three years past I have refused her;
but Inshallah!—God willing—as soon as it is dawn, I will say to
him:—Marry me to her, that I may enjoy her."——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman said to himself, "By Allah, when I see dawn I will say
to my sire:—Marry me to her that I may enjoy her; nor will I let
half the day pass ere I possess her and take my fill of her beauty
and loveliness." Then he bent over Budur to buss her, whereat
the Jinniyah Maymunah trembled and was abashed and Dahnash,
the Ifrit, was like to fly for joy. But, as Kamar al-Zaman was
about to kiss her upon the mouth, he was ashamed before Allah
and turned away his head and averted his face, saying to his heart,
"Have patience." Then he took thought awhile and said, "I will
be patient; haply my father when he was wroth with me and sent
me to this jail, may have brought my young lady and made her
lie by my side to try me with her, and may have charged her not
to be readily awakened when I would arouse her, and may have
said to her:—Whatever thing Kamar al-Zaman do to thee, make
me ware thereof; or belike my sire standeth hidden in some stead
whence (being himself unseen) he can see all I do with this young
lady; and to-morrow he will scold me and cry:—How cometh it
that thou sayest, I have no mind to marry; and yet thou didst
kiss and embrace yonder damsel? So I will withhold myself lest
I be ashamed before my sire; and the right and proper thing to
do is not to touch her at this present, nor even to look upon her,
except to take from her somewhat which shall serve as a token to
me and a memorial of her; that some sign endure between me
and her." Then Kamar al-Zaman raised the young lady's hand
and took from her little finger a seal-ring worth an immense
amount of money, for that its bezel was a precious jewel and
around it were graven these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Count not that I your promises forgot, ✿ Despite the length of your delinquencies:</div>
      <div class="line">Be generous, O my lord, to me inclining; ✿ Haply your mouth and cheeks these lips may kiss:</div>
      <div class="line">By Allah, ne'er will I relinquish you ✿ Albe you <em>will</em> transgress love's boundaries.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Kamar al-Zaman took the seal-ring from the little finger of
Queen Budur and set it on his own; then, turning his back to her,
went to sleep.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1497" id="noteref-1497" epub:type="noteref">1497</a> When Maymunah the Jinniyah saw this, she was
glad and said to Dahnash and Kashkash, "Saw ye how my beloved
Kamar al-Zaman bore himself chastely towards this young lady?
Verily, this was of the perfection of his good gifts; for observe
you twain how he looked on her and noted her beauty and loveliness,
and yet embraced her not neither kissed her nor put his
hand to her, but turned his back and slept." Answered they,
"Even so!" Thereupon Maymunah changed herself into a flea
and entering into the raiment of Budur, the loved of Dahnash,
crept up her calf and came upon her thigh and, reaching a place
some four carats<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1498" id="noteref-1498" epub:type="noteref">1498</a> below her navel, there bit her. Thereupon she
opened her eyes and sitting up in bed, saw a youth lying beside
her and breathing heavily in his sleep, the loveliest of Almighty
Allah's creatures, with eyes that put to shame the fairest Houris
of Heaven; and a mouth like Solomon's seal, whose water was
sweeter to the taste and more efficacious than a theriack, and lips
the colour of coral-stone, and cheeks like the blood-red anemone,
even as saith one, describing him in these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My mind's withdrawn from Zaynab and Nawár<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1499" id="noteref-1499" epub:type="noteref">1499</a> ✿ By rosy cheeks that growth of myrtle bear;</div>
      <div class="line">I love a fawn, a tunic-vested boy, ✿ And leave the love of bracelet-wearing Fair:</div>
      <div class="line">My mate in hall and closet is unlike ✿ Her that I play with, as at home we pair.</div>
      <div class="line">Oh thou, who blam'st my flight from Hind and Zaynab, ✿ The cause is clear as dawn uplighting air!</div>
      <div class="line">Would'st have me fare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1500" id="noteref-1500" epub:type="noteref">1500</a> a slave, the thrall of thrall, ✿ Cribbed, pent, confined behind the bar and wall?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Princess Budur saw him, she was seized by a transport
of passion and yearning and love-longing,——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Princess Budur saw Kamar al-Zaman she was forthwith seized
with a transport of passion and yearning and love-longing, and
she said to herself, "Alas, my shame! This is a strange youth
and I know him not. How cometh he to be lying by my side
on one bed?" Then she looked at him a second time and
noting his beauty and loveliness, said, "By Allah, he is indeed
a comely youth and my heart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1501" id="noteref-1501" epub:type="noteref">1501</a> is well-nigh torn in sunder with
longing for him! But alas, how am I shamed by him! By the
Almighty, had I known it was this youth who sought me in marriage
of my father, I had not rejected him, but had wived with him
and enjoyed his loveliness!" Then she gazed in his face and said,
"O my lord and light of mine eyes, awake from sleep and take
thy pleasure in my beauty and grace." And she moved him with
her hand; but Maymunah the Jinniyah let down sleep upon him
as it were a curtain, and pressed heavily on his head with her
wings so that Kamar al-Zaman awoke not. Then Princess Budur
shook him with her hands and said, "My life on thee, hearken to
me; awake and up from thy sleep and look on the narcissus and
the tender down thereon, and enjoy the sight of naked waist and
navel; and touzle me and tumble me from this moment till break
of day! Allah upon thee, O my lord, sit up and prop thee against
the pillow and slumber not!" Still Kamar al-Zaman made her no
reply but breathed hard in his sleep. Continued she, "Alas! Alas!
thou art insolent in thy beauty and comeliness and grace and
loving looks! But if thou art handsome, so am I handsome; what
then is this thou dost? Have they taught thee to flout me or hath
my father, the wretched old fellow,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1502" id="noteref-1502" epub:type="noteref">1502</a> made thee swear not to speak
to me to-night?" But Kamar al-Zaman opened not his mouth
neither awoke, whereat her passion for him redoubled and Allah
inflamed her heart with love of him. She stole one glance of eyes
that cost her a thousand sighs: her heart fluttered, and her vitals
throbbed and her hands and feet quivered; and she said to Kamar
al-Zaman "Talk to me, O my lord! Speak to me, O my friend!
Answer me, O my beloved, and tell me thy name, for indeed thou
hast ravished my wit!" And during all this time he abode
drowned in sleep and answered her not a word, and Princess Budur
sighed and said, "Alas! Alas! why art thou so proud and self-satisfied?"
Then she shook him and turning his hand over, saw
her seal-ring on his little finger, whereat she cried a loud cry, and
followed it with a sigh of passion and said, "Alack! Alack! By
Allah, thou art my beloved and thou lovest me! Yet thou seemest
to turn thee away from me out of coquetry, for all, O my darling,
thou camest to me, whilst I was asleep and knew not what thou
didst with me, and tookest my seal-ring; and yet I will not pull
it off thy finger." So saying, she opened the bosom of his shirt
and bent over him and kissed him and put forth her hand to him,
seeking somewhat that she might take as a token, but found
nothing. Then she thrust her hand into his breast and, because of
the smoothness of his body, it slipped down to his waist and thence
to his navel and thence to his yard, whereupon her heart ached and
her vitals quivered and lust was sore upon her, for that the desire
of women is fiercer than the desire of men,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1503" id="noteref-1503" epub:type="noteref">1503</a> and she was ashamed
of her own shamelessness. Then she plucked his seal-ring from
his finger, and put it on her own instead of the ring he had taken,
and bussed his inner lips and hands, nor did she leave any part
of him unkissed; after which she took him to her breast and
embraced him and, laying one of her hands under his neck and
the other under his armpit, nestled close to him and fell asleep by
his side——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
to say her permitted say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Princess Budur fell asleep by the side of Kamar al-Zaman, after
doing that which she did, quoth Maymunah to Dahnash, "Sawst
thou, O accursed, how proudly and coquettishly my beloved bore
himself, and how hotly and passionately thy mistress showed
herself to my dearling? There can be no doubt that my beloved
is handsomer than thine; nevertheless I pardon thee." Then she
wrote him a document of manumission and turned to Kashkash
and said, "Go, help Dahnash to take up his mistress and aid him
to carry her back to her own place, for the night waneth apace and
there is but little left of it." "I hear and I obey;" answered
Kashkash. So the two Ifrits went forward to Princess Budur and
upraising her flew away with her; then, bearing her back to
her own place, they laid her on her bed, whilst Maymunah abode
alone with Kamar al-Zaman, gazing upon him as he slept, till the
night was all but spent, when she went her way. As soon as
morning morrowed, the Prince awoke from sleep and turned right
and left, but found not the maiden by him and said in his mind,
"What is this business? It is as if my father would incline me to
marriage with the damsel who was with me and have now taken
her away by stealth, to the intent that my desire for wedlock may
redouble." Then he called out to the eunuch who slept at the
door, saying, "Woe to thee, O damned one, arise at once!" So
the eunuch rose, bemused with sleep, and brought him basin and
ewer, whereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered the water-closet and
did his need;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1504" id="noteref-1504" epub:type="noteref">1504</a> then, coming out made the Wuzu-ablution and
prayed the dawn-prayer, after which he sat telling on his beads the
ninety-and-nine names of Almighty Allah. Then he looked up
and, seeing the eunuch standing in service upon him, said, "Out on
thee, O Sawáb! Who was it came hither and took away the
young lady from my side and I still sleeping?" Asked the eunuch,
"O my lord, what manner of young lady?" "The young lady
who lay with me last night," replied Kamar al-Zaman. The
eunuch was startled at his words and said to him, "By Allah, there
hath been with thee neither young lady nor other! How should
young lady have come in to thee, when I was sleeping in the
doorway and the door was locked? By Allah, O my lord, neither
male nor female hath come in to thee!" Exclaimed the Prince,
"Thou liest, O pestilent slave!: is it of thy competence also to
hoodwink me and refuse to tell me what is become of the young
lady who lay with me last night and decline to inform me who
took her away?" Replied the eunuch (and he was affrighted at
him), "By Allah, O my lord, I have seen neither young lady nor
young lord!" His words only angered Kamar al-Zaman the
more and he said to him, "O accursed one, my father hath indeed
taught thee deceit! Come hither." So the eunuch came up to
him, and the Prince took him by the collar and dashed him to the
ground; whereupon he let fly a loud fart<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1505" id="noteref-1505" epub:type="noteref">1505</a> and Kamar al-Zaman,
kneeling upon him, kicked him and throttled him till he fainted
away. Then he dragged him forth and tied him to the well-rope,
and let him down like a bucket into the well and plunged him
into the water, then drew him up and lowered him down again.
Now it was hard winter weather, and Kamar al-Zaman ceased not
to plunge the eunuch into the water and pull him up again and
douse him and haul him whilst he screamed and called for help;
and the Prince kept on saying "By Allah, O damned one, I will
not draw thee up out of this well till thou tell me and fully
acquaint me with the story of the young lady and who it was took
her away, whilst I slept."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman said to the eunuch, "By Allah! I will not draw thee
up out of this well until thou tell me the story of the young lady
and who it was took her away whilst I slept." Answered the
eunuch, after he had seen death staring him in the face; "O my
lord, let me go and I will relate to thee the truth and the whole
tale." So Kamar al-Zaman pulled him up out of the well, all
but dead for suffering, what with cold and the pain of dipping and
dousing, drubbing and dread of drowning. He shook like cane
in hurricane, his teeth were clenched as by cramp and his clothes
were drenched and his body befouled and torn by the rough sides
of the well: briefly he was in a sad pickle. Now when Kamar
al-Zaman saw him in this sorry plight, he was concerned for him;
but, as soon as the eunuch found himself on the floor, he said to
him,"O my lord, let me go and doff my clothes and wring them
out and spread them in the sun to dry, and don others; after
which I will return to thee forthwith and tell thee the truth of the
matter." Answered the Prince, "O rascal slave! hadst thou not
seen death face to face, never hadst thou confessed to fact nor
told me a word; but go now and do thy will, and then come back
to me at once and tell me the truth." Thereupon the eunuch
went out, hardly crediting his escape, and ceased not running,
stumbling and rising in his haste, till he came in to King Shahriman,
whom he found sitting at talk with his Wazir of Kamar al-Zaman's
case. The King was saying to the Minister, "I slept not last
night, for anxiety concerning my son, Kamar al-Zaman, and
indeed I fear lest some harm befal him in that old tower. What
good was there in imprisoning him?" Answered the Wazir,
"Have no care for him. By Allah, no harm will befal him!
None at all! Leave him in prison for a month till his temper
yield and his spirit be broken and he return to his senses." As
the two spoke behold, up rushed the eunuch, in the aforesaid
plight, making the King who was troubled at sight of him; and
he cried "O our lord the Sultan! Verily, thy son's wits are fled
and he hath gone mad; he hath dealt with me thus and thus, so
that I am become as thou seest me, and he kept saying:—A young
lady lay with me this night and stole away secretly whilst I slept.
Where is she? And he insisteth on my letting him know where
she is and on my telling him who took her away. But I have seen
neither girl nor boy: the door was locked all through the night,
for I slept before it with the key under my head, and I opened to
him in the morning with my own hand." When King Shahriman
heard this, he cried out, saying, "Alas, my son!;" and he was
enraged with sore rage against the Wazir, who had been the cause
of all this case and said to him, "Go up, bring me news of my son
and see what hath befallen his mind." So the Wazir rose and,
stumbling over his long skirts, in his fear of the King's wrath,
hastened with the slave to the tower. Now the sun had risen and
when the Minister came in to Kamar al-Zaman, he found him
sitting on the couch reciting the Koran; so he saluted him and
seated himself by his side, and said to him, "O my lord, this
wretched eunuch brought us tidings which troubled and alarmed
us and which incensed the King." Asked Kamar al-Zaman, "And
what hath he told you of me to trouble my father? In good sooth
he hath troubled none but me." Answered the Wazir, "He came
to us in fulsome state and told us of thee a thing which Heaven
forfend; and the slave added a lie which it befitteth not to repeat,
Allah preserve thy youth and sound sense and tongue of eloquence,
and forbid to come from thee aught of offence!" Quoth
the Prince,"O Wazir, and what thing did this pestilent slave say
of me?" The Minister replied, "He told us that thy wits had
taken leave of thee and thou wouldst have it that a young lady lay
with thee last night, and thou wast instant with him to tell thee
whither she went and thou diddest torture him to that end." But
when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was enraged with
sore rage and he said to the Wazir, "'Tis manifest to me in very
deed that you people taught the eunuch to do as he did"——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted
say.</p>

bosom last night; for it was you who sent her and bade her sleep
in my embrace and we lay together till dawn; but, when I awoke,
I found her not. So where is she now?" Said the Wazir, "O
my lord Kamar al-Zaman, Allah's name encompass thee about!
By the Almighty, we sent none to thee last night, but thou
layest alone, with the door locked on thee and the eunuch sleeping
behind it, nor did there come to thee young lady or any other.
Regain thy reason, O my lord, and stablish thy senses and occupy
not thy mind with vanities." Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman who was
incensed at his words, "O Wazir, the young lady in question is my
beloved, the fair one with the black eyes and rosy cheeks, whom I
held in my arms all last night." So the Minister wondered at his
words and asked him, "Didst thou see this damsel last night with
thine own eyes on wake or in sleep?" Answered Kamar al-Zaman,
"O ill-omened old man, dost thou fancy I saw her with my ears?
Indeed, I saw her with my very eyes and awake, and I touched
her with my hand, and I watched by her full half the night, feeding
my vision on her beauty and loveliness and grace and tempting
looks. But you had schooled her and charged her to speak no
word to me; so she feigned sleep and I lay by her side till dawn,
when I awoke and found her gone." Rejoined the Wazir, "O my
lord Kamar al-Zaman, haply thou sawest this in thy sleep; it
must have been a delusion of dreams or a deception caused by
eating various kinds of food, or a suggestion of the accursed
devils." Cried the Prince, "O pestilent old man! wilt thou too
make a mock of me and tell me this was haply a delusion of
dreams, when that eunuch confessed to the young lady, saying:—At
once I will return to thee and tell thee all about her?" With
these words, he sprang up and rushed at the Wazir and gripped
hold of his beard (which was long<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1506" id="noteref-1506" epub:type="noteref">1506</a>) and, after gripping it, he
twisted his hand in it and haling him off the couch, threw him on
the floor. It seemed to the Minister as though his soul departed
his body for the violent plucking at his beard; and Kamar al-Zaman
ceased not kicking the Wazir and basting his breast and
ribs and cuffing him with open hand on the nape of his neck till he
had well-nigh beaten him to death. Then said the old man in his
mind, "Just as the eunuch-slave saved his life from this lunatic youth
by telling him a lie, thus it is even fitter that I do likewise; else he
will destroy me. So now for my lie to save myself, he being mad
beyond a doubt." Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said,
"O my lord, pardon me; for indeed thy father charged me to conceal
from thee this affair of the young lady; but now I am weak
and weary and wounded with tunding; for I am an old man and
lack strength and bottom to endure blows. Have, therefore, a little
patience with me and I will tell thee all and acquaint thee with
the story of the young woman." When the Prince heard this, he
left off drubbing him and said, "Wherefore couldst thou not tell
me the tale until after shame and blows? Rise now, unlucky old
man that thou art, and tell me her story." Quoth the Wazir,
"Say, dost thou ask of the young lady with the fair face and
perfect form?" Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, "Even so! Tell me,
O Wazir, who it was that led her to me and laid her by my
side, and who was it that took her away from me by night;
and let me know forthright whither she is gone, that I myself
may go to her at once. If my father did this deed to me that
he might try me by means of that beautiful girl, with a view to
our marriage, I consent to wed her and free myself of this trouble;
for he did all these dealings with me only because I refused wedlock.
But now I consent and I say again, I consent to matrimony:
so tell this to my father, O Wazir, and advise him to marry me to
that young lady; for I will have none other and my heart loveth
none save her alone. Now rise up at once and haste thee to my
father and counsel him to hurry on our wedding and bring me his
answer within this very hour." Rejoined the Wazir, "'Tis well!"
and went forth from him, hardly believing himself out of his hands.
Then he set off from the tower, walking and tripping up as he
went, for excess of fright and agitation, and he ceased not hurrying
till he came in to King Shahriman.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir
fared forth from the tower, and ceased not running till he came in
to King Shahriman, who said to him as he sighted him, "O thou
Wazir, what man hath brought thee to grief and whose mischief
hath treated thee in way unlief; how happeneth it that I see thee
dumb-foundered and coming to me thus astounded?" Replied
the Wazir, "O King! I bring thee good news." "And what is
it?" quoth Shariman, and quoth the Wazir, "Know that thy son
Kamar al-Zaman's wits are clean gone and that he hath become
stark mad." Now when the King heard these words of the Minister,
light became darkness in his sight and he said, "O Wazir,
make clear to me the nature of his madness." Answered the
Wazir, "O my lord, I hear and I obey." Then he told him that
such and such had passed and acquainted him with all that his son
had done; whereupon the King said to him, "Hear, O Wazir, the
good tidings which I give thee in return for this thy fair news of
my son's insanity; and it shall be the cutting off of thy head and
the forfeiture of my favour, O most ill-omened of Wazirs and
foulest of Emirs! for I feel that thou hast caused my son's disorder
by the wicked advice and the sinister counsel thou hast
given me first and last. By Allah, if aught of mischief or madness
have befallen my son I will most assuredly nail thee upon the
palace-dome and make thee drain the bitterest draught of death!"
Then he sprang up and, taking the Wazir with him, fared straight
for the tower and entered it. And when Kamar al-Zaman saw
the two, he rose to his father in haste from the couch whereon he
sat and kissing his hands drew back and hung down his head and
stood before him with his arms behind him, and thus remained for
a full hour. Then he raised his head towards his sire; the tears
gushed from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks and he began
repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"Forgive the sin 'neath which my limbs are trembling,</div>
      <div class="line">For the slave seeks for mercy from his master;</div>
      <div class="line">I've done a fault, which calls for free confession,</div>
      <div class="line">Where shall it call for mercy, and forgiveness?"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1507" id="noteref-1507" epub:type="noteref">1507</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the King heard this, he arose and embraced his son, and
kissing him between the eyes, made him sit by his side on the
couch; then he turned to the Wazir and, looking on him with
eyes of wrath, said, "O dog of Wazirs, how didst thou say of
my son such and such things and make my heart quake for
him?" Then he turned to the Prince and said, "O my son, what
is to-day called?" He answered, "O my father, this day is the
Sabbath, and to-morrow is First day: then come Second day,
Third, Fourth, Fifth day and lastly Friday."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1508" id="noteref-1508" epub:type="noteref">1508</a> Exclaimed the
King, "O my son, O Kamar al-Zaman, praised be Allah for the
preservation of thy reason! What is the present month called in
our Arabic?" "Zú'l-Ka'adah," answered Kamar al-Zaman, "and
it is followed by Zú'l-hijjah; then cometh Muharram, then Safar,
then Rabí'a the First and Rabí'a the Second, the two Jamádás,
Rajab, Sha aban, Ramazán and Shawwál." At this the King
rejoiced exceedingly and spat in the Wazir's face, saying, "O
wicked old man, how canst thou say that my son is mad? And
now none is mad but thou." Hereupon the Minister shook his
head and would have spoken, but bethought himself to wait awhile
and see what might next befal. Then the King said to his child,
"O my son, what words be these thou saidest to the eunuch and
the Wazir, declaring:—I was sleeping with a fair damsel this
night?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1509" id="noteref-1509" epub:type="noteref">1509</a> What damsel is this of whom thou speakest?" Then
Kamar al-Zaman laughed at his father's words and replied, "O
my father, know that I can bear no more jesting; so add me not
another mock or even a single word on the matter, for my temper
hath waxed short by that you have done with me. And know, O
my father, with assured knowledge, that I consent to marry, but
on condition that thou give me to wife her who lay by my side
this night; for I am certain it was thou sentest her to me and
madest me in love with her and then despatchedst a message to
her before the dawn and tookest her away from beside me." Rejoined
the King, "The name of Allah encompass thee about,
O my son, and be thy wit preserved from witlessness!"——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth King
Shahriman to his son Kamar al-Zaman, "The name of Allah encompass
thee about, O my son, and be thy wit preserved from
witlessness! What thing be this young lady whom thou fanciest I
sent to thee last night and then again that I sent to withdraw her
from thee before dawn? By the Lord, O my son, I know nothing
of this affair, and Allah upon thee, tell me if it be a delusion of
dreaming or a deception caused by indisposition. For verily thou
layest down to sleep last night with thy mind occupied anent
marriage and troubled with the talk of it (Allah damn marriage
and the hour when I spake of it and curse him who counselled it!);
and without doubt or diffidence I can say that being moved in
mind by the mention of wedlock thou dreamedst that a handsome
young lady embraced thee and didst fancy thou sawest her when
awake. But all this, O my son, is but an imbroglio of dreams."
Replied Kamar al-Zaman, "Leave this talk and swear to me by
Allah, the All-creator, the Omniscient; the Humbler of the tyrant
Cæsars and the Destroyer of the Chosroes, that thou knowest
naught of the young lady nor of her woning-place." Quoth the
King, "By the Might of Allah Almighty, the God of Moses and
Abraham, I know naught of all this and never even heard of it;
it is assuredly a delusion of dreams thou hast seen in sleep."
Then the Prince replied to his sire, "I will give thee a self-evident
proof that it happened to me when on wake."——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Ninety-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman said to his sire, "I will give thee a self-evident proof that
this happened to me when on wake. Now let me ask thee, did it
ever befal any man to dream that he was battling a sore battle and
after to awake from sleep and find in his hand a sword-blade besmeared
with blood? Answered the King, "No, by Allah, O my
son, this hath never been." Rejoined Kamar al-Zaman, "I will
tell thee what happened to me and it was this. Meseemed I
awoke from sleep in the middle of the past night and found a girl
lying by my side, whose form was like mine and whose favour was
as mine. I embraced her and turned her about with my hand and
took her seal-ring, which I put on my finger, and she pulled off
my ring and put it on hers. Then I went to sleep by her side,
but refrained from her for shame of thee, deeming that thou hadst
sent her to me, intending to tempt me with her and incline me to
marriage, and suspecting thee to be hidden somewhere whence
thou couldst see what I did with her. And I was ashamed even
to kiss her on the mouth for thy account, thinking over this temptation
to wedlock; and, when I awoke at point of day, I found no
trace of her, nor could I come at any news of her, and there befel
me what thou knowest of with the eunuch and with the Wazir.
How then can this case have been a dream and a delusion, when
the ring is a reality? Save for her ring on my finger I should
indeed have deemed it a dream; but here is the ring on my little
finger: look at it, O King, and see what is its worth." So saying,
he handed the ring to his father, who examined it and turned it
over, then looked to his son and said, "Verily, there is in this ring
some mighty mystery and some strange secret. What befel thee
last night with the girl is indeed a hard nut to crack, and I know
not how intruded upon us this intruder. None is the cause of all
this pother save the Wazir; but, Allah upon thee, O my son, take
patience, so haply the Lord may turn to gladness this thy grief
and to thy sadness bring complete relief: as quoth one of the
poets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Haply shall Fortune draw her rein, and bring ✿ Fair chance, for she is changeful, jealous, vain:</div>
      <div class="line">Still I may woo my want and wishes win, ✿ And see on heels of care unfain, the fain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And now, O my son, I am certified at this hour that thou art not
mad; but thy case is a strange one which none can clear up for
thee save the Almighty." Cried the Prince, "By Allah, O my
father, deal kindly with me and seek out this young lady and
hasten her coming to me; else I shall die of woe and of my death
shall no one know." Then he betrayed the ardour of his passion;
and turned towards his father and repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">If your promise of personal call prove untrue, ✿ Deign in vision to grant me an interview:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, after ending his poetry, Kamar al-Zaman again turned to
his father, with submission and despondency, and shedding tears
in flood, began repeating these lines——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Ninety-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Kamar al-Zaman had repeated to his father these verses, he wept
and complained and groaned from a wounded heart; and added
these lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Beware that eye-glance which hath magic might; ✿ Wherever turn those orbs it bars our flight:</div>
      <div class="line">Nor be deceived by low sweet voice, that breeds ✿ A fever festering in the heart and sprite:</div>
      <div class="line">So soft that silky skin, were rose to touch it ✿ She'd cry and tear-drops rain for pain and fright:</div>
      <div class="line">Did Zephyr e'en in sleep pass o'er her land, ✿ Scented he'd choose to dwell in scented site:</div>
      <div class="line">Her necklets vie with tinkling of her belt; ✿ Her wrists strike either wristlet dumb with spite:</div>
      <div class="line">When would her bangles buss those rings in ear, ✿ Upon the lover's eyne high mysteries 'light:</div>
      <div class="line">I'm blamed for love of her, nor pardon claim; ✿ Eyes are not profiting which lack foresight:</div>
      <div class="line">Heaven strip thee, blamer mine! unjust art thou; ✿ Before this fawn must every eye low bow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1511" id="noteref-1511" epub:type="noteref">1511</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>After which he said, "By Allah, O my father, I cannot endure
to be parted from her even for an hour." The King smote hand
upon hand and exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there is no
Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! No cunning contrivance
can profit us in this affair." Then he took his son by
the hand and carried him to the palace, where Kamar al-Zaman
lay down on the bed of languor and the King sat at his head,
weeping and mourning over him and leaving him not, night or
day, till at last the Wazir came in to him and said, "O King
of the age and the time, how long wilt thou remain shut up with
thy son and hide thyself from thy troops? Haply, the order of
thy realm may be deranged, by reason of thine absence from thy
Grandees and Officers of State. It behoveth the man of understanding,
if he have various wounds in his body, to apply him
first to medicine the most dangerous; so it is my counsel to thee
that thou remove thy son from this place to the pavilion which is
in the palace overlooking the sea; and shut thyself up with him
there, setting apart in every week two days, Thursday and Monday,
for state receptions and progresses and reviews. On these days
let thine Emirs and Wazirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and
high Officials and Grandees of the realm and the rest of the levies
and the lieges have access to thee and submit their affairs to thee;
and do thou their needs and judge among them and give and take
with them and bid and forbid. And the rest of the week thou
shalt pass with thy son, Kamar al-Zaman, and cease not thus doing
till Allah shall vouchsafe relief to you twain. Think not, O King,
that thou art safe from the shifts of Time and the strokes of Change
which come like a traveller in the night; for the wise man is ever
on his guard and how well saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thou deemedst well of Time when days went well, ✿ And fearedst not what ills might bring thee Fate:</div>
      <div class="line">The Nights so fair and restful cozened thee, ✿ For peaceful Nights bring woes of heavy weight.</div>
      <div class="line">Oh children of mankind whom Time befriends, ✿ Beware of Time's deceits or soon or late!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1512" id="noteref-1512" epub:type="noteref">1512</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the Sultan heard his Wazir's words he saw that they were
right and deemed his counsel wise, and it had effect upon him for
he feared lest the order of the state be deranged; so he rose at
once and bade transport his son from his sick room to the pavilion
in the palace overlooking the sea. Now this palace was girt
round by the waters and was approached by a causeway twenty
cubits wide. It had windows on all sides commanding an ocean-view;
its floor was paved with parti-coloured marbles and its
ceiling was painted in the richest pigments and figured with gold
and lapis-lazuli. They furnished it for Kamar al-Zaman with
splendid upholstery, embroidered rugs and carpets of the richest
silk; and they clothed the walls with choice brocades and hung
curtains bespangled with gems of price. In the midst they set
him a couch of juniper<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1513" id="noteref-1513" epub:type="noteref">1513</a>-wood inlaid with pearls and jewels, and
Kamar al-Zaman sat down thereon, but the excess of his concern
and passion for the young lady had wasted his charms and emaciated
his body; he could neither eat nor drink nor sleep; and he
was like a man who had been sick twenty years of sore sickness.
His father seated himself at his head, grieving for him with the
deepest grief, and every Monday and Thursday he gave his Wazirs
and Emirs and Chamberlains and Viceroys and Lords of the realm
and levies and the rest of his lieges leave to come up to him in
that pavilion. So they entered and did their several service and
duties and abode with him till the end of the day, when they went
their ways and the King returned to his son in the pavilion whom
he left not night nor day; and he ceased not doing on this wise
for many days and nights. Such was the case with Kamar
al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman; but as regards Princess
Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seven
Palaces, when the two Jinns bore her up and laid her on her bed,
she slept till daybreak, when she awoke and sitting upright
looked right and left, but saw not the youth who had lain in her
bosom. At this her vitals fluttered, her reason fled and she
shrieked a loud shriek which awoke all her slave-girls and nurses
and duennas. They flocked in to her; and the chief of them
came forward and asked, "What aileth thee, O my lady?"
Answered the Princess, "O wretched old woman, where is my
beloved, the handsome youth who lay last night in my bosom?
Tell me whither he is gone." Now when the duenna heard this,
the light starkened in her sight and she feared from her mischief
with sore affright, and said to her, "O my Lady Budur, what
unseemly words are these?" Cried the Princess, "Woe to thee,
pestilent crone that thou art! I ask thee again where is my
beloved, the goodly youth with the shining face and the slender
form, the jetty eyes and the joined eyebrows, who lay with me
last night from supper-tide until near daybreak?" She rejoined,
"By Allah, O my lady, I have seen no young man nor any other.
I conjure thee, carry not this unseemly jest too far lest we all lose
our lives; for perhaps the joke may come to thy father's ears and
who shall then deliver us from his hand?"——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Ninety-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, "It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the duenna
bespake the Lady Budur in these words, 'Allah upon thee, O my
lady! carry not this unseemly jest too far; for perhaps it may come
to thy father's ears, and who shall then deliver us from his hand?'"
The Princess rejoined, "In very sooth a youth lay with me last
night, one of the fairest-faced of men." Exclaimed the duenna,
"Heaven preserve thy reason! indeed no one lay with thee last
night." Thereupon the Princess looked at her hand and, finding
Kamar al-Zaman's seal-ring on her finger in stead of her own, said
to her, "Woe to thee, thou accursed! thou <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traitress</span>! wilt thou lie
to me and tell me that none lay with me last night and swear to
me a falsehood in the name of the Lord?" Replied the duenna,
"By Allah, I do not lie to thee nor have I sworn falsely." Then
the Princess was incensed by her words and, drawing a sword she
had by her, she smote the old woman with it and slew her;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1514" id="noteref-1514" epub:type="noteref">1514</a>
whereupon the eunuch and the waiting-women and the concubines
cried out at her, and ran to her father and, without stay or delay,
acquainted him with her case. So the King went to her, and asked
her, "O my daughter, what aileth thee?"; and she answered,
"O my father, where is the youth who lay with me last night?"
Then her reason fled from her head and she cast her eyes right
and left and rent her raiment even to the skirt. When her sire
saw this, he bade the women lay hands on her; so they seized
her and manacled her, then putting a chain of iron about her
neck, made her fast to one of the palace-windows and there left
her.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1515" id="noteref-1515" epub:type="noteref">1515</a> Thus far concerning Princess Budur; but as regards her
father, King Ghayur, the world was straitened upon him when he
saw what had befallen his daughter, for that he loved her and her
case was not a little grievous to him. So he summoned on it the
doctors and astrologers and men skilled in talisman-writing and
said to them, "Whoso healeth my daughter of what ill she hath,
I will marry him to her and give him half of my kingdom; but
whoso cometh to her and cureth her not, I will strike off his head
and hang it over her palace-gate." Accordingly, all who went in to
her, but failed to heal her, he beheaded and hung their heads over
the palace-gates, till he had beheaded on her account forty doctors
and crucified forty astrologers; wherefor the general held aloof
from her, all the physicians having failed to medicine her malady;
and her case was a puzzle to the men of science and the adepts in
cabalistic characters. And as her longing and passion redoubled
and love and distraction were sore upon her, she poured forth
tears and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My fondness, O my moon, for thee my foeman is, ✿ And to thy comradeship the nights my thought compel:</div>
      <div class="line">In gloom I bide with fire that flames below my ribs, ✿ Whose lowe I make comparison with heat of Hell:</div>
      <div class="line">I'm plagued with sorest stress of pine and ecstasy; ✿ Nor clearest noontide can that horrid pain dispel.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she sighed and repeated these also:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Salams fro' me to friends in every stead; ✿ Indeed to all dear friends do I incline:</div>
      <div class="line">Salams, but not salams that bid adieu; ✿ Salams that growth of good for you design:</div>
      <div class="line">I love you dear, indeed, nor less your land, ✿ But bide I far from every need of mine!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when the lady Budur ceased repeating her poetry, she wept
till her eyes waxed sore and her cheeks changed form and hue,
and in this condition she continued three years. Now she had a
foster-brother, by name Marzawán,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1516" id="noteref-1516" epub:type="noteref">1516</a> who was travelling in far
lands and absent from her the whole of this time. He loved her
with an exceeding love, passing the love of brothers; so when he
came back he went in to his mother and asked for his sister, the
Princess Budur. She answered him, "O my son, thy sister hath
been smitten with madness and hath passed these three years
with a chain of iron about her neck; and all the physicians and
men of science have failed of healing her." When Marzawan
heard these words he said, "I must needs go in to her; peradventure
I may discover what she hath, and be able to medicine
her;" and his mother replied, "Needs must thou visit her, but
wait till to-morrow, that I may contrive some thing to suit thy
case." Then she went a-foot to the palace of the Lady Budur and,
accosting the eunuch in charge of the gates, made him a present
and said to him, "I have a daughter, who was brought up with
thy mistress and since then I married her; and, when that befel
the Princess which befel her, she became troubled and sore concerned,
and I desire of thy favour that my daughter may go in to
her for an hour and look on her; and then return whence she came,
so shall none know of it." Quoth the eunuch, "This may not be
except by night, after the King hath visited his child and gone
away; then come thou and thy daughter." So she kissed the
eunuch's hand and, returning home, waited till the morrow at
nightfall; and when it was time she arose and sought her son
Marzawan and attired him in woman's apparel; then, taking his
hand in hers, led him towards the palace, and ceased not walking
with him till she came upon the eunuch after the Sultan had ended
his visit to the Princess. Now when the eunuch saw her, he rose
to her, and said, "Enter, but do not prolong thy stay!" So they
went in and when Marzawan beheld the Lady Budur in the aforesaid
plight, he saluted her, after his mother had doffed his woman's
garb: then he took out of their satchel books he had brought
with him; and, lighting a wax-candle, he began to recite certain
conjurations. Thereupon the Princess looked at him and recognising
him, said, "O my brother, thou hast been absent on thy
travels, and thy news have been cut off from us." He replied,
"True! but Allah hath brought me back safe and sound, I am now
minded to set out again nor hath aught delayed me but the news
I hear of thee; wherefore my heart burned for thee and I came
to thee, so haply I may free thee of thy malady." She rejoined,
"O my brother, thinkest thou it is madness aileth me?" "Yes,"
answered he, and she said, "Not so, by Allah! 'tis even as saith
the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Quoth they "Thou rav'st on him thou lov'st:" quoth I, ✿ "The sweets of love are only for th' insane!"</div>

      <div class="line">Well! yes, I'm mad: bring him who madded me ✿ And, if he cure my madness, blame restrain!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then she let Marzawan know that she was love-daft and he said,
"Tell me concerning thy tale and what befel thee: haply there
may be in my hand something which shall be a means of deliverance
for thee."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Marzawan
thus addressed Princess Budur, "Tell me concerning thy tale and
what befel thee: haply Allah may inspire me with a means of
deliverance for thee." Quoth she, "O my brother, hear my story
which is this. One night I awoke from sleep, in the last third of
the night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1517" id="noteref-1517" epub:type="noteref">1517</a> and, sitting up, saw by my side the handsomest of
youths that be, and tongue faileth to describe him, for he was as a
willow-wand or an Indian rattan-cane. So methought it was my
father who had done on this wise in order thereby to try me, for
that he had consulted me concerning wedlock, when the Kings
sought me of him to wife, and I had refused. It was this thought
withheld me from arousing him, for I feared that, if I did aught or
embraced him, he would peradventure inform my father of my
doings. But in the morning, I found on my finger his seal-ring, in
place of my own which he had taken. And, O my brother, my
heart was seized with love of him at first sight; and, for the
violence of my passion and longing, I have never savoured the
taste of sleep and have no occupation save weeping alway and
repeating verses night and day. And this, O my brother, is my
story and the cause of my madness." Then she poured forth tears
and repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"Now Love hast banished all that bred delight; ✿ With that heart-nibbling fawn my joys took flight:</div>
      <div class="line">Lightest of trifles lover's blood to him ✿ Who wastes the vitals of the hapless wight!</div>
      <div class="line">For him I'm jealous of my sight and thought; ✿ My heart acts spy upon my thought and sight:</div>
      <div class="line">Those long-lashed eyelids rain on me their shafts ✿ Guileful, destroying hearts where'er they light:</div>
      <div class="line">Now, while my portion in the world endures, ✿ Shall I behold him ere I quit world-site?</div>
      <div class="line">What bear I for his sake I'd hide, but tears ✿ Betray my feelings to the spy's despight.</div>
      <div class="line">When near, our union seemeth ever far; ✿ When far, my thoughts to him aye nearest are."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And presently she continued, "See then, O my brother, how thou
mayest aid me in mine affliction." So Marzawan bowed his head
groundwards awhile, wondering and not knowing what to do,
then he raised it and said to her, "All thou hast spoken to me I
hold to be true, though the case of the young man pass my understanding:
but I will go round about all lands and will seek for
what may heal thee; haply Allah shall appoint thy healing to be
at my hand. Meanwhile, take patience and be not disquieted."
Thereupon Marzawan farewelled her, praying that she might be
constant and left her repeating these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Thine image ever companies my sprite, ✿ For all thou'rt distant from then pilgrim's sight;</div>
      <div class="line">But my heart-wishes e'er attract thee near: ✿ What is the lightning's speed to Thought's swift flight?</div>
      <div class="line">Then go not thou, my very light of eyes ✿ Which, when thou'rt gone, lack all the Kohl of light.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Marzawan returned to his mother's house, where he passed
the night. And when the morrow dawned, having equipped himself
for his journey, he fared forth and ceased not faring from city
to city and from island to island for a whole month, till he came to
a town named Al-Tayrab.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1518" id="noteref-1518" epub:type="noteref">1518</a> Here he went about scenting news of
the townsfolk, so haply he might light on a cure for the Princess's
malady, for in every capital he entered or passed by, it was reported
that Queen Budur, daughter of King Ghayur, had lost her wits.
But arriving at Al-Tayrab city, he heard that Kamar al-Zaman,
son of King Shahriman, was fallen sick and afflicted with melancholy
madness. So Marzawan asked the name of the Prince's
capital and they said to him, "It is on the Islands of Khalidan
and it lieth distant from our city a whole month's journey by sea,
but by land it is six months' march." So he went down to the sea
in a ship which was bound for the Khalidan Isles, and she sailed
with a favouring breeze for a whole month, till they came in sight
of the capital; and there remained for them but to make the land
when, behold, there came out on them a tempestuous wind which
carried away the masts and rent the canvas, so that the sails fell
into the sea and the ship capsized, with all on board,——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
ship capsized with all on board, each sought his own safety; and
as for Marzawan the set of the sea carried him under the King's
palace, wherein was Kamar al-Zaman. And by the decree of
destiny it so happened that this was the day on which King
Shahriman gave audience to his Grandees and high officers, and
he was sitting, with his son's head on his lap, whilst an eunuch
fanned away the flies; and the Prince had not spoken neither
had he eaten nor drunk for two days, and he was grown thinner
than a spindle.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1519" id="noteref-1519" epub:type="noteref">1519</a> Now the Wazir was standing respectfully a-foot
near the latticed window giving on the sea and, raising his eyes,
saw Marzawan being beaten by the billows and at his last gasp;
whereupon his heart was moved to pity for him, so he drew near
to the King and moving his head towards him said, "I crave thy
leave, O King, to go down to the court of the pavilion and open
the water-gate that I may rescue a man who is at the point of
drowning in the sea and bring him forth of danger into deliverance;
peradventure, on this account Allah may free thy son from
what he hath!" The King replied, "O thou Wazir, enough is
that which hath befallen my son through thee and on thine
account. Haply, if thou rescue this drowning man, he will come
to know our affairs, and look on my son who is in this state and
exult over me; but I swear by Allah, that if this half-drowned
wretch come hither and learn our condition and look upon my
son and then fare forth and speak of our secrets to any, I will
assuredly strike off thy head before his; for thou, O my Minister,
art the cause of all that hath betided us, first and last. Now do
as thou wilt." Thereupon the Wazir sprang up and, opening
the private postern which gave upon the sea, descended to the
causeway; then walked on twenty steps and came to the water
where he saw Marzawan nigh unto death. So he put out his
hand to him and, catching him by his hair, drew him ashore in
a state of insensibility, with belly full of water and eyes half out
of his head. The Wazir waited till he came to himself, when he
pulled off his wet clothes and clad him in a fresh suit, covering
his head with one of his servants' turbands; after which he said
to him, "Know that I have been the means of saving thee from
drowning: do not thou requite me by causing my death and thine
own."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Wazir did to Marzawan what he did, he thus addressed him,
"Know that I have been the cause of saving thee from drowning,
so requite me not by causing my death and thine own." Asked
Marzawan, "And how so?"; and the Wazir answered, "Thou art
at this hour about to go up and pass among Emirs and Wazirs,
all of them silent and none speaking, because of Kamar al-Zaman,
the son of the Sultan." Now when Marzawan heard the name of
Kamar al-Zaman, he knew that this was he whom he had heard
spoken of in sundry cities and of whom he came in search, but
he feigned ignorance and asked the Wazir, "And who is Kamar
al-Zaman?" Answered the Minister, "He is the son of Sultan
Shahriman and he is sore sick and lieth strown on his couch restless
alway, eating not nor drinking neither sleeping night or day;
indeed he is nigh upon death and we have lost hope of his living
and are certain that he is dying. Beware lest thou look too long
on him, or thou look on any place other than that where thou
settest thy feet: else thou art a lost man, and I also." He replied,
"Allah upon thee, O Wazir, I implore thee, of thy favour, acquaint
me touching this youth thou describest, what is the cause of the
condition in which he is." The Wazir replied, "I know none,
save that, three years ago, his father required him to wed, but he
refused; whereat the King was wroth and imprisoned him. And
when he awoke on the morrow, he fancied that during the night
he had been roused from sleep and had seen by his side a young
lady of passing loveliness, whose charms tongue can never express;
and he assured us that he had plucked off her seal-ring from her
finger and had put it on his own and that she had done likewise;
but we know not the secret of all this business. So by Allah, O
my son, when thou comest up with me into the palace, look not
on the Prince, but go thy way; for the Sultan's heart is full of
wrath against me." So said Marzawan to himself, "By Allah;
this is the one I sought!" Then he followed the Wazir up to the
palace, where the Minister seated himself at the Prince's feet; but
Marzawan found forsooth nothing to do but go up to Kamar al-Zaman
and stand before him at gaze. Upon this the Wazir died
of affright in his skin, and kept looking at Marzawan and signalling
him to wend his way; but he feigned not to see him and gave
not over gazing upon Kamar al-Zaman, till he was well assured
that it was indeed he whom he was seeking,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

made his shape even as her shape and his complexion as her

<p>When Marzawan recited this ode, the words fell upon Kamar
al-Zaman's heart as freshness after fever and returning health;
and he sighed and, turning his tongue in his mouth, said to his

Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman said to his sire, "O my father, allow this youth to come
and sit by my side." Now when the King heard these words
from his son, he rejoiced with exceeding joy, though at the first
his heart had been set against Marzawan and he had determined
that the stranger's head needs must be stricken off: but when he
heard Kamar al-Zaman speak, his anger left him and he arose and
drawing Marzawan to him, seated him by his son and turning to
him said, "Praised be Allah for thy safety!" He replied, "Allah
preserve thee! and preserve thy son to thee!" and called down
blessings on the King. Then the King asked, "From what
country art thou?"; and he answered, "From the Islands of the
Inland Sea, the kingdom of King Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and
the Seas and the Seven Palaces." Quoth King Shahriman,
"Maybe thy coming shall be blessed to my son and Allah vouchsafe
to heal what is in him." Quoth Marzawan, "Inshallah,
naught shall be save what shall be well!" Then turning to Kamar
al-Zaman, he said to him in his ear unheard of the King and his
court, "O my lord! be of good cheer, and hearten thy heart and
let thine eyes be cool and clear and, with respect to her for whose
sake thou art thus, ask not of her case on thine account. But
thou keptest thy secret and fellest sick, while she told her secret
and they said she had gone mad; so she is now in prison, with an
iron chain about her neck, in most piteous plight; but, Allah
willing, the healing of both of you shall come from my hand."
Now when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, his life returned to
him and he took heart and felt a thrill of joy and signed to his
father to help him sit up; and the King was like to fly for gladness
and rose hastily and lifted him up. Presently, of his fear for
his son, he shook the kerchief of dismissal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1526" id="noteref-1526" epub:type="noteref">1526</a>; and all the Emirs and
Wazirs withdrew; then he set two pillows for his son to lean upon,
after which he bade them perfume the palace with saffron and
decorate the city, saying to Marzawan, "By Allah, O my son, of a
truth thine aspect be a lucky and a blessed!" And he made as
much of him as he might and called for food, and when they
brought it, Marzawan came up to the Prince and said, "Rise, eat
with me." So he obeyed him and ate with him, and all the while
the King invoked blessings on Marzawan and said, "How auspicious
is thy coming, O my son!" And when the father saw his boy eat,
his joy and gladness redoubled, and he went out and told the
Prince's mother and all the household. Then he spread throughout
the palace the good news of the Prince's recovery and the
King commanded the decoration of the city and it was a day
of high festival. Marzawan passed that night with Kamar al-Zaman,
and the King also slept with them in joy and delight
for his son's recovery.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of

also passed that night with them in the excess of his joy for
his son's recovery. And when the next morning dawned, and the
King had gone away and the two young men were left alone,
Kamar al-Zaman told his story from beginning to end to Marzawan
who said, "In very sooth I know her with whom thou didst
foregather; her name is the Princess Budur and she is daughter to
King Ghayur." Then he related to him all that had passed with
the Princess from first to last and acquainted him with the excessive
love she bore him, saying, "All that befel thee with thy father
hath befallen her with hers, and thou art without doubt her beloved,
even as she is thine; so brace up thy resolution and take
heart, for I will bring thee to her and unite you both anon and
deal with you even as saith the poet:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And he ceased not to comfort and solace and encourage Kamar
al-Zaman and urge him to eat and drink till he ate food and drank
wine, and life returned to him and he was saved from his ill case;
and Marzawan cheered him and diverted him with talk and songs
and stories, and in good time he became free of his disorder and
stood up and sought to go to the Hammam.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1528" id="noteref-1528" epub:type="noteref">1528</a> So Marzawan took
him by the hand and both went to the bath, where they washed

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar
al-Zaman, son of King Shahriman, went to the Hammam, his
father in his joy at this event freed the prisoners, and presented
splendid dresses to his grandees and bestowed large alm-gifts
upon the poor and bade decorate the city seven days. Then
quoth Marzawan to Kamar al-Zaman, "Know, O my lord, that
I came not from the Lady Budur save for this purpose, and the
object of my journey was to deliver her from her present case;
and it remaineth for us only to devise how we may get to her,
since thy father cannot brook the thought of parting from thee.
So it is my counsel that to-morrow thou ask his leave to go abroad
hunting. Then do thou take with thee a pair of saddle-bags full
of money and mount a swift steed, and lead a spare horse, and
I will do the like, and say to thy sire:—I have a mind to divert
myself with hunting the desert and to see the open country and
there to pass one night. Suffer not any servant to follow us, for
as soon as we reach the open country, we will go our ways."
Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced in this plan with great joy and cried,
"It is good." Then he stiffened his back and, going in to his
father, sought his leave and spoke as he had been taught, and the
King consented to his going forth a-hunting and said, "O my son,
blessed be the day that restoreth thee to health! I will not gainsay
thee in this; but pass not more than one night in the desert
and return to me on the morrow; for thou knowest that life is not
good to me without thee, and indeed I can hardly believe thee to
be wholly recovered from what thou hadst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1529" id="noteref-1529" epub:type="noteref">1529</a> because thou art to me

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then the King equipped his son Kamar al-Zaman and Marzawan
for the excursion, bidding make ready for them four horses, together
with a dromedary to carry the money and a camel to bear
the water and belly-timber; and Kamar al-Zaman forbade any
of his attendants to follow him. His father farewelled him and
pressed him to his breast and kissed him, saying, "I ask thee in
the name of Allah, be not absent from me more than one night,
wherein sleep will be unlawful to me, for I am even as saith the
poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">

      <div class="line">Does love-lowe burn thy heart as burns it mine, ✿ Doomed night and day Gehenna-fire to smell?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Answered Kamar al-Zaman, "O my father, Inshallah, I will lie
abroad but one night!" Then he took leave of him, and he and
Marzawan mounted and leading the spare horses, the dromedary
with the money and the camel with the water and victual, turned
their faces towards the open country;——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawning day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and First Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman
and Marzawan fared forth and turned their faces towards
the open country; and they travelled from the first of the day till
nightfall, when they halted and ate and drank and fed their beasts
and rested awhile; after which they again took horse and ceased
not journeying for three days, and on the fourth they came to a
spacious tract wherein was a thicket. They alighted in it and
Marzawan, taking the camel and one of the horses, slaughtered
them and cut off their flesh and stripped their bones. Then he
doffed from Kamar al-Zaman his shirt and trousers which he
smeared with the horse's blood and he took the Prince's coat
which he tore to shreds and befouled with gore; and he cast them
down in the fork of the road. Then they ate and drank and
mounting set forward again; and, when Kamar al-Zaman asked
why this was done, and said, "What is this O my brother, and
how shall it profit us?"; Marzawan replied, "Know that thy
father, when we have outstayed the second night after the night
for which we had his leave, and yet we return not, will mount and
follow in our track till he come hither; and, when he happeneth
upon this blood which I have spilt and he seeth thy shirt and
trousers rent and gore-fouled, he will fancy that some accident
befel thee from bandits or wild-beasts; so he will give up hope of
thee and return to his city, and by this device we shall win our
wishes." Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, "By Allah, this be indeed a
rare device! Thou hast done right well."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1531" id="noteref-1531" epub:type="noteref">1531</a> Then the two fared
on days and nights and all that while Kamar al-Zaman did
naught but complain when he found himself alone, and he ceased
not weeping till they drew near their journey's end, when he
rejoiced and repeated these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Wilt tyrant play with truest friend who thinks of thee each hour, ✿ And after showing love-desire betray indifference?</div>
      <div class="line">May I forfeit every favour if in love I falsed thee, ✿ If thee I left, abandon me by way of recompense:</div>
      <div class="line">But I've been guilty of no crime such harshness to deserve, ✿ And if I aught offended thee I bring my penitence;</div>
      <div class="line">Of Fortune's wonders one it is thou hast abandoned me; ✿ But Fortune never wearieth of showing wonderments.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When he had made an end of his verses, Marzawan said to him,
"Look! these be King Ghayur's Islands;" whereat Kamar
al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for what
he had done, and kissed him between the eyes and strained him——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Marzawan said "Look! these be the Islands of King Ghayur;"
Kamar al-Zaman joyed with exceeding joy and thanked him for
what he had done and kissed him between the eyes and strained
him to his bosom. And after reaching the Islands and entering
the city they took up their lodging in a khan, where they rested
three days from the fatigues of their wayfare; after which Marzawan
carried Kamar al-Zaman to the bath and, clothing him in
merchant's gear, provided him with a geomantic tablet of gold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1532" id="noteref-1532" epub:type="noteref">1532</a>
with a set of astrological instruments and with an astrolabe of
silver, plated with gold. Then he said to him, "Arise, O my lord,
and take thy stand under the walls of the King's palace and cry
out:—I am the ready Reckoner; I am the Scrivener; I am he
who weeteth the Sought and the Seeker; I am the finished man
of Science; I am the Astrologer accomplished in experience!
Where then is he that seeketh? As soon as the King heareth
this, he will send after thee and carry thee in to his daughter the
Princess Budur, thy lover; but when about going in to her do
thou say to him:—Grant me three days' delay, and if she recover,
give her to me to wife; and if not, deal with me as thou dealtest
with those who forewent me. He will assuredly agree to this, so as
soon as thou art alone with her, discover thyself to her; and when
she seeth thee, she will recover strength and her madness will cease
from her and she will be made whole in one night. Then do thou
give her to eat and drink, and her father, rejoicing in her recovery,
will marry thee to her and share his kingdom with thee; for he hath
imposed on himself this condition and so peace be upon thee." Now
when Kamar al-Zaman heard these words he exclaimed, "May I
never lack thy benefits!", and, taking the set of instruments aforesaid,
sallied forth from the caravanserai in the dress of his order.
He walked on till he stood under the walls of King Ghayur's palace,
where he began to cry out, saying, "I am the Scribe, I am the
ready Reckoner, I am he who knoweth the Sought and the Seeker;
I am he who openeth the Volume and summeth up the Sums;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1533" id="noteref-1533" epub:type="noteref">1533</a>
who Dreams can expound whereby the sought is found! Where
then is the seeker?" Now when the city people heard this, they
flocked to him, for it was long since they had seen Scribe or
Astrologer, and they stood round him and, looking upon him,
they saw one in the prime of beauty and grace and perfect
elegance, and they marvelled at his loveliness, and his fine stature
and symmetry. Presently one of them accosted him and said,
"Allah upon thee, O thou fair and young, with the eloquent tongue!
incur not this affray; nor throw thy life away in thine ambition
to marry the Princess Budur. Only cast thine eyes upon yonder
heads hung up; all their owners have lost their lives in this same
venture." Yet Kamar al-Zaman paid no heed to them, but cried
out at the top of his voice, saying, "I am the Doctor, the
Scrivener! I am the Astrologer, the Calculator!" And all the
townsfolk forbade him from this, but he regarded them not at
all, saying in his mind, "None knoweth desire save whoso suffereth
it." Then he began again to cry his loudest, shouting, "I am the
Scrivener, I am the Astrologer!"——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman in no wise heeded the words of the citizens, but continued
to cry out, "I am the Calculator! I am the Astrologer!"
Thereupon all the townsfolk were wroth with him and said to him,
"Thou art nothing but an imbecile, silly, self-willed lad! Have
pity on thine own youth and tender years and beauty and loveliness."
But he cried all the more, "I am the Astrologer, I am the
Calculator! Is there any one that seeketh?" As he was thus
crying and the people forbidding him, behold, King Ghayur heard
his voice and the clamour of the lieges and said to his Wazir, "Go
down and bring me yon Astrologer." So the Wazir went down in
haste, and taking Kamar al-Zaman from the midst of the crowd
led him up to the King; and when in the presence he kissed the
ground and began versifying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Eight glories meet, all, all conjoined in thee, ✿ Whereby may Fortune aye thy servant be:</div>
      <div class="line">Lere, lordliness, grace, generosity; ✿ Plain words, deep meaning, honour, victory!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When the King looked upon him, he seated him by his side and
said to him, "By Allah, O my son, an thou be not an astrologer,
venture not thy life nor comply with my condition; for I have
bound myself that whoso goeth in to my daughter and healeth her
not of that which hath befallen her I will strike off his head; but
whoso healeth her him I will marry to her. So let not thy beauty
and loveliness delude thee: for, by Allah! and again, by Allah! if
thou cure her not, I will assuredly cut off thy head." And Kamar
al-Zaman replied, "This is thy right; and I consent, for I wot of
this ere came I hither." Then King Ghayur took the Kazis to
witness against him and delivered him to the eunuch, saying,
"Carry this one to the Lady Budur." So the eunuch took him by
the hand and led him along the passage; but Kamar al-Zaman
outstripped him and pushed on before, whilst the eunuch ran after
him, saying, "Woe to thee! Hasten not to thine own ruin: never
yet saw I astrologer so eager for his proper destruction; but thou
weetest not what calamities are before thee." Thereupon Kamar
al-Zaman turned away his face from the eunuch——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
eunuch thus addressed Kamar al-Zaman, "Patience, and no indecent
hurry!"; the Prince turned away his face and began repeating
these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A Sage, I feel a fool before thy charms; ✿ Distraught, I wot not what the words I say:</div>
      <div class="line">If say I "Sun," away thou dost not pass ✿ From eyes of me, while suns go down with day:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou hast completed Beauty, in whose praise ✿ Speech-makers fail, and talkers lose their way.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then the eunuch stationed Kamar al-Zaman behind the curtain of
the Princess's door and the Prince said to him, "Which of the two
ways will please thee more; treat and cure thy lady from here or
go in and heal her within the curtain?" The eunuch marvelled
at his words and answered, "An thou heal her from here it were
better proof of thy skill." Upon this Kamar al-Zaman sat down
behind the curtain and, taking out ink-case, pen and paper, wrote
the following: "This is the writ of one whom passion swayeth. ✿
and whom longing waylayeth ✿ and wakeful misery slayeth ✿ one
who despaireth of living ✿ and looketh for naught but dying ✿
with whose mourning heart ✿ nor comforter nor helper taketh part
✿ One whose sleepless eyes ✿ none succoureth from anxieties ✿
whose day is passed in fire ✿ and his night in torturing desire ✿
whose body is wasted for much emaciation ✿ and no messenger
from his beloved bringeth him consolation." And after this he
indited the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I write with heart devoted to thy thought, ✿ And eyelids chafed by tears of blood they bled;</div>
      <div class="line">And body clad, by loving pine and pain, ✿ In shirt of leanness, and worn down to thread,</div>
      <div class="line">To thee complain I of Love's tormentry, ✿ Which ousted hapless Patience from her stead:</div>
      <div class="line"><i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A toi!</span></i> show favour and some mercy deign, ✿ For Passion's cruel hands my vitals shred.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And beneath his lines he wrote these cadenced sentences, "The
heart's pain is removed ✿ by union with the beloved ✿ and
whomso his lover paineth ✿ only Allah <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">assaineth!</span> ✿ If we or you
have wrought deceit ✿ may the deceiver win defeat! ✿ There is
naught goodlier than a lover who keeps faith ✿ with the beloved
who works him scathe." Then, by way of subscription, he wrote,
"From the distracted and despairing man ✿ whom love and longing
trepan ✿ from the lover under passion's ban ✿ the prisoner of
transport and distraction ✿ from this Kamar al-Zaman ✿ son of
Shahriman ✿ to the peerless one ✿ of the fair Houris the pearl-union
✿ to the Lady Budur ✿ daughter of King Al-Ghayur ✿
Know thou that by night I am sleepless ✿ and by day in distress
✿ consumed with increasing wasting and pain ✿ and longing
and love unfain ✿ abounding in sighs ✿ with tear-flooded eyes ✿
by passion captive ta'en ✿ of Desire the slain ✿ with heart seared
by the parting of us twain ✿ the debtor of longing-bane, of sickness
cup-companion ✿ I am the sleepless one, who never closeth
eye ✿ the slave of love, whose tears run never dry ✿ for the fire
of my heart is still burning ✿ and never hidden is the flame of my
yearning." Then on the margin Kamar al-Zaman wrote this
admired verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Salam from graces hoarded by my Lord ✿ To her, who holds my heart and soul in hoard!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And also these:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Pray'ee grant me some words from your lips, belike ✿ Such mercy may comfort and cool these eyne:</div>
      <div class="line">From the stress of my love and my pine for you, ✿ I make light of what makes me despised, indign:</div>
      <div class="line">Allah guard a folk whose abode was far, ✿ And whose secret I kept in the holiest shrine:</div>
      <div class="line">Now Fortune in kindness hath favoured me ✿ Thrown on threshold dust of this love o' mine:</div>
      <div class="line">By me bedded I looked on Budúr, whose sun ✿ The moon of my fortunes hath made to shine.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, having affixed his seal-ring to the missive, he wrote these
couplets in the place of address:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ask of my writ what wrote my pen in dole, ✿ And hear my tale of misery from this scroll;</div>
      <div class="line">My hand is writing while my tears down flow, ✿ And to the paper 'plains my longing soul:</div>
      <div class="line">My tears cease not to roll upon this sheet, ✿ And if they stopped I'd cause blood-gouts to roll.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And at the end he added this other verse:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I've sent the ring from off thy finger bore ✿ I when we met, now deign my ring restore!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Kamar al-Zaman set the Lady Budur's ring inside the letter
and sealed it and gave it to the eunuch, who took it and went
in with it to his mistress.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman,
after setting the seal-ring inside the epistle, gave it to the
eunuch who took it and went in with it to his mistress; and, when
the Lady Budur opened it, she found therein her own very ring.
Then she read the paper and when she understood its purport and
knew that it was from her beloved, and that he in person stood
behind the curtain, her reason began to fly and her breast swelled
for joy and rose high; and she repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Long, long have I bewailed the sev'rance of our loves, ✿ With tears that from my lids streamed down like burning rain;</div>
      <div class="line">And vowed that, if the days deign reunite us two, ✿ My lips should never speak of severance again:</div>
      <div class="line">Joy hath o'erwhelmed me so that, for the very stress ✿ Of that which gladdens me to weeping I am fain.</div>
      <div class="line">Tears are become to you a habit, O my eyes, ✿ So that ye weep as well for gladness as for pain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1534" id="noteref-1534" epub:type="noteref">1534</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And having finished her verse, the Lady Budur stood up forthwith
and, firmly setting her feet to the wall, strained with all her might
upon the collar of iron, till she brake it from her neck and snapped
the chains. Then going forth from behind the curtain she threw
herself on Kamar al-Zaman and kissed him on the mouth, like a
pigeon feeding its young.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1535" id="noteref-1535" epub:type="noteref">1535</a> And she embraced him with all the
stress of her love and longing and said to him, "O my lord, do
I wake or sleep and hath the Almighty indeed vouchsafed us
reunion after disunion? Laud be to Allah who hath our loves
repaired, even after we despaired!" Now when the eunuch saw
her in this case, he went off running to King Ghayur and, kissing
the ground before him, said, "O my lord, know that this Astrologer
is indeed the Shaykh of all astrologers, who are fools to him, all of
them; for verily he hath cured thy daughter while standing behind
the curtain and without going in to her." Quoth the King, "Look
well to it, is this news true?" Answered the Eunuch, "O my lord,
rise and come and see for thyself how she hath found strength to
break the iron chains and is come forth to the Astrologer, kissing
and embracing him." Thereupon the King arose and went in to
his daughter who, when she saw him, stood up in haste and
covered her head,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1536" id="noteref-1536" epub:type="noteref">1536</a> and recited these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">The tooth-stick love I not; for when I say, ✿ "Siwák,"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1537" id="noteref-1537" epub:type="noteref">1537</a> I miss thee, for it sounds "Siwá-ka":</div>
      <div class="line">The caper-tree I love; for when I say, ✿ "Arák"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1538" id="noteref-1538" epub:type="noteref">1538</a> it sounds I look on thee, "Ará-ka."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon the King was so transported for joy at her recovery
that he felt like to fly and kissed her between the eyes, for he
loved her with dearest love; then, turning to Kamar al-Zaman,
he asked him who he was, and said, "What countryman art
thou?" So the Prince told him his name and rank, and informed
him that he was the son of King Shahriman, and presently
related to him the whole story from beginning to end;
and acquainted him with what happened between himself and
the Lady Budur; and how he had taken her seal-ring from her
finger and had placed it on his own; whereat Ghayur marvelled
and said, "Verily your story deserveth in books to be chronicled,
and when you are dead and gone age after age be read." Then
he summoned Kazis and witnesses forthright and married the
Lady Budur to Prince Kamar al-Zaman; after which he bade
decorate the city seven days long. So they spread the tables
with all manner of meats, whilst the drums beat and the criers
announced the glad tidings, and all the troops donned their richest
clothes; and they illuminated the city and held high festival.
Then Kamar al-Zaman went in to the Lady Budur and the King
rejoiced in her recovery and in her marriage; and praised Allah
for that He had made her to fall in love with a goodly youth of
the sons of Kings. So they unveiled her and displayed the bride
before the bridegroom; and both were the living likeness of each
other in beauty and comeliness and grace and love-allurement.
Then Kamar al-Zaman lay with her that night and took his will
of her, whilst she in like manner fulfilled her desire of him and
enjoyed his charms and grace; and they slept in each other's arms
till the morning. On the morrow, the King made a wedding-feast
to which he gathered all comers from the Islands of the Inner and
Outer Seas, and he spread the tables with choicest viands nor
ceased the banquetting for a whole month. Now when Kamar al-Zaman
had thus fulfilled his will and attained his inmost desire,
and whenas he had tarried awhile with the Princess Budur, he
bethought him of his father, King Shahriman, and saw him in a
dream, saying, "O my son, is it thus thou dealest with me?" and
reciting in the vision these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed to watch the darkness-moon he blighted me, ✿ And to star-gaze through longsome night he plighted me:</div>
      <div class="line">Easy, my heart! for haply he'll unite with thee; ✿ And patience, Sprite! with whatso ills he dight to thee.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now after seeing his father in the dream and hearing his reproaches,
Kamar al-Zaman awoke in the morning, afflicted and
troubled, whereupon the Lady Budur questioned him and he told
her what he had seen——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Kamar al-Zaman acquainted the Lady Budur with what he had
seen in his dream, she and he went in to her sire and, telling him
what had passed, besought his leave to travel. He gave the Prince
the permission he sought; but the Princess said, "O my father, I
cannot bear to be parted from him." Quoth Ghayur, her sire,
"Then go thou with him," and gave her leave to be absent a
whole twelvemonth and afterwards to visit him in every year once;
so she kissed his hand and Kamar al-Zaman did the like. Thereupon
King Ghayur proceeded to equip his daughter and her
bridegroom for the journey, and furnished them with outfit and
appointments for the march; and brought out of his stables
horses marked with his own brand, blood-dromedaries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1539" id="noteref-1539" epub:type="noteref">1539</a> which can
journey ten days without water, and prepared a litter for his
daughter, besides loading mules and camels with victual; moreover,
he gave them slaves and eunuchs to serve them and all
manner of travelling gear; and on the day of departure, when
King Ghayur took leave of Kamar al-Zaman, he bestowed on him
ten splendid suits of cloth of gold embroidered with stones of
price, together with ten riding horses and ten she-camels, and a
treasury of money;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1540" id="noteref-1540" epub:type="noteref">1540</a> and he charged him to love and cherish his
daughter the Lady Budur. Then the King accompanied them to
the farthest limits of his Islands where, going in to his daughter
Budur in the litter, he kissed her and strained her to his bosom,
weeping and repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O thou who wooest Severance, easy fare! ✿ For love-embrace belongs to lover-friend:</div>
      <div class="line">Fare softly! Fortune's nature falsehood is, ✿ And parting shall love's every meeting end.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then leaving his daughter, he went to her husband and bade him
farewell and kissed him; after which he parted from them and,
giving the order for the march he returned to his capital with his
troops. The Prince and Princess and their suite fared on without
stopping through the first day and the second and the third and
the fourth; nor did they cease faring for a whole month till they
came to a spacious champaign, abounding in pasturage, where they
pitched their tents; and they ate and drank and rested, and the
Princess Budur lay down to sleep. Presently, Kamar al-Zaman
went in to her and found her lying asleep clad in a shift of apricot-coloured
silk that showed all and everything; and on her head was
a coif of gold-cloth embroidered with pearls and jewels. The breeze
raised her shift which laid bare her navel and showed her breasts
and displayed a stomach whiter than snow, each one of whose
dimples would contain an ounce of benzoin-oinment.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1541" id="noteref-1541" epub:type="noteref">1541</a> At this
sight, his love and longing redoubled, and he began reciting:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">An were it asked me when by hell-fire burnt, ✿ When flames of heart my vitals hold and hem,</div>
      <div class="line">"Which wouldst thou chose, say wouldst thou rather them, ✿ Or drink sweet cooling draught?" I'd answer, "Them!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he put his hand to the band of her petticoat-trousers and
drew it and loosed it, for his soul lusted after her, when he saw a
jewel, red as dye-wood, made fast to the band. He untied it and
examined it and, seeing two lines of writing graven thereon, in a
character not to be read, marvelled and said in his mind, "Were
not this bezel something to her very dear she had not bound it to
her trousers-band nor hidden it in the most privy and precious
place about her person, that she might not be parted from it.
Would I knew what she doth with this and what is the secret that
is in it." So saying, he took it and went outside the tent to look
at it in the light,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day,
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he
took the bezel to look at it in the light, the while he was holding it
behold, a bird swooped down on him and, snatching the same from
his hand, flew off with it and then lighted on the ground. Thereupon
Kamar al-Zaman fearing to lose the jewel, ran after the
bird; but it flew on before him, keeping just out of his reach,
and ceased not to draw him on from dale to dale and from hill to
hill, till the night starkened and the firmament darkened, when it
roosted on a high tree. So Kamar al-Zaman stopped under the
tree confounded in thought and faint for famine and fatigue, and
giving himself up for lost, would have turned back, but knew not
the way whereby he came, for that darkness had overtaken him.
Then he exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"; and laying him down
under the tree (whereon was the bird) slept till the morning, when
he awoke and saw the bird also wake up and fly away. He arose
and walked after it, and it flew on little by little before him, after
the measure of his faring; at which he smiled and said, "By
Allah, a strange thing! Yesterday, this bird flew before me as
fast as I could run, and to-day, knowing that I have awoke tired
and cannot run, he flieth after the measure of my faring. By
Allah, this is wonderful! But I must needs follow this bird
whether it lead me to death or to life; and I will go wherever it
goeth, for at all events it will not abide save in some inhabited
land."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1542" id="noteref-1542" epub:type="noteref">1542</a> So he continued to follow the bird which roosted every
night upon a tree; and he ceased not pursuing it for a space of
ten days, feeding on the fruits of the earth and drinking of its
waters. At the end of this time, he came in sight of an inhabited
city, whereupon the bird darted off like the glance of the eye and,
entering the town, disappeared from Kamar al-Zaman, who knew
not what it meant or whither it was gone; so he marvelled at this
and exclaimed, "Praise be to Allah who hath brought me in safety
to this city!" Then he sat down by a stream and washed his
hands and feet and face and rested awhile; and, recalling his late
easy and pleasant life of union with his beloved and contrasting
it with his present plight of trouble and fatigue and distress and
strangerhood and famine and severance, the tears streamed from
his eyes and he began repeating these <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cinquains</span>:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">

</div>

<p>And as soon as he had finished his poetry and had taken his rest,
he rose and walked on little by little, till he entered the city——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as
Kamar al-Zaman had finished his poetry and had taken his rest,
he arose and entered the city-gate<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1544" id="noteref-1544" epub:type="noteref">1544</a> not knowing whither he should
wend. He crossed the city from end to end, entering by the land-gate,
and ceased not faring on till he came out at the sea-gate, for
the city stood on the sea-shore. Yet he met not a single one of
its citizens. And after issuing from the land-gate he fared forwards
and ceased not faring till he found himself among the
orchards and gardens of the place; and, passing among the trees
presently came to a garden and stopped before its door; whereupon
the keeper came out to him and saluted him. The Prince
returned his greeting and the gardener bade him welcome, saying,
"Praised be Allah that thou hast come off safe from the dwellers
of this city! Quick, come into the garth, ere any of the townfolk
see thee." Thereupon Kamar al-Zaman entered that garden, wondering
in mind, and asked the keeper, "What may be the history
of the people of this city and who may they be?" The other
answered, "Know that the people of this city are all Magians:
but Allah upon thee, tell me how thou camest to this city and
what caused thy coming to our capital." Accordingly Kamar al-Zaman
told the gardener all that had befallen him from beginning
to end, whereat he marvelled with great marvel and said, "Know,
O my son, that the cities of Al-Islam lie far from us; and between
us and them is a four months' voyage by sea and a whole twelve
months' journey by land. We have a ship which saileth every year
with merchandise to the nearest Moslem country and which entereth
the seas of the Ebony Islands and thence maketh the Khalidan
Islands, the dominions of King Shahriman." Thereupon
Kamar al-Zaman considered awhile and concluded that he could
not do better than abide in the garden with the gardener and
become his assistant, receiving for pay one fourth of the produce.
So he said to him, "Wilt thou take me into thy service, to help
thee in this garden?" Answered the gardener, "To hear is to
consent;" and began teaching him to lead the water to the roots
of the trees. So Kamar al-Zaman abode with him, watering the
trees and hoeing up the weeds and wearing a short blue frock
which reached to his knees. And he wept floods of tears; for he
had no rest day or night, by reason of his strangerhood and he
ceased not to repeat verses upon his beloved, amongst others the
following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Ye promised us and will ye not keep plight? ✿ Ye said a say and shall not deed be dight?</div>
      <div class="line">We wake for passion while ye slumber and sleep; ✿ Watchers and wakers claim not equal right:</div>
      <div class="line">We vowed to keep our loves in secrecy, ✿ But spake the meddler and you spoke forthright:</div>
      <div class="line">O friend in pain and pleasure, joy and grief, ✿ In all case you, you only, claim my sprite!</div>
      <div class="line">'Mid folk is one who holds my prisoned heart; ✿ Would he but show some ruth for me to sight.</div>
      <div class="line">Not every eye like mine is wounded sore, ✿ Not every heart like mine love-pinings blight:</div>
      <div class="line">Ye wronged me saying, Love is wrongous aye ✿ Yea! ye were right, events have proved that quite.</div>
      <div class="line">Forget they one love-thralled, whose faith the world ✿ Robs not, though burn the fires in heart alight:</div>
      <div class="line">If an my foeman shall become my judge, ✿ Whom shall I sue to remedy his despight?</div>
      <div class="line">Had not I need of love nor love had sought, ✿ My heart forsure were not thus love-distraught.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such was the case with Kamar al-Zaman; but as regards his wife,
the Lady Budur, when she awoke she sought her husband and
found him not: then she saw her petticoat-trousers undone, for
the band had been loosed and the bezel lost, whereupon she said
to herself, "By Allah, this is strange! Where is my husband? It
would seem as if he had taken the talisman and gone away,
knowing not the secret which is in it. Would to Heaven I knew
whither can he have wended! But it must needs have been some
extraordinary matter that drew him away, for he cannot brook to
leave me a moment. Allah curse the stone and damn its hour!"
Then she considered awhile and said in her mind, "If I go out
and tell the varlets and let them learn that my husband is lost,
they will lust after me: there is no help for it but that I use a
stratagem." So she rose and donned some of her husband's clothes
and riding-boots, and a turband like his, drawing one corner of it
across her face for a mouth-veil.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1545" id="noteref-1545" epub:type="noteref">1545</a> Then, setting a slave-girl in her
litter, she went forth from the tent and called to the pages who
brought her Kamar al-Zaman's steed; and she mounted and bade
them load the beasts and resume the march. So they bound on
the burdens and departed; and she concealed her trick, none
doubting but she was Kamar al-Zaman, for she favoured him in
face and form; nor did she cease journeying, she and her suite,
days and nights, till they came in sight of a city overlooking the
Salt Sea, where they pitched their tents without the walls and
halted to rest. The Princess asked the name of the town and
was told, "It is called the City of Ebony; its King is named
Armanús, and he hath a daughter Hayát al-Nufús<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1546" id="noteref-1546" epub:type="noteref">1546</a> hight,"——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Ninth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Lady Budur halted within sight of the Ebony City to take her
rest, King Armanus sent a messenger, to learn what King it was
who had encamped without his capital; so the messenger, coming
to the tents, made enquiry anent their King, and was told that
she was a King's son who had lost the way being bound for
the Khalidan Islands; whereupon he returned to King Armanus
with the tidings; and, when the King heard them, he straightway
rode out with the lords of his land to greet the stranger on
arrival. As he drew near the tents the Lady Budur came to
meet him on foot, whereupon the King alighted and they saluted
each other. Then he took her to the city and, bringing her up
to the palace, bade them spread the tables and trays of food and
commanded them to transport her company and baggage to the
guest-house. So they abode there three days; at the end of
which time the King came in to the Lady Budur. Now she had
that day gone to the Hammam and her face shone as the moon
at its full, a seduction to the world and a rending of the veil of
shame to mankind; and Armanus found her clad in a suit of silk,
embroidered with gold and jewels; so he said to her, "O my son,
know that I am a very old man, decrepit withal, and Allah hath
blessed me with no child save one daughter, who resembleth thee
in beauty and grace; and I am now waxed unfit for the conduct
of the state. She is thine, O my son; and, if this my land please
thee and thou be willing to abide and make thy home here, I will
marry thee to her and give thee my kingdom and so be at rest."
When Princess Budur heard this, she bowed her head and her
forehead sweated for shame, and she said to herself, "How
shall I do, and I a woman? If I refuse and depart from him, I
cannot be safe but that haply he send after me troops to slay
me; and if I consent, belike I shall be put to shame. I have
lost my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and know not what is become
of him; nor can I escape from this scrape save by holding my
peace and consenting and abiding here, till Allah bring about
what is to be." So she raised her head and made submission to
King Armanus, saying, "Hearkening and obedience!"; whereat
he rejoiced and bade the herald make proclamation throughout
the Ebony Islands to hold high festival and decorate the houses.
Then he assembled his Chamberlains and Nabobs, and Emirs
and Wazirs and his officers of state and the Kazis of the city;
and, formally abdicating his Sultanate, endowed Budur therewith
and invested her in all the vestments of royalty. The Emirs and
Grandees went in to her and did her homage, nothing doubting
but that she was a young man, and all who looked on her bepissed
their bag-trousers, for the excess of her beauty and loveliness.
Then, after the lady Budur had been made Sultan and the drums
had been beaten in announcement of the glad event, and she
had been ceremoniously enthroned, King Armanus proceeded
to equip his daughter Hayat al-Nufus for marriage, and in a
few days, they brought the Lady Budur in to her, when they
seemed as it were two moons risen at one time or two suns in
conjunction. So they entered the bridal-chamber and the doors
were shut and the curtains let down upon them, after the attendants
had lighted the wax-candles and spread for them the carpet-bed.
When Budur found herself alone with the Princess Hayat
al-Nufus, she called to mind her beloved Kamar al-Zaman and
grief was sore upon her. So she wept for his absence, and
estrangement and she began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O ye who fled and left my heart in pain low li'en, ✿ No breath of life is found within this frame of mine:</div>
      <div class="line">I have an eye which e'er complains of wake, but lo! ✿ Tears occupy it; would that wake content these eyne!</div>
      <div class="line">After ye marchèd forth the lover 'bode behind; ✿ Question of him what pains your absence could design!</div>
      <div class="line">But for the floods of tears mine eyelids rail and rain, ✿ My fires would flame on high and every land calcine.</div>
      <div class="line">To Allah make I moan of loved ones lost for aye, ✿ Who for my pine and pain no more shall pain and pine:</div>
      <div class="line">I never wronged them save that over-love I nurst: ✿ But Love departs us lovers into blest and curst.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when she had finished her repeating, the Lady Budur sat
down beside the Princess Hayat al-Nufus and kissed her on the
mouth; after which rising abruptly, she made the minor ablution
and betook herself to her devotions; nor did she leave praying till
Hayat al-Nufus fell asleep, when she slipt into bed and lay with
her back to her till morning. And when day had broke the King
and Queen came in to their daughter and asked her how she did,
whereupon she told them what she had seen, and repeated to
them the verses she had heard. Thus far concerning Hayat al-Nufus
and her father; but as regards Queen Budur she went forth
and seated herself upon the royal throne and all the Emirs and
Captains and Officers of state came up to her and wished her joy
of the kingship, kissing the earth before her and calling down blessings
upon her. And she accosted them with smiling face and
clad them in robes of honour, augmenting the fiefs of the high
officials and giving largesse to the levies; wherefore all the people
loved her and offered up prayers for the long endurance of her
reign, doubting not but that she was a man. And she ceased not
sitting all day in the hall of audience, bidding and forbidding;
dispensing justice, releasing prisoners and remitting the customs-dues,
till nightfall, when she withdrew to the apartment prepared
for her. Here she found Hayat al-Nufus seated; so she sat down
by her side and, clapping her on the back, coaxed and caressed her
and kissed her between the eyes, and fell to versifying in these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">What secret kept I these my tears have told, ✿ And my waste body must my love unfold:</div>
      <div class="line">Though hid my pine, my plight on parting-day ✿ To every envious eye my secret sold:</div>
      <div class="line">O ye who broke up camp, you've left behind ✿ My spirit wearied and my heart a-cold:</div>
      <div class="line">In my heart's core ye dwell, and now these eyne ✿ Roll blood-drops with the tears they whilome rolled:</div>
      <div class="line">The absent will I ransom with my soul; ✿ All can my yearning for their sight behold:</div>
      <div class="line">I have an eye whose babe,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1547" id="noteref-1547" epub:type="noteref">1547</a> for love of thee, ✿ Rejected sleep nor hath its tears controlled.</div>
      <div class="line">The foeman bids me patient bear his loss, ✿ Ne'er may mine ears accept the ruth he doled!</div>
      <div class="line">I trickt their deme of me, and won my wish ✿ Of Kamar al-Zaman's joys manifold:</div>
      <div class="line">He joins all perfect gifts like none before; ✿ Boasted such might and main no King of old:</div>
      <div class="line">Seeing his gifts, Bin Zá'ïdah's<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1548" id="noteref-1548" epub:type="noteref">1548</a> largesse ✿ Forget we, and Mu'áwiyah mildest-soul'd:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1549" id="noteref-1549" epub:type="noteref">1549</a></div>
      <div class="line">Were verse not feeble and o'er short the time ✿ I had in laud of him used all of rhyme.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Queen Budur stood up and wiped away her tears and,
making the lesser ablution,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1550" id="noteref-1550" epub:type="noteref">1550</a> applied her to pray: nor did she give
over praying till drowsiness overcame the Lady Hayat al-Nufus
and she slept, whereupon the Lady Budur came and lay by her
till the morning. At daybreak, she arose and prayed the dawn-prayer;
and presently seated herself on the royal throne and
passed the day in ordering and counterordering and giving laws
and administering justice. This is how it fared with her; but as
regards King Armanus he went in to his daughter and asked her
how she did; so she told him all that had befallen her and repeated
to him the verses which Queen Budur had recited, adding, "O my
father, never saw I one more abounding in sound sense and
modesty than my husband, save that he doth nothing but weep
and sigh." He answered, "O my daughter, have patience with
him yet this third night, and if he go not in unto thee and do
away thy maidenhead, we shall know how to proceed with him
and oust him from the throne and banish him the country."
And on this wise he agreed with his daughter what course he
would take——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Tenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King
Armanus had agreed with his daughter on this wise and had determined
what course he would take and night came on, Queen
Budur arose from the throne of her kingdom and betaking herself
to the palace, entered the apartment prepared for her. There she
found the wax-candles lighted and the Princess Hayat al-Nufus
seated and awaiting her; whereupon she bethought her of her
husband and what had betided them both of sorrow and severance
in so short a space; she wept and sighed and groaned groan upon
groan, and began improvising these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">News of my love fill all the land, I swear, ✿ As suns on Ghazá<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1551" id="noteref-1551" epub:type="noteref">1551</a>-wold rain heat and glare:</div>
      <div class="line">Speaketh his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">geste</span> but hard its sense to say; ✿ Thus never cease to grow my cark and care:</div>
      <div class="line">I hate fair Patience since I lovèd thee; ✿ E'er sawest lover hate for love to bear?</div>
      <div class="line">A glance that dealt love-sickness dealt me death, ✿ Glances are deadliest things with torments rare:</div>
      <div class="line">He shook his love-locks down and bared his chin, ✿ Whereby I spied his beauties dark and fair:</div>
      <div class="line">My care, my cure are in his hands; and he ✿ Who caused their dolour can their dole repair:</div>
      <div class="line">His belt went daft for softness of his waist; ✿ His hips, for envy, to uprise forbear:</div>
      <div class="line">His brow curl-diademed is murky night; ✿ Unveil't and lo! bright Morn shows brightest light.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When she had finished her versifying, she would have risen to
pray, but, lo and behold! Hayat al-Nufus caught her by the skirt
and clung to her saying, "O my lord, art thou not ashamed before
my father, after all his favour, to neglect me at such a time as
this?" When Queen Budur heard her words, she sat down in the
same place and said, "O my beloved, what is this thou sayest?"
She replied, "What I say is that I never saw any so proud of
himself as thou. Is every fair one so disdainful? I say not this to
incline thee to me; I say it only of my fear for thee from King Armanus;
because he purposeth, unless thou go in unto me this very
night, and do away my maidenhead, to strip thee of the kingship
on the morrow and banish thee his kingdom; and peradventure
his excessive anger may lead him to slay thee. But I, O my lord,
have ruth on thee and give thee fair warning; and it is thy right
to reck."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1552" id="noteref-1552" epub:type="noteref">1552</a> Now when Queen Budur heard her speak these words,
she bowed her head groundwards awhile in sore perplexity and said
in herself, "If I refuse I'm lost; and if I obey I'm shamed. But I
am now Queen of all the Ebony Islands and they are under my
rule, nor shall I ever again meet my Kamar al-Zaman save in this
place; for there is no way for him to his native land but through
the Ebony Islands. Verily, I know not what to do in my present
case, but I commit my care to Allah who directeth all for the best,
for I am no man that I should arise and open this virgin girl."
Then quoth Queen Budur to Hayat al-Nufus, "O my beloved,
that I have neglected thee and abstained from thee is in my own
despite." And she told her her whole story from beginning to
end and showed her person to her, saying, "I conjure thee by
Allah to keep my counsel, for I have concealed my case only that
Allah may reunite me with my beloved Kamar al-Zaman and then
come what may."——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eleventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Lady Budur acquainted Hayat al-Nufus with her history and bade
her keep it secret, the Princess heard her with extreme wonderment
and was moved to pity and prayed Allah to reunite her with
her beloved, saying, "Fear nothing, O my sister; but have patience
till Allah bring to pass that which must come to pass:" and she
began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">None but the men of worth a secret keep;</div>
      <div class="line">With worthy men a secret's hidden deep;</div>
      <div class="line">As in a room, so secrets lie with me,</div>
      <div class="line">Whose door is sealed, lock shot and lost the key.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1553" id="noteref-1553" epub:type="noteref">1553</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when Hayat al-Nufus had ended her verses, she said, "O my
sister, verily the breasts of the noble and brave are of secrets the
grave; and I will not discover thine." Then they toyed and embraced
and kissed and slept till near the Mu'ezzin's call to dawn-prayer,
when Hayat al-Nufus arose and took a pigeon-poult,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1554" id="noteref-1554" epub:type="noteref">1554</a> and
cut its throat over her smock and besmeared herself with its blood.
Then she pulled off her petticoat-trousers and cried aloud, whereupon
her people hastened to her and raised the usual lullilooing
and outcries of joy and gladness. Presently her mother came in
to her and asked her how she did and busied herself about her and
abode with her till evening; whilst the Lady Budur arose with
the dawn, and repaired to the bath and, after washing herself pure,
proceeded to the hall of audience, where she sat down on her
throne and dispensed justice among the folk. Now when King
Armanus heard the loud cries of joy, he asked what was the matter
and was informed of the consummation of his daughter's marriage;
whereat he rejoiced and his breast swelled with gladness and he
made a great marriage-feast whereof the merry-making lasted a
long time. Such was their case: but as regards King Shahriman
it was on this wise. After his son had fared forth to the chase
accompanied by Marzawan, as before related, he tarried patiently
awaiting their return at nightfall; but when his son did not appear,
he passed a sleepless night and the dark hours were longsome
upon him; his restlessness was excessive, his excitement grew
upon him and he thought the morning would never dawn. And
when day broke he sat expecting his son and waited till noon, but
he came not; whereat his heart forebode separation and was fired
with fears for Kamar al-Zaman; and he cried, "Alas! my son!"
and he wept till his clothes were drenched with tears, and repeated
with a beating heart:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Love's votaries I ceased not to oppose, ✿ Till doomed to taste Love's bitter and Love's sweet:</div>
      <div class="line">I drained his rigour-cup to very dregs, ✿ Self-humbled at its slaves' and freemen's feet:</div>
      <div class="line">Fortune had sworn to part the loves of us; ✿ She kept her word how truly, well I weet!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he ended his verse, he wiped away his tears and bade
his troops make ready for a march and prepare for a long expedition.
So they all mounted and set forth, headed by the Sultan,
whose heart burnt with grief and was fired with anxiety for his
son Kamar al-Zaman; and they advanced by forced marches.
Now the King divided his host into six divisions, a right wing and
a left wing, a vanguard and a rear-guard;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1555" id="noteref-1555" epub:type="noteref">1555</a> and bade them rendezvous
for the morrow at the cross-roads. Accordingly they separated
and scoured the country all the rest of that day till night,
and they marched through the night and at noon of the ensuing
day they joined company at the place where four roads met. But
they knew not which the Prince followed, till they saw the sign of
torn clothes and sighted shreds of flesh and beheld blood still
sprinkled by the way and they noted every piece of the clothes
and fragment of mangled flesh scattered on all sides. Now when
King Shahriman saw this, he cried from his heart-core a loud cry,
saying, "Alas, my son!"; and buffetted his face and pluckt his
beard and rent his raiment, doubting not but his son was dead.
Then he gave himself up to excessive weeping and wailing, and the
troops also wept for his weeping, all being assured that Prince
Kamar al-Zaman had perished. They threw dust on their heads,
and the night surprised them shedding tears and lamenting till
they were like to die. Then the King with a heart on fire and
with burning sighs spake these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Chide not the mourner for bemourning woe; ✿ Enough is yearning every Ill to show:</div>
      <div class="line">He weeps for stress of sorrow and of pain, ✿ And these to thee best evidence his lowe:</div>
      <div class="line">Happy!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1556" id="noteref-1556" epub:type="noteref">1556</a> of whom Love-sickness swore that ne'er ✿ Should cease his eyelids loving tears to flow:</div>
      <div class="line">He mourns the loss of fairest, fullest Moon, ✿ Shining o'er all his peers in glorious glow:</div>
      <div class="line">But death made drink a brimming cup, what day ✿ He fared from natal country fain to go:</div>
      <div class="line">His home left he and went from us to grief; ✿ Nor to his brethren could he say adieu:</div>
      <div class="line">Yea, his loss wounded me with parting pangs, ✿ And separation cost me many a throe:</div>
      <div class="line">He fared farewelling, as he fared, our eyes; ✿ Whenas his Lord vouchsafed him Paradise.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when King Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned
with the troops to his capital,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twelfth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King
Shahriman had ended his verses, he returned with the troops to
his capital, giving up his son for lost, and deeming that wild
beasts or banditti had set upon him and torn him to pieces; and
made proclamation that all in the Khalidan Islands should don
black in mourning for him. Moreover, he built, in his memory,
a pavilion, naming it House of Lamentations; and on Mondays
and Thursdays he devoted himself to the business of the state and
ordering the affairs of his levies and lieges; and the rest of the
week he was wont to spend in the House of Lamentations, mourning
for his son and bewailing him with elegiac verses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1557" id="noteref-1557" epub:type="noteref">1557</a> of which
the following are some:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My day of bliss is that when thou appearest; ✿ My day of bale<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1558" id="noteref-1558" epub:type="noteref">1558</a> is that whereon thou farest:</div>
      <div class="line">Though through the night I quake in dread of death; ✿ Union wi' thee is of all bliss the dearest.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And again he said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My soul be sacrifice for one, whose going ✿ Afflicted hearts with sufferings sore and dread:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Such was the case with King Shahriman; but as regards Queen
Budur daughter of King Ghayur, she abode as ruler in the Ebony
Islands, whilst the folk would point to her with their fingers, and
say, "Yonder is the son-in-law of King Armanus." And every
night she lay with Hayat al-Nufus, to whom she lamented her
desolate state and longing for her husband Kamar al-Zaman,
weeping and describing to her his beauty and loveliness, and
yearning to enjoy him though but in a dream: And at times she
would repeat:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Well Allah wots that since my severance from thee, ✿ I wept till forced to borrow tears at usury:</div>
      <div class="line">"Patience!" my blamer cried, "Heartsease right soon shalt see!" ✿ Quoth I, "Say, blamer, where may home of Patience be?"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>This is how it fared with Queen Budur; but as regards Kamar
al-Zaman, he abode with the gardener in the garden for no short
time, weeping night and day and repeating verses bewailing the
past time of enjoyment and delight; whilst the gardener kept
comforting him and assuring him that the ship would set sail for
the land of the Moslems at the end of the year. And in this
condition he continued till one day he saw the folk crowding
together and wondered at this; but the gardener came in to him
and said, "O my son, give over work for this day nor lead water
to the trees; for it is a festival day, whereon folk visit one another.
So take thy rest and only keep thine eye on the garden, whilst I
go look after the ship for thee; for yet but a little while and I
send thee to the land of the Moslems." Upon this, he went forth
from the garden leaving to himself Kamar al-Zaman, who fell to
musing upon his case till his heart was like to break and the tears
streamed from his eyes. So he wept with excessive weeping till
he swooned away and, when he recovered, he rose and walked
about the garden, pondering what Time had done with him and
bewailing the long endurance of his estrangement and separation
from those he loved. As he was thus absorbed in melancholy
thought, his foot stumbled and he fell on his face, his forehead
striking against the projecting root of a tree; and the blow cut
it open and his blood ran down and mingled with his tears.
Then he rose and, wiping away the blood, dried his tears and
bound his brow with a piece of rag; then continued his walk
about the garden engrossed by sad reverie. Presently, he looked
up at a tree and saw two birds quarrelling thereon, and one of them
rose up and smote the other with its beak on the neck and severed
from its body its head, wherewith it flew away, whilst the slain
bird fell to the ground before Kamar al-Zaman. As it lay, behold,
two great birds swooped down upon it alighting, one at the head
and the other at the tail, and both drooped their wings and bowed
their bills over it and, extending their necks towards it, wept.
Kamar al-Zaman also wept when seeing the birds thus bewail
their mate, and called to mind his wife and father,——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased to day her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar al-Zaman
wept and lamented his separation from spouse and sire,
when he beheld those two birds weeping over their mate. Then
he looked at the twain and saw them dig a grave and therein bury
the slain bird; after which they flew away far into the firmament
and disappeared for a while; but presently they returned with the
murtherer-bird and, alighting on the grave of the murthered,
stamped on the slayer till they had done him to death. Then
they rent his belly and tearing out his entrails, poured the blood
on the grave of the slain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1561" id="noteref-1561" epub:type="noteref">1561</a>: moreover, they stripped off his skin
and tare his flesh in pieces and, pulling out the rest of the bowels,
scattered them hither and thither. All this while Kamar al-Zaman
was watching them wonderingly; but presently, chancing
to look at the place where the two birds had slain the third, he
saw therein something gleaming. So he drew near to it and noted
that it was the crop of the dead bird. Whereupon he took it and
opened it and found the talisman which had been the cause of his
separation from his wife. But when he saw it and knew it, he fell
to the ground a-fainting for joy; and, when he revived, he said,
"Praised be Allah! This is a foretaste of good and a presage
of reunion with my beloved." Then he examined the jewel and
passed it over his eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1562" id="noteref-1562" epub:type="noteref">1562</a>; after which he bound it to his forearm,
rejoicing in coming weal, and walked about till nightfall awaiting
the gardener's return; and when he came not, he lay down and
slept in his wonted place. At daybreak he rose to his work and,
girding his middle with a cord of palm-fibre, took hatchet and
basket and walked down the length of the garden, till he came to
a carob-tree and struck the axe into its roots. The blow rang and
resounded; so he cleared away the soil from the place and discovered
a trap-door and raised it.——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fourteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Kamar
al-Zaman raised the trap-door, he found a winding stair, which he
descended and came to an ancient vault of the time of Ad and
Thamúd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1563" id="noteref-1563" epub:type="noteref">1563</a> hewn out of the rock. Round the vault stood many
brazen vessels of the bigness of a great oil-jar which he found full
of gleaming red gold: whereupon he said to himself, "Verily sorrow
is gone and solace is come!" Then he mounted from the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">souterrain</span> to the garden and, replacing the trap-door as it was
before, busied himself in conducting water to the trees till the last
of the day, when the gardener came back and said to him, "O my
son, rejoice at the good tidings of a speedy return to thy native
land: the merchants are ready equipped for the voyage and the
ship in three days' time will set sail for the City of Ebony, which
is the first of the cities of the Moslems; and after making it, thou
must travel by land a six months' march till thou come to the
Islands of Khalidan, the dominions of King Shahriman." At
this Kamar al-Zaman rejoiced and began repeating:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Part not from one whose wont is not to part from you; ✿ Nor with your cruel taunts an innocent mortify:</div>
      <div class="line">Another so long-parted had ta'en heart from you, ✿ And had his whole condition changed,—but not so I.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he kissed the gardener's hand and said, "O my father, even
as thou hast brought me glad tidings, so I also have great good
news for thee," and told him anent his discovery of the vault;
whereat the gardener rejoiced and said, "O my son, fourscore
years have I dwelt in this garden and have never hit on aught;
whilst thou, who hast not sojourned with me a year, hast discovered
this thing; wherefore it is Heaven's gift to thee, which
shall end thy crosses and aid thee to rejoin thy folk and foregather
with her thou lovest." Quoth Kamar al-Zaman, "There is no help
but it must be shared between me and thee." Then he carried him
to the underground-chamber and showed him the gold, which was
in twenty jars: he took ten and the gardener ten, and the old man
said to him, "O my son, fill thyself leather bottles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1564" id="noteref-1564" epub:type="noteref">1564</a> with the
sparrow-olives<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1565" id="noteref-1565" epub:type="noteref">1565</a> which grow in this garden, for they are not found
except in our land; and the merchants carry them to all parts.
Lay the gold in the bottles and strew it over with olives: then stop
them and cover them and take them with thee in the ship." So
Kamar al-Zaman arose without stay or delay and took fifty leather
bottles and stored in each somewhat of the gold, and closed each
one after placing a layer of olives over the gold; and at the bottom
of one of the bottles he laid the talisman. Then sat he down to
talk with the gardener, confident of speedy reunion with his own
people and saying to himself, "When I come to the Ebony Islands
I will journey thence to my father's country and enquire for my
beloved Budur. Would to Heaven I knew whether she returned
to her own land or journeyed on to my father's country or whether
there befel her any accident by the way." And he began versifying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Love in my breast they lit and fared away, ✿ And far the land wherein my love is pent:</div>
      <div class="line">Far lies the camp and those who camp therein; ✿ Far is her tent-shrine, where I ne'er shall tent.</div>
      <div class="line">Patience far fled me when from me they fled; ✿ Sleep failed mine eyes, endurance was forspent:</div>
      <div class="line">They left and with them left my every joy, ✿ Wending with them, nor find I peace that went:</div>
      <div class="line">They made these eyes roll down love-tears in flood, ✿ And lacking them these eyne with tears are drent.</div>
      <div class="line">When my triste spirit once again would see them, ✿ When pine and expectation but augment,</div>
      <div class="line">In my heart's core their counterfeits I trace, ✿ With love and yearning to behold their grace.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, while he awaited the end of the term of days, he told the
gardener the tale of the birds and what had passed between them;
whereat the hearer wondered; and they both lay down and slept
till the morning. The gardener awoke sick and abode thus two
days; but on the third day, his sickness increased on him, till
they despaired of his life and Kamar al-Zaman grieved with sore
grief for him. Meanwhile behold, the Master and his crew came
and enquired for the gardener; and, when Kamar al-Zaman told
them that he was sick, they asked, "Where be the youth who is
minded to go with us to the Ebony Islands?" "He is your servant
and he standeth before you!" answered the Prince and bade
them carry the bottles of olives to the ship; so they transported
them, saying, "Make haste, thou, for the wind is fair;" and he replied,
"I hear and obey." Then he carried his provaunt on board
and, returning to bid the gardener farewell, found him in the
agonies of death; so he sat down at his head and closed his eyes,
and his soul departed his body; whereupon he laid him out and
committed him to the earth unto the mercy of Allah Almighty.
Then he made for the ship but found that she had already weighed
anchor and set sail; nor did she cease to cleave the seas till she
disappeared from his sight. So he went back to whence he came
heavy-hearted with whirling head; and neither would he address
a soul nor return a reply; and reaching the garden and sitting
down in cark and care he threw dust on his head and buffeted his
cheeks.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Fifteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
ship sped on her course, Kamar al-Zaman returned to the garden
in cark and care; but anon he rented the place of its owner and
hired a man to help him in irrigating the trees. Moreover, he repaired
the trap-door and he went to the underground chamber and
bringing the rest of the gold to grass, stowed it in other fifty
bottles which he filled up with a layer of olives. Then he enquired
of the ship and they told him that it sailed but once a year; at
which his trouble of mind redoubled and he cried sore for that
which had betided him, above all for the loss of the Princess
Budur's talisman, and spent his nights and days weeping and repeating
verses. Such was his case; but as regards the ship she
sailed with a favouring wind till she reached the Ebony Islands.
Now by decree of destiny, Queen Budur was sitting at a lattice-window
overlooking the sea and saw the galley cast anchor upon
the strand. At this sight, her heart throbbed and she took horse
with the Chamberlains and Nabobs and, riding down to the shore,
halted by the ship, whilst the sailors broke bulk and bore the bales
to the storehouses; after which she called the captain to her presence
and asked what he had with him. He answered "O King,
I have with me in this ship aromatic drugs and cosmetics and
healing powders and ointments and plasters and precious metals
and rich stuffs and rugs of Yemen leather, not to be borne of mule
or camel, and all manner of ottars and spices and perfumes, civet
and ambergris and camphor and Sumatra aloes-wood, and tamarinds<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1566" id="noteref-1566" epub:type="noteref">1566</a>
and sparrow-olives to boot, such as are rare to find in this
country." When she heard talk of sparrow-olives her heart longed
for them and she said to the ship-master, "How much of olives
hast thou?" He replied, "Fifty bottles full, but their owner is
not with us; so the King shall take what he will of them." Quoth
she, "Bring them ashore, that I may see them." Thereupon he
called to the sailors, who brought her the fifty bottles; and she
opened one and, looking at the olives, said to the captain, "I will
take the whole fifty and pay you their value, whatso it be." He
answered, "By Allah, O my lord, they have no value in our
country; moreover their shipper tarried behind us, and he is a poor
man." Asked she, "And what are they worth here?" and he
answered "A thousand dirhams." "I will take them at a thousand,"
she said and bade them carry the fifty bottles to the palace.
When it was night, she called for a bottle of olives and opened it,
there being none in the room but herself and the Princess Hayat
al-Nufus. Then, placing a dish before her she turned into it the
contents of the jar, when there fell out into the dish with the olives
a heap of red gold; and she said to the Lady Hayat al-Nufus,
"This is naught but gold!" So she sent for the rest of the bottles
and found them all full of precious metal and scarce enough olives
to fill a single jar. Moreover, she sought among the gold and
found therein the talisman, which she took and examined and
behold, it was that which Kamar al-Zaman had taken from off the
band of her petticoat trousers. Thereupon she cried out for joy
and slipped down in a swoon;——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Sixteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King
Budur saw the talisman she cried out for joy and slipped down in
a swoon; and when she recovered she said to herself, "Verily, this
talisman was the cause of my separation from my beloved Kamar
al-Zaman; but now it is an omen of good." Then she showed it
to Hayat al-Nufus and said to her, "This was the cause of disunion
and now, please Allah, it shall be the cause of reunion." As
soon as day dawned she seated herself on the royal throne and
sent for the ship-master, who came into the presence and kissed
the ground before her. Quoth she, "Where didst thou leave the
owner of these olives?" Quoth he, "O King of the age, we left
him in the land of the Magians and he is a gardener there." She
rejoined, "Except thou bring him to me, thou knowest not the
harm which awaiteth thee and thy ship." Then she bade them
seal up the magazines of the merchants and said to them, "Verily
the owner of these olives hath borrowed of me and I have a claim
upon him for debt and, unless ye bring him to me, I will without
fail do you all die and seize your goods." So they went to the
captain and promised him the hire of the ship, if he would go and
return a second time, saying, "Deliver us from this masterful
tyrant." Accordingly the skipper embarked and set sail and
Allah decreed him a prosperous voyage, till he came to the Island
of the Magians and, landing by night, went up to the garden.
Now the night was long upon Kamar al-Zaman, and he sat,
bethinking him of his beloved, and bewailing what had befallen
him and versifying:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">A night whose stars refused to run their course, ✿ A night of those which never seem outworn:</div>
      <div class="line">Like Resurrection-day, of longsome length<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1567" id="noteref-1567" epub:type="noteref">1567</a> ✿ To him that watched and waited for the morn.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now at this moment, the captain knocked at the garden-gate, and
Kamar al-Zaman opened and went out to him, whereupon the
crew seized him and went down with him on board the ship and
set sail forthright; and they ceased not voyaging days and nights,
whilst Kamar al-Zaman knew not why they dealt thus with him;
but when he questioned them they replied, "Thou hast offended
against the Lord of the Ebony Islands, the son-in-law of King
Armanus, and thou hast stolen his monies, miserable that thou
art!" Said he, "By Allah! I never entered that country nor do I
know where it is!" However, they fared on with him, till they
made the Ebony Islands and landing, carried him up to the Lady
Budur, who knew him at sight and said, "Leave him with the
eunuchs, that they may take him to the bath." Then she relieved
the merchants of the embargo and gave the captain a robe of
honour worth ten thousand pieces of gold; and, after returning to
the palace, she went in that night to the Princess Hayat al-Nufus
and told her what had passed, saying, "Keep thou my counsel,
till I accomplish my purpose, and do a deed which shall be
recorded and shall be read by Kings and commoners after we be
dead and gone." And when she gave orders that they bear Kamar
al-Zaman to the bath, they did so and clad him in a royal habit so
that, when he came forth, he resembled a willow-bough or a star
which shamed the greater and lesser light<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1568" id="noteref-1568" epub:type="noteref">1568</a> and its glow, and his
life and soul returned to his frame. Then he repaired to the
palace and went in to the Princess Budur; and when she saw him
she schooled her heart to patience, till she should have accomplished
her purpose; and she bestowed on him Mamelukes and
eunuchs, camels and mules. Moreover, she gave him a treasury of
money and she ceased not advancing him from dignity to dignity,
till she made him Lord High Treasurer and committed to his
charge all the treasures of the state; and she admitted him to
familiar favour and acquainted the Emirs with his rank and
dignity. And all loved him, for Queen Budur did not cease day
by day to increase his allowances. As for Kamar al-Zaman, he
was at a loss anent the reason of her thus honouring him; and he
gave gifts and largesse out of the abundance of the wealth; and
he devoted himself to the service of King Armanus; so that the
King and all the Emirs and people, great and small, adored him
and were wont to swear by his life. Nevertheless, he ever marvelled
at the honour and favour shown him by Queen Budur and
said to himself, "By Allah, there needs must be a reason for this
affection! Peradventure, this King favoureth me not with these
immoderate favours save for some ill purpose and, therefore,
there is no help but that I crave leave of him to depart his
realm." So he went in to Queen Budur and said to her, "O
King, thou hast overwhelmed me with favours, but it will fulfil
the measure of thy bounties if thou take from me all thou hast
been pleased to bestow upon me, and permit me to depart." She
smiled and asked, "What maketh thee seek to depart and plunge
into new perils, whenas thou art in the enjoyment of the highest
favour and greatest prosperity?" Answered Kamar al-Zaman,
"O King, verily this favour, if there be no reason for it, is indeed
a wonder of wonders, more by token that thou hast advanced me
to dignities such as befit men of age and experience, albeit I am
as it were a young child." And Queen Budur rejoined, "The
reason is that I love thee for thine exceeding loveliness and thy
surpassing beauty; and if thou wilt but grant me my desire of
thy body, I will advance thee yet farther in honour and favour
and largesse; and I will make thee Wazir, for all thy tender age,
even as the folk made me Sultan over them and I no older than
thou; so that nowadays there is nothing strange when children
take the head and by Allah, he was a gifted man who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">It seems as though of Lot's tribe were our days, ✿ And crave with love to advance the young in years."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1569" id="noteref-1569" epub:type="noteref">1569</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, he was abashed and
his cheeks flushed till they seemed a-flame; and he said, "I need
not these favours which lead to the commission of sin; I will live
poor in wealth but wealthy in virtue and honour." Quoth she,
"I am not to be duped by thy scruples, arising from prudery and
coquettish ways; and Allah bless him who saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">To him I spake of coupling, but he said to me, ✿ 'How long this noyous long persistency?'</div>
      <div class="line">But when gold piece I showèd him, he cried, ✿ 'Who from the Almighty Sovereign e'er shall flee?'"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Kamar al-Zaman, heard these words and understood
her verses and their import, he said, "O King, I have not the
habit of these doings, nor have I strength to bear these heavy
burthens for which elder than I have proved unable; then how
will it be with my tender age?" But she smiled at his speech
and retorted, "Indeed, it is a matter right marvellous how error
springeth from the disorder of man's intendiment! Since thou
art a boy, why standest thou in fear of sin or the doing of things
forbidden, seeing that thou art not yet come to years of canonical
responsibility; and the offences of a child incur neither punishment
nor reproof? Verily, thou hast committed thyself to a
quibble for the sake of contention, and it is thy duty to bow
before a proposal of fruition, so henceforward cease from denial
and coyness, for the commandment of Allah is a decree foreordained:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1570" id="noteref-1570" epub:type="noteref">1570</a>
indeed, I have more reason than thou to fear falling
and by sin to be misled; and well-inspired was he who said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">My prickle is big and the little one said, ✿ Thrust boldly in vitals with lion-like stroke!</div>
      <div class="line">Then I, 'Tis a sin!; and he, No sin to me! ✿ So I had him at once with a counterfeit poke."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1571" id="noteref-1571" epub:type="noteref">1571</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard these words, the light became darkness
in his sight and he said, "O King, thou hast in thy household
fair women and female slaves, who have not their like in this age:
shall not these suffice thee without me? Do thy will with them
and let me go!" She replied, "Thou sayest sooth, but it is not
with them that one who loveth thee can heal himself of torment
and can abate his fever; for, when tastes and inclinations are
corrupted by vice, they hear and obey other than good advice.
So leave arguing and listen to what the poet saith:—</p>

<p>When Kamar al-Zaman heard her quote this poetry, and was
certified that there was no escaping compliance with what willed
she, he said, "O King of the age, if thou must needs have it so,
make covenant with me that thou wilt do this thing with me but
once, though it avail not to correct thy depraved appetite; and
that thou wilt never again require this thing of me to the end of
time; so perchance shall Allah purge me of the sin." She replied,
"I promise thee this same, hoping that Allah of His favour will
relent towards us and blot out our mortal offence; for the girdle
of heaven's forgiveness is not indeed so strait, but it may compass
us around and absolve us of the excess of our heinous sins and
bring us to the light of salvation out of the darkness of error; and
indeed excellently well saith the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Of evil thing the folk suspect us twain; ✿ And to this thought their hearts and souls are bent:</div>
      <div class="line">Come, dear! let's justify and free their souls ✿ That wrong us; one good bout and then—repent!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1580" id="noteref-1580" epub:type="noteref">1580</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Thereupon she made with him an agreement and a covenant and
swore a solemn oath by Him who is Self-existent, that this thing
should befal betwixt them but once and never again for all time,
and that the desire of him was driving her to death and perdition.
So he rose up with her, on this condition, and went with her to
her own boudoir, that she might quench the lowe of her lust,
saying, "There is no Majesty, and there is no Might save in Allah,
the Glorious, the Great! This is the fated decree of the All-powerful,
the All-wise!"; and he doffed his bag-trousers, shamefull
and abashed, with the tears running from his eyes for stress of
affright. Thereat she smiled and making him mount upon a couch
with her, said to him, "After this night, thou shalt see naught that
will offend thee." Then she turned to him bussing and bosoming
him and bending calf over calf, and said to him, "Put thy hand
between my thighs to the accustomed place; so haply it may stand
up to prayer after prostration." He wept and cried, "I am not
good at aught of this," but she said, "By my life, an thou do as I
bid thee, it shall profit thee!" So he put out his hand, with vitals
a-fire for confusion, and found her thighs cooler than cream and
softer than silk. The touching of them pleasured him and he
moved his hand hither and thither, till it came to a dome abounding
in good gifts and movements and shifts, and said in himself,
"Perhaps this King is an hermaphrodite,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1581" id="noteref-1581" epub:type="noteref">1581</a> neither man nor woman
quite;" so he said to her, "O King, I cannot find that thou hast a
tool like the tools of men; what then moved thee to do this
deed?" Then loudly laughed Queen Budur till she fell on her
back,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1582" id="noteref-1582" epub:type="noteref">1582</a> and said, "O my dearling, how quickly thou hast forgotten
the nights we have lain together!" Then she made herself known
to him, and he knew her for his wife, the Lady Budur, daughter of
King al-Ghayur, Lord of the Isles and the Seas. So he embraced
her and she embraced him, and he kissed her and she kissed him;
then they lay down on the bed of pleasure voluptuous, repeating
the words of the poet:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">When his softly bending shape bid him close to my embrace ✿ Which clipt him all about like the tendrils of the vine,</div>
      <div class="line">And shed a flood of softness on the hardness of his heart, ✿ He yielded; though at first he was minded to decline;</div>
      <div class="line">And dreading lest the railer's eye should light upon his form, ✿ Came armourèd with caution to baffle his design:</div>
      <div class="line">His waist makes moan of hinder cheeks that weigh upon his feet ✿ Like heavy load of merchandise upon young camel li'en;</div>
      <div class="line">Girt with his glances' scymitar which seemed athirst for blood, ✿ And clad in mail of dusky curls that show the sheeniest shine,</div>
      <div class="line">His fragrance wafted happy news of footstep coming nigh, ✿ And to him like a bird uncaged I flew in straightest line:</div>
      <div class="line">I spread my cheek upon his path, beneath his sandal-shoon, ✿ And lo! the stibium<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1583" id="noteref-1583" epub:type="noteref">1583</a> of their dust healed all my hurt of eyne.</div>
      <div class="line">With one embrace again I bound the banner of our loves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1584" id="noteref-1584" epub:type="noteref">1584</a> ✿ And loosed the knot of my delight that bound in bonds malign:</div>
      <div class="line">Then bade I make high festival, and straight came flocking in ✿ Pure joys that know not grizzled age<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1585" id="noteref-1585" epub:type="noteref">1585</a> nor aught of pain and pine:</div>
      <div class="line">The full moon dotted with the stars the lips and pearly teeth ✿ That dance right joyously upon the bubbling face of wine:</div>
      <div class="line">So in the prayer-niche of their joys I yielded me to what ✿ Would make the humblest penitent of sinner most indign.</div>
      <div class="line">I swear by all the signs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1586" id="noteref-1586" epub:type="noteref">1586</a> of those glories in his face ✿ I'll ne'er forget the Chapter entituled Al-Ikhlas.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1587" id="noteref-1587" epub:type="noteref">1587</a></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Queen Budur told Kamar al-Zaman all that had befallen
her from beginning to end and he did likewise; after which he
began to upbraid her, saying, "What moved thee to deal with me
as thou hast done this night?" She replied, "Pardon me! for I
did this by way of jest, and that pleasure and gladness might be
increased." And when dawned the morn and day arose with its
sheen and shone, she sent to King Armanus, sire of the Lady
Hayat al-Nufus, and acquainted him with the truth of the case
and that she was wife to Kamar al-Zaman. Moreover, she told
him their tale and the cause of their separation, and how his
daughter was a virgin, pure as when she was born. He marvelled
at their story with exceeding marvel and bade them chronicle it
in letters of gold. Then he turned to Kamar al-Zaman and said,
"O King's son, art thou minded to become my son-in-law by
marrying my daughter?" Replied he, "I must consult the
Queen Budur, as she hath a claim upon me for benefits without
stint." And when he took counsel with her, she said, "Right is
thy recking; marry her and I will be her handmaid; for I am her
debtor for kindness and favour and good offices, and obligations
manifold, especially as we are here in her place and as the King
her father hath whelmed us with benefits."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1588" id="noteref-1588" epub:type="noteref">1588</a> Now when he saw
that she inclined to this and was not jealous of Hayat al-Nufus,
he agreed with her upon this matter——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Seventeenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Kamar
al-Zaman agreed with his wife, Queen Budur, upon this matter
and told King Armanus what she had said; whereat he rejoiced
with great joy. Then he went out and, seating himself upon his
chair of estate, assembled all the Wazirs, Emirs, Chamberlains
and Grandees, to whom he related the whole story of Kamar
al-Zaman and his wife, Queen Budur, from first to last; and
acquainted them with his desire to marry his daughter Hayat
al-Nufus to the Prince and make him King in the stead of Queen
Budur. Whereupon said they all, "Since he is the husband of
Queen Budur, who hath been our King till now, whilst we deemed
her son-in-law to King Armanus, we are all content to have him
to Sultan over us; and we will be his servants, nor will we swerve
from his allegiance." So Armanus rejoiced hereat and, summoning
Kazis and witnesses and the chief officers of state, bade draw
up the contract of marriage between Kamar al-Zaman and his
daughter, the Princess Hayat al-Nufus. Then he held high
festival, giving sumptuous marriage-feasts and bestowing costly
dresses of honour upon all the Emirs and Captains of the host;
moreover he distributed alms to the poor and needy and set free
all the prisoners. The whole world rejoiced in the coming of
Kamar al-Zaman to the throne, blessing him and wishing him
endurance of glory and prosperity, renown and felicity; and, as
soon as he became King, he remitted the customs-dues and
released all men who remained in gaol. Thus he abode a long
while, ordering himself worthily towards his lieges; and he lived
with his two wives in peace, happiness, constancy and content,
lying the night with each of them in turn. He ceased not after
this fashion during many years, for indeed all his troubles and
afflictions were blotted out from him and he forgot his father King
Shahriman and his former estate of honour and favour with him.
After a while Almighty Allah blessed him with two boy children,
as they were two shining moons, through his two wives; the elder
whose name was Prince Amjad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1589" id="noteref-1589" epub:type="noteref">1589</a> by Queen Budur, and the
younger whose name was Prince As'ad by Queen Hayat al-Nufus;
and this one was comelier than his brother. They were
reared in splendour and tender affection, in respectful bearing
and in the perfection of training; and they were instructed in
penmanship and science and the arts of government and horsemanship,
till they attained the extreme of accomplishments and
the utmost limit of beauty and loveliness; both men and women
being ravished by their charms. They grew up side by side till
they reached the age of seventeen, eating and drinking together
and sleeping in one bed, nor ever parting at any time or tide;
wherefore all the people envied them. Now when they came to
man's estate and were endowed with every perfection, their father
was wont, as often as he went on a journey, to make them sit in
his stead by turns in the hall of judgement; and each did justice
among the folk one day at a time. But it came to pass, by confirmed
fate and determined lot, that love for As'ad (son of Queen
Hayat al-Nufus) rose in the heart of Queen Budur, and that affection
for Amjad (son of Queen Budur) rose in the heart of Queen
Hayat al-Nufus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1590" id="noteref-1590" epub:type="noteref">1590</a> Hence it was that each of the women used to
sport and play with the son of her sister-wife, kissing him and
straining him to her bosom, whilst each mother thought that the
other's behaviour arose but from maternal affection. On this wise
passion got the mastery of the two women's hearts and they became
madly in love with the two youths, so that when the other's
son came in to either of them, she would press him to her breast
and long for him never to be parted from her; till, at last, when
waiting grew longsome to them and they found no path to enjoyment,
they refused meat and drink and banished the solace of
sleep. Presently, the King fared forth to course and chase, bidding
his two sons sit to do justice in his stead, each one day in
turn, as was their wont.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of
day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Eighteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the King
fared forth to sport and hunt, bidding his two sons sit to do justice
in his stead, each one day by turn, as was their wont. Now Prince
Amjad sat in judgement the first day, bidding and forbidding, appointing
and deposing, giving and refusing; and Queen Hayat al-Nufus,
mother of As'ad, wrote to him a letter suing for his favour
and discovering to him her passion and devotion; altogether putting
off the mask and giving him to know that she desired to enjoy
him. So she took a scroll and thereon indited these cadences:—From
the love deranged ✿ the sorrowful and estranged ✿ whose
torment is prolonged for the longing of thee! ✿ Were I to recount
to thee the extent of my care ✿ and what of sadness I bear ✿ the
passion which my heart doth tear ✿ and all that I endure for
weeping and unrest ✿ and the rending of my sorrowful breast ✿
my unremitting grief ✿ and my woe without relief ✿ and all my
suffering for severance of thee ✿ and sadness and love's ardency ✿
no letter could contain it; nor calculation could compass it ✿
Indeed earth and heaven upon me are strait; and I have no hope
and no trust but what from thee I await ✿ Upon death I am come
nigh ✿ and the horrors of dissolution I aby ✿ Burning upon me
is sore ✿ with parting pangs and estrangement galore ✿ Were I
to set forth the yearnings that possess me more and more ✿ no
scrolls would suffice to hold such store ✿ and of the excess of my
pain and pine, I have made the following lines:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Were I to dwell on heart-consuming heat, ✿ Unease and transports in my spirit meet,</div>
      <div class="line">Nothing were left of ink and reeden pen ✿ Nor aught of paper; no, not e'en a sheet.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Queen Hayat al-Nufus wrapped up her letter in a piece of
costly silk scented with musk and ambergris; and folded it up
with her silken hair-strings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1591" id="noteref-1591" epub:type="noteref">1591</a> whose cost swallowed down treasures;
laid it in a handkerchief and gave it to a eunuch bidding him bear
it to Prince Amjad.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Nineteenth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that she gave her
missive to the eunuch in waiting and bade him bear it to Prince
Amjad. And that eunuch went forth ignoring what the future hid
for him (for the Omniscient ordereth events even as He willeth);
and, going in to the Prince, kissed the ground between his hands
and handed to him the letter. On receiving the kerchief he opened
it and, reading the epistle and recognising its gist he was ware that
his father's wife was essentially an adulteress and a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traitress</span> at
heart to her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman. So he waxed wroth
with exceeding wrath and railed at women and their works, saying,
"Allah curse women, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traitresses</span>, the imperfect in reason
and religion!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1592" id="noteref-1592" epub:type="noteref">1592</a> Then he drew his sword and said to the eunuch,
"Out on thee, thou wicked slave! Dost thou carry messages of
disloyalty for thy lord's wife? By Allah, there is no good in thee,
O black of hue and heart, O foul of face and Nature's forming!"
So he smote him on the neck and severed his head from his body;
then, folding the kerchief over its contents he thrust it into his
breast-pocket and went in to his own mother and told her what
had passed, reviling and reproaching her, and saying, "Each one
of you is viler than the other; and, by Allah the Great and
Glorious, did I not fear ill-manneredly to transgress against the
rights of my father, Kamar al-Zaman, and my brother, Prince
As'ad, I would assuredly go in to her and cut off her head, even
as I cut off that of her eunuch!" Then he went forth from his
mother in a mighty rage; and when the news reached Queen
Hayat al-Nufus of what he had done with her eunuch, she abused
him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1593" id="noteref-1593" epub:type="noteref">1593</a> and cursed him and plotted perfidy against him. He passed
the night, sick with rage, wrath and concern; nor found he pleasure
in meat, drink or sleep. And when the next morning dawned
Prince As'ad fared forth in his turn to rule the folk in his father's
stead, whilst his mother, Hayat al-Nufus, awoke in feeble plight
because of what she had heard from Prince Amjad concerning the
slaughter of her eunuch. So Prince As'ad sat in the audience-chamber
that day, judging and administering justice, appointing
and deposing, bidding and forbidding, giving and bestowing. And
he ceased not thus till near the time of afternoon-prayer, when
Queen Budur sent for a crafty old woman and, discovering to her
what was in her heart, wrote a letter to Prince As'ad, complaining
of the excess of her affection and desire for him in these cadenced
lines:—"From her who perisheth for passion and love-forlorn ✿ to
him who in nature and culture is goodliest born ✿ to him who is conceited
of his own loveliness ✿ and glories in his amorous grace ✿
who from those that seek to enjoy him averteth his face ✿ and refuseth
to show favour unto the self abasing and base ✿ him who is
cruel and of disdainful mood ✿ from the lover despairing of good ✿
to Prince As'ad ✿ with passing beauty endowed ✿ and of excelling
grace proud ✿ of the face moon-bright ✿ and the brow flower-white
✿ and dazzling splendid light ✿ This is my letter to him whose love
melteth my body ✿ and rendeth my skin and bones! ✿ Know that
my patience faileth me quite ✿ and I am perplexed in my plight ✿
longing and restlessness weary me ✿ and sleep and patience deny
themselves to me ✿ but mourning and watching stick fast to me ✿
and desire and passion torment me ✿ and the extremes of languor
and sickness have shent me ✿ Yet may my life be a ransom for
thee ✿ albeit thy pleasure be to slay her who loveth thee ✿ and
Allah prolong the life of thee ✿ and preserve thee from all infirmity!"
And after these cadences she wrote these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Fate hath commanded I become thy <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">fere</span>, ✿ O shining like full moon when clearest clear!</div>
      <div class="line">All beauty dost embrace, all eloquence; ✿ Brighter than aught within our worldly sphere:</div>
      <div class="line">Content am I my torturer thou be: ✿ Haply shalt alms me with one lovely leer!</div>
      <div class="line">Happy her death who dieth for thy love! ✿ No good in her who holdeth thee undear!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And also the following couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Unto thee, As'ad! I of passion-pangs complain; ✿ Have ruth on slave of love so burnt with flaming pain:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then Queen Budur perfumed the letter-paper with a profusion of
odoriferous musk and, winding it in her hair-strings which were of
Iráki silk, with pendants of oblong emeralds, set with pearls and
stones of price, delivered it to the old woman, bidding her carry
it to Prince As'ad.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1594" id="noteref-1594" epub:type="noteref">1594</a> She did so in order to pleasure her, and
going in to the Prince, straightway and without stay, found him
in his own rooms and delivered to him the letter in privacy; after
which she stood waiting an hour or so for the answer. When
As'ad had read the paper and knew its purport, he wrapped it up
again in the ribbons and put it in his bosom-pocket: then (for he
was wroth beyond all measure of wrath) he cursed false women
and sprang up and drawing his sword, smote the old trot on
the neck and cut off her pate. Thereupon he went in to his
mother, Queen Hayat al-Nufus, whom he found lying on her bed
in feeble case, for that which had betided her with Prince Amjad,
and railed at her and cursed her; after which he left her and foregathered
with his brother, to whom he related all that had befallen
him with Queen Budur, adding, "By Allah, O my brother, but
that I was ashamed before thee, I had gone in to her forthright
and had smitten her head off her shoulders!" Replied Prince
Amjad, "By Allah, O my brother, yesterday when I was sitting
upon the seat of judgement, the like of what hath befallen thee
this day befel me also with thy mother who sent me a letter of
similar purport." And he told him all that had passed, adding,
"By Allah, O my brother, naught but respect for thee withheld
me from going in to her and dealing with her even as I dealt with
the eunuch!" They passed the rest of the night conversing and
cursing false womankind, and agreed to keep the matter secret,
lest their father should hear of it and kill the two women. Yet
they ceased not to suffer trouble and foresee affliction. And when
the morrow dawned, the King returned with his suite from hunting
and sat awhile in his chair of estate; after which he sent the Emirs
about their business and went up to his palace, where he found his
two wives lying a-bed and both exceeding sick and weak. Now
they had made a plot against their two sons and concerted to do
away their lives, for that they had exposed themselves before them
and feared to be at their mercy and dependent upon their forbearance.
When Kamar al-Zaman saw them on this wise, he said to
them, "What aileth you?" Whereupon they rose to him and
kissing his hands answered, perverting the case and saying,
"Know, O King, that thy two sons, who have been reared in
thy bounty, have played thee false and have dishonoured thee in
the persons of thy wives." Now when he heard this, the light
became darkness in his sight, and he raged with such wrath that
his reason fled: then said he to them, "Explain me this matter."
Replied Queen Budur, "O King of the age, know that these many
days past thy son As'ad hath been in the persistent habit of sending
me letters and messages to solicit me to lewdness and adultery
while I still forbade him from this, but he would not be forbidden;
and, when thou wentest forth to hunt, he rushed in on me, drunk
and with a drawn sword in his hand, and smiting my eunuch, slew
him. Then he mounted on my breast, still holding the sword, and
I feared lest he should slay me, if I gainsaid him, even as he had
slain my eunuch; so he took his wicked will of me by force. And
now if thou do me not justice on him, O King, I will slay myself
with my own hand, for I have no need of life in the world after
this foul deed." And Queen Hayat al-Nufus, choking with tears,
told him respecting Prince Amjad a story like that of her sister-wife.——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twentieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Queen
Hayat al-Nufus told her husband, King Kamar al-Zaman, a story
like that of her sister in wedlock, Budur, and, quoth she, "The
same thing befel me with thy son Amjad;" after which she took to
weeping and wailing and said, "Except thou do me justice on him
I will tell my father, King Armanus." Then both women wept
with sore weeping before King Kamar al-Zaman who, when he
saw their tears and heard their words, concluded that their story
was true and, waxing wroth beyond measure of wrath, went forth
thinking to fall upon his two sons and put them to death. On his
way he met his father-in-law, King Armanus who, hearing of his
return from the chase, had come to salute him at that very hour;
and, seeing him with naked brand in hand and blood dripping
from his nostrils, for excess of rage, asked what ailed him. So
Kamar al-Zaman told him all that his sons Amjad and As'ad had
done and added, "And here I am now going in to them to slay
them in the foulest way and make of them the most shameful of
examples." Quoth King Armanus (and indeed he too was wroth
with them), "Thou dost well, O my son, and may Allah not bless
them nor any sons that do such deed against their father's honour.
But, O my son, the sayer of the old saw saith:—Whoso looketh not
to the end hath not Fortune to friend. In any case, they are thy
sons, and it befitteth not that thou kill them with thine own hand,
lest thou drink of their death-agony,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1595" id="noteref-1595" epub:type="noteref">1595</a> and anon repent of having
slain them whenas repentance availeth thee naught. Rather do
thou send them with one of thy Mamelukes into the desert and
let him kill them there out of thy sight, for, as saith the adage:—Out
of sight of my friend is better and pleasanter."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1596" id="noteref-1596" epub:type="noteref">1596</a> And when
Kamar al-Zaman heard his father-in-law's words, he knew them to
be just; so he sheathed his sword and turning back, sat down upon
the throne of his realm. There he summoned his treasurer, a very
old man, versed in affairs and in fortune's vicissitudes, to whom
he said, "Go in to my sons, Amjad and As'ad; bind their hands
behind them with strong bonds, lay them in two chests and load
them upon a mule. Then take horse thou and carry them into
mid-desert, where do thou kill them both and fill two vials with
their blood and bring the same to me in haste." Replied the
treasurer, "I hear and I obey," and he rose up hurriedly and went
out forthright to seek the Princes; and, on his road, he met them
coming out of the palace-vestibule, for they had donned their best
clothes and their richest; and they were on their way to salute
their sire and give him joy of his safe return from his going
forth to hunt. Now when he saw them, he laid hands on them,
saying, "O my sons, know ye that I am but a slave commanded,
and that your father hath laid a commandment on me; will ye
obey his commandment?" They said, "Yes"; whereupon he
went up to them and, after pinioning their arms, laid them in the
chests which he loaded on the back of a mule he had taken from
the city. And he ceased not carrying them into the open country
till near noon, when he halted in a waste and desolate place and,
dismounting from his mare, let down the two chests from the
mule's back. Then he opened them and took out Amjad and
As'ad; and when he looked upon them he wept sore for their
beauty and loveliness; then drawing his sword he said to them,
"By Allah, O my lords, indeed it is hard for me to deal so evilly
by you; but I am to be excused in this matter, being but a slave
commanded, for that your father King Kamar al-Zaman hath
bidden me strike off your heads." They replied, "O Emir, do the
King's bidding, for we bear with patience that which Allah (to
Whom be Honour, Might and Glory!) hath decreed to us; and
thou art quit of our blood." Then they embraced and bade each
other farewell, and As'ad said to the treasurer, "Allah upon thee,
O uncle, spare me the sight of my brother's death-agony and
make me not drink of his anguish, but kill me first, for that were
the easier for me." And Amjad said the like and entreated the
treasurer to kill him before As'ad, saying, "My brother is younger
than I; so make me not taste of his anguish." And they both
wept bitter tears whilst the treasurer wept for their weeping;——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the treasurer
wept for their weeping; then the two brothers embraced and bade
farewell and one said to the other, "All this cometh of the malice
of those <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">traitresses</span>, my mother and thy mother; and this is the
reward of my forbearance towards thy mother and of thy forbearance
towards my mother! But there is no Might and there

are Allah's and unto Him we are returning."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1597" id="noteref-1597" epub:type="noteref">1597</a> And As'ad embraced
his brother, sobbing and repeating these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Thou to whom sad trembling wights in fear complain! ✿ O ever ready whatso cometh to sustain!</div>

      <div class="line">O Thou whose grace is treasured in the one word, Be!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1598" id="noteref-1598" epub:type="noteref">1598</a> ✿ Favour me, I beseech, in Thee all weals contain.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when Amjad heard his brother's weeping he wept also
and pressing him to his bosom repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O Thou whose boons to me are more than one! ✿ Whose gifts and favours have nor count nor bound!</div>
      <div class="line">No stroke of all Fate's strokes e'er fell on me, ✿ But Thee to take me by the hand I found.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then said Amjad to the treasurer, "I conjure thee by the One,
Omnipotent, the Lord of Mercy, the Beneficent! slay me before
my brother As'ad, so haply shall the fire be quencht in my heart's
core and in this life burn no more." But As'ad wept and exclaimed,
"Not so: I will die first;" whereupon quoth Amjad, "It
were best that I embrace thee and thou embrace me, so the sword
may fall upon us and slay us both at a single stroke." Thereupon
they embraced, face to face and clung to each other straitly, whilst
the treasurer tied up the twain and bound them fast with cords,
weeping the while. Then he drew his blade and said to them, "By
Allah, O my lords, it is indeed hard to me to slay you! But have
ye no last wishes that I may fulfil or charges which I may carry
out, or message which I may deliver?" Replied Amjad, "We have
no wish; and my only charge to thee is that thou set my brother below
and me above him, that the blow may fall on me first; and when
thou hast killed us and returnest to the King and he asketh thee:—What
heardest thou from them before their death?; do thou
answer:—Verily thy sons salute thee and say to thee, Thou
knewest not if we were innocent or guilty, yet hast thou put us to
death and hast not certified thyself of our sin nor looked into our
case. Then do thou repeat to him these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Women are Satans made for woe o' men; ✿ I fly to Allah from their devilish scathe:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Continued Amjad, "We desire of thee naught but that thou repeat
to our sire these two couplets"——And Shahrazad perceived
the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me O auspicious King, that Amjad
added, speaking to the treasurer, "We desire of thee naught but
that thou repeat to our sire these two couplets which thou hast just
now heard; and I conjure thee by Allah to have patience with us,
whilst I cite to my brother this other pair of couplets." Then he
wept with sore weeping and began:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"The Kings who fared before us showed ✿ Of instances full many a show:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when the treasurer heard these words from Amjad, he wept
till his beard was wet, whilst As'ad's eyes brimmed with tears and
he in turn repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Fate frights us when the thing is past and gone; ✿ Weeping is not for form or face alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1599" id="noteref-1599" epub:type="noteref">1599</a>:</div>
      <div class="line">What ails the Nights?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1600" id="noteref-1600" epub:type="noteref">1600</a> Allah blot out our sin, ✿ And be the Nights by other hand undone!</div>
      <div class="line">Ere this Zubayr-son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1601" id="noteref-1601" epub:type="noteref">1601</a> felt their spiteful hate, ✿ Who fled for refuge to the House and Stone:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, with cheeks stained by tears down railing he recited also
these verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">In sooth the Nights and Days are charactered ✿ By traitor falsehood and as knaves they lie;</div>

      <div class="line">My sin anent the world which I abhor ✿ Is sin of sword when sworders fighting hie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then his sobs waxed louder and he said:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O thou who woost a World<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1604" id="noteref-1604" epub:type="noteref">1604</a> unworthy, learn ✿ 'Tis house of evils, 'tis Perdition's net:</div>

      <div class="line">And cut all chains of world-love and desire ✿ And save thy soul and rise to secrets higher.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Now when As'ad made an end of these verses, he strained his
brother Amjad in his arms, till they twain were one body, and the
treasurer, drawing his sword, was about to strike them, when
behold, his steed took fright at the wind of his upraised hand, and
breaking its tether, fled into the desert. Now the horse had cost
a thousand gold pieces and on its back was a splendid saddle worth
much money; so the treasurer threw down his sword, and ran after
his beast.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say,</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when his
horse ran away, the treasurer ran after it in huge concern, and
ceased not running to catch the runaway till it entered a thicket.
He followed it whilst it dashed through the wood, smiting the
earth with its hoofs till it raised a dust-cloud which towered high
in air; and snorting and puffing and neighing and waxing fierce
and furious. Now there happened to be in this thicket a lion of
terrible might; hideous to sight, with eyes sparkling light: his
look was grim and his aspect struck fright into man's sprite. Presently
the treasurer turned and saw the lion making towards him;
but found no way of escape nor had he his sword with him. So
he said in himself, "There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This strait is come upon
me for no other cause but because of Amjad and As'ad; and
indeed this journey was unblest from the first!" Meanwhile the
two Princes were grievously oppressed by the heat and grew sore
athirst, so that their tongues hung out and they cried for succour,
but none came to their relief and they said, "Would to Heaven we
had been slain and were at peace from this pain! But we know not
whither the horse hath fled, that the treasurer is gone and hath left
us thus pinioned. If he would but come back and do us die, it were
easier to us than this torture to aby." Said As'ad, "O my brother,
be patient, and the relief of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!)
shall assuredly come to us; for the horse started not away save of
His favour towards us, and naught irketh us but this thirst." Upon
this he stretched and shook himself and strained right and left, till
he burst his pinion-bonds; then he rose and unbound his brother
and catching up the Emir's sword, said, "By Allah, we will not go
hence, till we look after him and learn what is become of him."
Then they took to following on the trail till it led them to the
thicket and they said to each other, "Of a surety, the horse and
the treasurer have not passed out of this wood." Quoth As'ad,
"Stay thou here, whilst I enter the thicket and search it;" and
Amjad replied, "I will not let thee go in alone: nor will we enter
it but together; so if we escape, we shall escape together and if
we perish, we shall perish together." Accordingly both entered and
found that the lion had sprang upon the treasurer, who lay like a
sparrow in his grip, calling upon Allah for aid and signing with his
hands to Heaven. Now when Amjad saw this, he took the sword
and, rushing upon the lion, smote him between the eyes and laid
him dead on the ground. The Emir sprang up, marvelling at this
escape and seeing Amjad and As'ad, his master's sons, standing
there, cast himself at their feet and exclaimed, "By Allah, O my
lords, it were intolerable wrong in me to do you to death. May
the man never be who would kill you! Indeed, with my very
life, I will ransom you"——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth the
treasurer to Amjad and As'ad, "With my life will I ransom you
both!" Then he hastily rose and, at once embracing them, enquired
how they had loosed their bonds and come thither; whereupon
they told him how the bonds of one of them had fallen loose
and he had unbound the other, whereto they were helped by the
purity of their intentions, and how they had tracked his trail till
they came upon him. So he thanked them for their deed and went
with them forth of the thicket; and, when they were in the open
country, they said to him, "O uncle, do our father's bidding." He
replied, "Allah forbid that I should draw near to you with hurt!
But know ye that I mean to take your clothes and clothe you
with mine; then will I fill two vials with the lion's blood and go
back to the King and tell him I have put you to death. But as
for you two, fare ye forth into the lands, for Allah's earth is wide;
and know, O my lords, that it paineth me to part from you." At
this, they all fell a-weeping; then the two youths put off their
clothes and the treasurer habited them with his own. Moreover he
made two parcels of their dress and, filling two vials with the lion's
blood, set the parcels before him on his horse's back. Presently he
took leave of them and, making his way to the city, ceased not
faring till he went in to King Kamar al-Zaman and kissed the
ground between his hands. The King saw him changed in face
and troubled (which arose from his adventure with the lion) and,
deeming this came of the slaughter of his two sons, rejoiced and
said to him, "Hast thou done the work?" "Yes, O our lord,"
replied the treasurer and gave him the two parcels of clothes and
the two vials full of blood. Asked the King, "What didst thou
observe in them; and did they give thee any charge?" Answered
the treasurer, "I found them patient and resigned to what came
down upon them and they said to me:—Verily, our father is excusable;
bear him our salutation and say to him, Thou art quit
of our killing. But we charge thee repeat to him these couplets:—</p>

    </div>
  </div>

<p>When the King heard these words of the treasurer, he bowed his
head earthwards, a long while and knew his sons' words to mean
that they had been wrongfully put to death. Then he bethought
himself of the perfidy of women and the calamities brought about
by them; and he took the two parcels and opened them and fell
to turning over his sons' clothes and weeping,——And Shahrazad

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King
Kamar al-Zaman opened the two bundles and fell to turning over
his sons' clothes and weeping, it so came to pass that he found, in
the pocket of his son As'ad's raiment, a letter in the hand of his
wife enclosing her hair-strings; so he opened and read it and understanding
the contents knew that the Prince had been falsely
accused and wrongously. Then he searched Amjad's parcel of
dress and found in his pocket a letter in the handwriting of Queen
Hayat al-Nufus enclosing also her hair-strings; so he opened and
read it and knew that Amjad too had been wronged; whereupon
he beat hand upon hand and exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and
there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! I have
slain my sons unjustly." And he buffeted his face, crying out,
"Alas, my sons! Alas, my long grief!" Then he bade them
build two tombs in one house, which he styled "House of Lamentations,"
and had graved thereon his sons' names; and he threw
himself on Amjad's tomb, weeping and groaning and lamenting,
and improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">O moon for ever set this earth below, ✿ Whose loss bewail the stars which stud the sky!</div>
      <div class="line">O wand, which broken, ne'er with bend and wave ✿ Shall fascinate the ravisht gazer's eye;</div>
      <div class="line">These eyne for jealousy I 'reft of thee, ✿ Nor shall they till next life thy sight descry:</div>
      <div class="line">I'm drowned in sea of tears for insomny ✿ Wherefore, indeed in Sáhirah-stead<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1607" id="noteref-1607" epub:type="noteref">1607</a> I lie.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then he threw himself on As'ad's tomb, groaning and weeping
and lamenting and versifying with these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Indeed I longed to share unweal with thee, ✿ But Allah than my will willed otherwise:</div>
      <div class="line">My grief all blackens 'twixt mine eyes and space, ✿ Yet whitens all the blackness from mine eyes:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1608" id="noteref-1608" epub:type="noteref">1608</a></div>
      <div class="line">Of tears they weep these eyne run never dry, ✿ And ulcerous flow in vitals never dries:</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And his weeping and wailing redoubled; and, after he had ended
his lamentations and his verse, he forsook his friends and intimates,
and denying himself to his women and his family, cut himself off
from the world in the House of Lamentations, where he passed his
time in weeping for his sons. Such was his case; but as regards
Amjad and As'ad they fared on into the desert eating of the fruits
of the earth and drinking of the remnants of the rain for a full
month, till their travel brought them to a mountain of black flint<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1610" id="noteref-1610" epub:type="noteref">1610</a>
whose further end was unknown; and here the road forked, one
line lying along the midway height and the other leading to its
head. They took the way trending to the top and gave not over
following it five days, but saw no end to it and were overcome
with weariness, being unused to walking upon the mountains or
elsewhere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1611" id="noteref-1611" epub:type="noteref">1611</a> At last, despairing of coming to the last of the road,
they retraced their steps and, taking the other, that led over the
midway heights,——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princes
Amjad and As'ad returned from the path leading to the Mountain-head
and took that which ran along the midway heights, and
walked through all that day till nightfall, when As'ad, weary with
much travel, said to Amjad, "O my brother, I can walk no farther,
for I am exceeding weak." Replied Amjad, "O my brother, take
courage! May be Allah will send us relief." So they walked on
part of the night, till the darkness closed in upon them, when
As'ad became weary beyond measure of weariness and cried out,
"O my brother, I am worn out and spent with walking," and threw
himself upon the ground and wept. Amjad took him in his arms
and walked on with him, bytimes sitting down to rest till break of
day, when they came to the mountain-top and found there a stream
of running water and by it a pomegranate-tree and a prayer-niche.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1612" id="noteref-1612" epub:type="noteref">1612</a>
They could hardly believe their eyes when they saw it; but, sitting
down by that spring, drank of its water and ate of the fruit of that
granado-tree; after which they lay on the ground and slept till sunrise,
when they washed and bathed in the spring and, eating of the
pomegranates, slept again till the time of mid-afternoon prayer.
Then they thought to continue their journey, but As'ad could not
walk, for both his feet were swollen. So they abode there three
days till they were rested, after which they set out again and fared
on over the mountain days and nights, tortured by and like to die
of thirst, till they sighted a city gleaming afar off, at which they
rejoiced and made towards it. When they drew near it, they
thanked Allah (be His Name exalted!) and Amjad said to As'ad,
"O my brother, sit here, whilst I go to yonder city and see what
it is and whose it is and where we are in Allah's wide world, that
we may know through what lands we have passed in crossing this
mountain, whose skirts had we followed, we had not reached this
city in a whole year. So praised be Allah for safety!" Replied
As'ad, "By Allah, O my brother, none shall go down into that city
save myself, and may I be thy ransom! If thou leave me alone,
be it only for an hour, I shall imagine a thousand things and be
drowned in a torrent of anxiety on thine account, for I cannot
brook thine absence from me." Amjad rejoined, "Go then and
tarry not." So As'ad took some gold pieces, and leaving his brother
to await him, descended the mountain and ceased not faring on till
he entered the city. As he threaded the streets he was met by an
old man age-decrepit, whose beard flowed down upon his breast
and forked in twain;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1613" id="noteref-1613" epub:type="noteref">1613</a> he bore a walking-staff in his hand and was
richly clad, with a great red turband on his head. When As'ad
saw him, he wondered at his dress and his mien; nevertheless, he
went up to him and saluting him said, "Where be the way to
the market, O my master?" Hearing these words the Shaykh
smiled in his face and replied, "O my son, meseemeth thou art a
stranger?" As'ad rejoined, "Yes, I am a stranger."——And Shahrazad
perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div></div>
<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Shaykh
who met As'ad smiled in his face and said to him, "O my son,
meseemeth thou art a stranger?" and As'ad replied, "Yes, I am a
stranger." Then rejoined the old man, "Verily, thou gladdenest
our country with thy presence, O my son, and thou desolatest
thine own land by reason of thine absence. What wantest thou
of the market?" Quoth As'ad, "O uncle, I have a brother, with
whom I have come from a far land and with whom I have
journeyed these three months; and, when we sighted this city,
I left him, who is my elder brother, upon the mountain and came
hither, purposing to buy victual and what else, and return therewith
to him, that we might feed thereon." Said the old man,
"Rejoice in all good, O my son, and know thou that to-day I
give a marriage-feast, to which I have bidden many guests, and
I have made ready plenty of meats, the best and most delicious
that heart can desire. So if thou wilt come with me to my place,
I will give thee freely all thou lackest without asking thee a price
or aught else. Moreover I will teach thee the ways of this city;
and, praised be Allah, O my son, that I, and none other have
happened upon thee." "As thou wilt," answered As'ad, "do as
thou art disposed, but make haste, for indeed my brother awaiteth
me and his whole heart is with me." The old man took As'ad by
the hand and carried him to a narrow lane, smiling in his face
and saying, "Glory be to Him who hath delivered thee from the
people of this city!" And he ceased not walking till he entered
a spacious house, wherein was a saloon and behold, in the middle
of it were forty old men, well stricken in years, collected together
and forming a single ring as they sat round about a lighted fire,
to which they were doing worship and prostrating themselves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1614" id="noteref-1614" epub:type="noteref">1614</a>
When As'ad saw this, he was confounded and the hair of his
body stood on end though he knew not what they were; and the
Shaykh said to them, "O Elders of the Fire, how blessed is this
day!" Then he called aloud, saying, "Hallo, Ghazbán!" Whereupon
there came out to him a tall black slave of frightful aspect,
grim-visaged and flat nosed as an ape who, when the old man
made a sign to him, bent As'ad's arms behind his back and
pinioned them; after which the Shaykh said to him, "Let him
down into the vault under the earth and there leave him and say
to my slave-girl Such-an-one:—Torture him night and day and
give him a cake of bread to eat morning and evening against the
time come of the voyage to the Blue Sea and the Mountain of
Fire, whereon we will slaughter him as a sacrifice." So the black
carried him out at another door and, raising a flag in the floor,
discovered a flight of twenty steps leading to a chamber<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1615" id="noteref-1615" epub:type="noteref">1615</a> under
the earth, into which he descended with him and, laying his feet
in irons, gave him over to the slave-girl and went away. Meanwhile,
the old men said to one another, "When the day of the
Festival of the Fire cometh, we will sacrifice him on the mountain,
as a propitiatory offering whereby we shall pleasure the Fire."
Presently the damsel went down to him and beat him a grievous
beating, till streams of blood flowed from his sides and he fainted;
after which she set at his head a scone of bread and a cruse of
brackish water and went away and left him. In the middle of the
night, he revived and found himself bound and beaten and sore
with beating: so he wept bitter tears; and recalling his former
condition of honour and prosperity, lordship and dominion, and
his separation from his sire and his exile from his native land——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>

    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-eight Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when As'ad
found himself bound and beaten and sore with beating he recalled
his whilome condition of honour and prosperity and dominion
and lordship, and he wept and groaned aloud and recited these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Stand by the ruined stead and ask of us; ✿ Nor deem we dwell there as was state of us:</div>
      <div class="line">The World, that parter, hath departed us; ✿ Yet soothes not hate-full hearts the fate of us:</div>
      <div class="line">With whips a cursèd slave-girl scourges us, ✿ And teems her breast with rancorous hate of us:</div>
      <div class="line">Allah shall haply deign to unpart our lives, ✿ Chastise our foes, and end this strait of us.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when As'ad had spoken his poetry, he put out his hand
towards his head and finding there the crust and the cruse full of
brackish water he ate a bittock, just enough to keep life in him, and
drank a little water, but could get no sleep till morning for the
swarms of bugs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1616" id="noteref-1616" epub:type="noteref">1616</a> and lice. As soon as it was day, the slave-girl
came down to him and changed his clothes, which were drenched
with blood and stuck to him, so that his skin came off with the
shirt; wherefor he shrieked aloud and cried, "Alas!" and said,
"O my God, if this be Thy pleasure, increase it upon me! O
Lord, verily Thou art not unmindful of him that oppresseth me; do
Thou then avenge me upon him!" And he groaned and repeated
the following verses:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Patient, O Allah! to Thy destiny ✿ I bow, suffice me what Thou deign decree:</div>
      <div class="line">Patient to bear Thy will, O Lord of me, ✿ Patient to burn on coals of Ghazátree:</div>
      <div class="line">They wrong me, visit me with hurt and harm; ✿ Haply Thy grace from them shall set me free:</div>
      <div class="line">Far be't, O Lord, from thee to spare the wronger ✿ O Lord of Destiny my hope's in Thee!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And what another saith:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Bethink thee not of worldly state, ✿ Leave everything to course of Fate;</div>
      <div class="line">For oft a thing that irketh thee ✿ Shall in content eventuate;</div>
      <div class="line">And oft what strait is shall expand, ✿ And what expanded is wax strait.</div>

      <div class="line">But 'joy the view of coming weal ✿ Shall make forget past bale and bate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he had ended his verse, the slave-girl came down upon
him with blows till he fainted again; and, throwing him a flap of
bread and a gugglet of saltish water, went away and left him sad
and lonely, bound in chains of iron, with the blood streaming
from his sides and far from those he loved. So he wept and called
to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted
say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that As'ad called
to mind his brother and the honours he erst enjoyed; so he wept
and groaned and complained and poured forth tears in floods and
improvised these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Easy, O Fate! how long this wrong, this injury, ✿ Robbing each morn and eve my brotherhood fro' me?</div>
      <div class="line">Is't not time now thou deem this length sufficiency ✿ Of woes and, O thou Heart of Rock, show clemency?</div>
      <div class="line">My friends thou wrongedst when thou madst each enemy ✿ Mock and exult me for thy wrongs, thy tyranny:</div>
      <div class="line">My foeman's heart is solaced by the things he saw ✿ In me, of strangerhood and lonely misery:</div>
      <div class="line">Suffice thee not what came upon my head of dole, ✿ Friends lost for evermore, eyes wan and pale of blee?</div>
      <div class="line">But must in prison cast so narrow there is naught ✿ Save hand to bite, with bitten hand for company;</div>
      <div class="line">And tears that tempest down like goodly gift of cloud, ✿ And longing thirst whose fires weet no satiety.</div>
      <div class="line">Regretful yearnings, singulfs and unceasing sighs, ✿ Repine, remembrance and pain's very ecstacy:</div>
      <div class="line">Desire I suffer sore and melancholy deep, ✿ And I must bide a prey to endless <span lang="la" xml:lang="la" xml:lang="la">phrenesy</span>:</div>
      <div class="line">I find me ne'er a friend who looks with piteous eye, ✿ And seeks my presence to allay my misery:</div>
      <div class="line">Say, liveth any intimate with trusty love ✿ Who for mine ills will groan, my sleepless malady?</div>
      <div class="line">To whom moan I can make and, peradventure, he ✿ Shall pity eyes that sight of sleep can never see?</div>
      <div class="line">The flea and bug suck up my blood, as wight that drinks ✿ Wine from the proffering hand of fair virginity:</div>
      <div class="line">Amid the lice my body aye remindeth me ✿ Of orphan's good in Kázi's claw of villainy:</div>
      <div class="line">My home's a sepulchre that measures cubits three, ✿ Where pass I morn and eve in chainèd agony:</div>
      <div class="line">My wines are tears, my clank of chains takes music's stead; ✿ Cares my dessert of fruit and sorrows are my bed.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And when he had versed his verse and had prosed his prose, he
again groaned and complained and remembered what he had been
and how he had been parted from his brother. Thus far concerning
him; but as regards his brother Amjad, he awaited As'ad
till mid-day yet he returned not to him: whereupon Amjad's
vitals fluttered, the pangs of parting were sore upon him and he
poured forth abundant tears,——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirtieth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Amjad awaited his brother As'ad till mid-day and he returned not
to him, Amjad's vitals fluttered; the pangs of parting were sore
upon him and he poured forth abundant tears, exclaiming, "Alas,
my brother! Alas, my friend! Alas my grief! How I feared
me we should be separated!" Then he descended from the
mountain-top with the tears running down his cheeks; and,
entering the city, ceased not walking till he made the market.
He asked the folk the name of the place and concerning its
people and they said, "This is called the City of the Magians,
and its citizens are mostly given to Fire-worshipping in lieu
of the Omnipotent King." Then he enquired of the City of
Ebony and they answered, "Of a truth it is a year's journey
thither by land and six months by sea: it was governed erst by
a King called Armanus; but he took to son-in-law and made
King in his stead a Prince called Kamar al-Zaman distinguished
for justice and munificence, equity and benevolence." When
Amjad heard tell of his father, he groaned and wept and lamented
and knew not whither to go. However, he bought a something of
food and carried it to a retired spot where he sat down thinking
to eat; but, recalling his brother, he fell a-weeping and swallowed
but a morsel to keep breath and body together, and that against
his will. Then he rose and walked about the city, seeking news
of his brother, till he saw a Moslem tailor sitting in his shop;
so he sat down by him and told him his story; whereupon
quoth the tailor, "If he have fallen into the hands of the
Magians, thou shalt hardly see him again: yet it may be Allah
will reunite you twain. But thou, O my brother," he continued,
"wilt thou lodge with me?" Amjad answered, "Yes"; and the
tailor rejoiced at this. So he abode with him many days, what
while the tailor comforted him and exhorted him to patience and
taught him tailoring, till he became expert in the craft. Now one
day he went forth to the sea-shore and washed his clothes; after
which he entered the bath and put on clean raiment; then he
walked about the city, to divert himself with its sights and
presently there met him on the way a woman of passing beauty
and loveliness, without peer for grace and comeliness. When she
saw him she raised her face-veil and signed to him by moving her
eyebrows and her eyes with luring glances, and versified these
couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">I drooped my glance when seen thee on the way ✿ As though, O slim-waist! felled by Sol's hot ray:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou art the fairest fair that e'er appeared, ✿ Fairer to-day than fair of yesterday:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1617" id="noteref-1617" epub:type="noteref">1617</a></div>
      <div class="line">Were Beauty parted, a fifth part of it ✿ With Joseph or a part of fifth would stay;</div>
      <div class="line">The rest would fly to thee, thine ownest own; ✿ Be every soul thy sacrifice, I pray!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Amjad heard these her words, they gladdened his heart
which inclined to her and his bowels yearned towards her and
the hands of love sported with him; so he sighed to her in reply
and spoke these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Above the rose of cheek is thorn of lance;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1618" id="noteref-1618" epub:type="noteref">1618</a> ✿ Who dareth pluck it, rashest <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevisance</span>?</div>
      <div class="line">Stretch not thy hand towards it, for night long ✿ Those lances marred because we snatched a glance!</div>
      <div class="line">Say her, who tyrant is and tempter too ✿ (Though justice might her tempting power enhance):—</div>
      <div class="line">Thy face would add to errors were it veiled; ✿ Unveiled I see its guard hath best of chance!</div>
      <div class="line">Eye cannot look upon Sol's naked face; ✿ But can, when mist-cloud dims his countenance:</div>
      <div class="line">The honey-hive is held by honey-bee;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1619" id="noteref-1619" epub:type="noteref">1619</a> ✿ Ask the tribe-guards what wants their vigilance?</div>
      <div class="line">An they would slay me, let them end their ire ✿ Rancorous, and grant us freely to advance:</div>
      <div class="line">They're not more murderous, an charge the whole ✿ Than charging glance of her who wears the mole.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And hearing these lines from Amjad she sighed with the deepest
sighs and, signing to him again, repeated these couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">'Tis thou hast trodden coyness-path not I: ✿ Grant me thy favours for the time draws nigh:</div>
      <div class="line">O thou who makest morn with light of brow, ✿ And with loosed brow-locks night in lift to stye!</div>
      <div class="line">Thine idol-aspect made of me thy slave, ✿ Tempting as temptedst me in days gone by:</div>
      <div class="line">'Tis just my liver fry with hottest love: ✿ Who worship fire for God must fire aby:</div>
      <div class="line">Thou sellest like of me for worthless price; ✿ If thou must sell, ask high of those who buy.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>When Amjad heard these her words he said to her, "Wilt thou
come to my lodging or shall I go with thee to thine?" So she
hung her head in shame to the ground and repeated the words of
Him whose Name be exalted, "Men shall have the pre-eminence
above women, because of those advantages wherein Allah hath
caused the one of them to excel the other."<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1620" id="noteref-1620" epub:type="noteref">1620</a> Upon this, Amjad
took the hint——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-first Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Amjad took
the woman's hint and understood that she wished to go with him
whither he was going; he felt himself bounden to find a place
wherein to receive her, but was ashamed to carry her to the house
of his host, the tailor. So he walked on and she walked after him,
and the two ceased not walking from street to street and place to
place, till she was tired and said to him, "O my lord, where is thy
house?" Answered he, "Before us a little way." Then he turned
aside into a handsome by-street, followed by the young woman,
and walked on till he came to the end, when he found it was no
thoroughfare and exclaimed, "There is no Majesty and there is no
Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!" Then raising his
eyes, he saw, at the upper end of the lane a great door with two
stone benches; but it was locked. So Amjad sat down on one of
the benches and she on the other; and she said to him, "O my
lord, wherefore waitest thou?" He bowed his head awhile to the
ground then raised it and answered, "I am awaiting my Mameluke
who hath the key; for I bade him make me ready meat and drink
and flowers, to deck the wine-service against my return from the
bath." But he said to himself, "Haply the time will be tedious
to her and she will go about her business, leaving me here, when
I will wend my own way." However, as soon as she was weary
of long waiting, she said, "O my lord, thy Mameluke delayeth;
and here are we sitting in the street;" and she arose and took a
stone and went up to the lock. Said Amjad, "Be not in haste,
but have patience till the servant come." However, she hearkened
not to him, but smote the wooden bolt with the stone and broke
it in half, whereupon the door opened. Quoth he, "What possessed
thee to do this deed?" Quoth she, "Pooh, pooh, my lord!
what matter it? Is not the house thy house and thy place?" He
said, "There was no need to break the bolt." Then the damsel
entered, to the confusion of Amjad, who knew not what to do for
fear of the people of the house; but she said to him, "Why dost
thou not enter, O light of mine eyes and core of my heart?"
Replied he, "I hear and obey; but my servant tarrieth long and
I know not if he have done aught of what I bade him and
specially enjoined upon him, or not." Hereupon he entered, sore
in fear of the people of the house, and found himself in a handsome
saloon with four daïs'd recesses, each facing other, and containing
closets and raised seats, all bespread with stuffs of silk
and brocade; and in the midst was a jetting fountain of costly
fashion, on whose margin rested a covered tray of meats, with
a leather tablecloth hanging up and gem-encrusted dishes, full of
fruits and sweet-scented flowers. Hard by stood drinking vessels
and a candlestick with a single wax-candle therein; and the
place was full of precious stuffs and was ranged with chests and
stools, and on each seat lay a parcel of clothes upon which was a
purse full of monies, gold and silver. The floor was paved with
marble and the house bore witness in every part to its owner's
fortune. When Amjad saw all this, he was confounded at his case
and said to himself, "I am a lost man! Verily we are Allah's
and to Allah we are returning!" As for the damsel, when she
sighted the place she rejoiced indeed with a joy nothing could
exceed, and said to him, "By Allah, O my lord, thy servant hath
not failed of his duty; for see, he hath swept the place and
cooked the meat and set on the fruit; and indeed I come at the
best of times." But he paid no heed to her, his heart being taken
up with fear of the house-folk; and she said, "Fie, O my lord, O
my heart! What aileth thee to stand thus?" Then she sighed;
and, giving him a buss which sounded like the cracking of a
walnut, said, "O my lord, an thou have made an appointment
with other than with me, I will gird my middle and serve her and
thee." Amjad laughed from a heart full of rage and wrath and
came forwards and sat down, panting and saying to himself,
"Alack, mine ill death and doom when the owner of the place
shall return!" Then she seated herself by him and fell to
toying and laughing, whilst Amjad sat careful and frowning,
thinking a thousand thoughts and communing with himself,
"Assuredly the master of the house cannot but come, and then
what shall I say to him? he needs must kill me and my life will
be lost thus foolishly." Presently she rose and, tucking up her
sleeves, took a tray of food on which she laid the cloth and then
set it before Amjad and began to eat, saying, "Eat, O my lord."
So he came forward and ate; but the food was not pleasant to
him; on the contrary he ceased not to look towards the door, till
the damsel had eaten her fill, when she took away the tray of the
meats and, setting on the dessert, fell to eating of the dried fruits.
Then she brought the wine-service and opening the jar, filled a cup
and handed it to Amjad, who took it from her hand saying to himself,
"Ah, ah! and well-away, when the master of the house cometh
and seeth me!"; and he kept his eyes fixed on the threshold,
even with cup in hand. While he was in this case, lo! in came
the master of the house, who was a white slave, one of the chief
men of the city, being Master of the Horse<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1621" id="noteref-1621" epub:type="noteref">1621</a> to the King. He had
fitted up this saloon for his pleasures, that he might make merry
therein and be private with whom he would, and he had that day
bidden a youth whom he loved and had made this entertainment
for him. Now the name of this slave was Bahádur,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1622" id="noteref-1622" epub:type="noteref">1622</a> and he was
open of hand, generous, munificent and fain of alms-giving and
charitable works.——And Shahzarad perceived the dawn of day
and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-second Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Bahadur, the Master of the Horse and the owner of the house,
came to the door of the saloon and found it open, he entered
slowly and softly and looking in, with head advanced and outstretched
neck, saw Amjad and the girl sitting before the dish of
fruit and the wine-jar in front of them. Now Amjad at that
moment had the cup in his hand and his face turned to the door;
and when his glance met Bahadur's eyes his hue turned pale yellow
and his side-muscles quivered, so seeing his trouble Bahadur signed
to him with his finger on his lips, as much as to say, "Be silent
and come hither to me." Whereupon he set down the cup and
rose and the damsel cried, "Whither away?" He shook his head
and, signing to her that he wished to make water, went out into
the passage barefoot. Now when he saw Bahadur he knew him
for the master of the house; so he hastened to him and, kissing
his hands, said to him, "Allah upon thee, O my lord, ere thou do
me a hurt, hear what I have to say." Then he told him who he
was from first to last and acquainted him with what caused him to
quit his native land and royal state, and how he had not entered
his house of his free will, but that it was the girl who had broken
the lock-bolt and done all this.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1623" id="noteref-1623" epub:type="noteref">1623</a> When Bahadur heard his story
and knew that he was a King's son, he felt for him and, taking
compassion on him, said, "Hearken to me, O Amjad, and do what
I bid thee and I will guarantee thy safety from that thou fearest;
but, if thou cross me, I will kill thee." Amjad replied, "Command
me as thou wilt: I will not gainsay thee in aught; no, never, for
I am the freedman of thy bounty." Rejoined Bahadur, "Then go
back forthwith into the saloon, sit down in thy place and be at
peace and at thine ease; I will presently come in to thee, and
when thou seest me (remember my name is Bahadur) do thou
revile me and rail at me, saying:—What made thee tarry till so
late? And accept no excuse from me; nay, so far from it, rise
and beat me; and, if thou spare me, I will do away thy life.
Enter now and make merry and whatsoever thou seekest of me at
this time I will bring thee forthwith; and do thou spend this
night as thou wilt and on the morrow wend thy way. This I do
in honour of thy strangerhood, for I love the stranger and hold
myself bounden to do him <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">devoir</span>." So Amjad kissed his hand,
and, returning to the saloon with his face clad in its natural white
and red, at once said to the damsel, "O my mistress, thy presence
hath gladdened this thine own place and ours is indeed a blessed
night." Quoth the girl, "Verily I see a wonderful change in thee,
that thou now welcomest me so cordially!" So Amjad answered,
"By Allah, O my lady, methought my servant Bahadur had robbed
me of some necklaces of jewels, worth ten thousand dinars each;
however, when I went out but now in concern for this, I sought for
them and found them in their place. I know not why the slave
tarrieth so long and needs must I punish him for it." She was
satisfied with his answer, and they sported and drank and made
merry and ceased not to be so till near sundown, when Bahadur
came in to them, having changed his clothes and girt his middle
and put on shoes, such as are worn of Mamelukes. He saluted
and kissed the ground; then held his hands behind him and stood,
with his head hanging down, as one who confesseth to a fault. So
Amjad looked at him with angry eyes and asked, "Why hast thou
tarried till now, O most pestilent of slaves?" Answered Bahadur,
"O my lord, I was busy washing my clothes and knew not of thy
being here; for our appointed time was nightfall and not day-tide."
But Amjad cried out at him, saying, "Thou liest, O vilest
of slaves! By Allah, I must needs beat thee." So he rose and,
throwing Bahadur prone on the ground, took a stick and beat him
gently; but the damsel sprang up and, snatching the stick from
his hand, came down upon Bahadur so lustily, that in extreme
pain the tears ran from his eyes and he ground his teeth together
and called out for succour; whilst Amjad cried out to the girl
"Don't"; and she cried out, "Let me satisfy my anger upon
him!" till at last he pulled the stick out of her hand and
pushed her away. So Bahadur rose and, wiping away his tears
from his cheeks, waited upon them the while; after which he
swept the hall and lighted the lamps; but as often as he went
in and out, the lady abused him and cursed him till Amjad was
wroth with her and said, "For Almighty Allah's sake leave my
Mameluke; he is not used to this." Then they sat and ceased
not eating and drinking (and Bahadur waiting upon them) till
midnight when, being weary with service and beating, he fell
asleep in the midst of the hall and snored and snorted; whereupon
the damsel, who was drunken with wine, said to Amjad,
"Arise, take the sword hanging yonder and cut me off this slave's
head; and, if thou do it not, I will be the death of thee!" "What
possesseth thee to slay my slave?" asked Amjad; and she answered,
"Our joyaunce will not be complete but by his death. If
thou wilt not kill him, I will do it myself." Quoth Amjad, "By
Allah's rights to thee, do not this thing!" Quoth she, "It must
perforce be;" and, taking down the sword, drew it and made at
Badahur to kill him; but Amjad said in his mind, "This man hath
entreated us courteously and sheltered us and done us kindness and
made himself my slave: shall we requite him by slaughtering him?
This shall never be!" Then he said to the woman, "If my Mameluke
must be killed, better I should kill him than thou." So saying, he
took the sword from her and, raising his hand, smote her on the
neck and made her head fly from her body. It fell upon Bahadur
who awoke and sat up and opened his eyes, when he saw Amjad
standing by him and in his hand the sword dyed with blood, and
the damsel lying dead. He enquired what had passed, and Amjad
told him all she had said, adding, "Nothing would satisfy her but
she must slay thee; and this is her reward." Then Bahadur rose
and, kissing the Prince's hand, said to him, "Would to Heaven
thou hadst spared her! but now there is nothing for it but to rid
us of her without stay or delay, before the day break." Then he
girded his loins and took the body, wrapped it in an Abá-cloak
and, laying it in a large basket of palm-leaves, he shouldered it
saying, "Thou art a stranger here and knowest no one: so sit thou
in this place and await my return till daybreak. If I come back
to thee, I will assuredly do thee great good service and use my
endeavours to have news of thy brother; but if by sunrise I return
not, know that all is over with me; and peace be on thee, and the
house and all it containeth of stuffs and money are thine." Then
he fared forth from the saloon bearing the basket; and, threading
the streets, he made for the salt sea, thinking to throw it therein:
but as he drew near the shore, he turned and saw that the Chief of
Police and his officers had ranged themselves around him; and, on
recognising him, they wondered and opened the basket, wherein
they found the slain woman. So they seized him and laid him in
bilboes all that night till the morning, when they carried him and
the basket, as it was, to the King and reported the case. The
King was sore enraged when he looked upon the slain and said to
Bahadur, "Woe to thee! Thou art always so doing; thou killest
folk and castest them into the sea and takest their goods. How
many murders hast thou done ere this?" Thereupon Bahadur
hung his head——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and
ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahadur
hung down his head groundwards before the King, who cried out
at him, saying, "Woe to thee! Who killed this girl?" He replied,
"O my lord! I killed her, and there is no Majesty and there is no
Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1624" id="noteref-1624" epub:type="noteref">1624</a> So the King in
his anger, commanded to hang him; and the hangman went down
with him by the King's commandment, and the Chief of Police
accompanied him with a crier who called upon all the folk to witness
the execution of Bahadur, the King's Master of the Horse;
and on this wise they paraded him through the main streets and
the market-streets. This is how it fared with Bahadur; but as
regards Amjad, he awaited his host's return till the day broke and
the sun rose, and when he saw that he came not, he exclaimed,
"There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
Glorious, the Great! Would I knew what is become of him?"
And, as he sat musing behold, he heard the crier proclaiming
Bahadur's sentence and bidding the people to see the spectacle of
his hanging at mid-day; whereat he wept and exclaimed, "Verily,
we are Allah's and to Him we are returning! He meaneth to
sacrifice himself unjustly for my sake, when I it was who slew her.
By Allah, this shall never be!" Then he went from the saloon
and, shutting the door after him, hurriedly threaded the streets till
he overtook Bahadur, when he stood before the Chief of Police
and said to him, "O my lord, put not Bahadur to death, for he is
innocent. By Allah, none killed her but I." Now when the
Captain of Police heard these words, he took them both and,
carrying them before the King, acquainted him with what Amjad
had said; whereupon he looked at the Prince and asked him,
"Didst thou kill the damsel?" He answered, "Yes" and the
King said, "Tell me why thou killedst her, and speak the truth."
Replied Amjad, "O King, it is indeed a marvellous event and a
wondrous matter that hath befallen me: were it graven with
needles on the eye-corners, it would serve as a warner to whoso
would be warned!" Then he told him his whole story and
informed him of all that had befallen him and his brother, first and
last; whereat the King was much startled and surprised and said
to him, "Know that now I find thee to be excusable; but list, O
youth! Wilt thou be my Wazír?" "Hearkening and obedience,"
answered Amjad; whereupon the King bestowed magnificent
dresses of honour on him and Bahadur and gave him a handsome
house, with eunuchs and officers and all things needful, appointing
him stipends and allowances and bidding him make search for his
brother As'ad. So Amjad sat down in the seat of the Wazirate
and governed and did justice and invested and deposed and took
and gave. Moreover, he sent out a crier to cry his brother
throughout the city, and for many days made proclamation in the
main streets and market-streets, but heard no news of As'ad nor
happened on any trace of him. Such was his case; but as regards
his brother, the Magi ceased not to torture As'ad night and day
and eve and morn for a whole year's space, till their festival drew
near, when the old man Bahram<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1625" id="noteref-1625" epub:type="noteref">1625</a> made ready for the voyage and
fitted out a ship for himself.——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Bahram, the
Magian, having fitted out a ship for the voyage, took As'ad and
put him in a chest which he locked and had it transported on
board. Now it so came to pass that, at the very time of shipping
it, Amjad was standing to divert himself by looking upon the sea;
and when he saw the men carrying the gear and shipping it, his
heart throbbed and he called to his pages to bring him his beast.
Then, mounting with a company of his officers, he rode down to
the sea-side and halted before the Magian's ship, which he commanded
his men to board and search. They did his bidding, and
boarded the vessel and rummaged in every part, but found nothing;
so they returned and told Amjad, who mounted again and
rode back. But he felt troubled in mind; and when he reached
his place and entered his palace, he cast his eyes on the wall and
saw written thereon two lines which were these couplets:——</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">"My friends! if ye are banisht from mine eyes, ✿ From heart and mind ye ne'er go wandering:</div>
      <div class="line">But ye have left me in my woe, and rob ✿ Rest from my eyelids while ye are slumbering."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>And seeing them Amjad thought of his brother and wept. Such
was his case; but as for Bahram, the Magian, he embarked and
shouted and bawled to his crew to make sail in all haste. So they
shook out the sails and departed and ceased not to fare on many
days and nights; and, every other day, Bahram took out As'ad
and gave him a bit of bread and made him drink a sup of water,
till they drew near the Mountain of Fire. Then there came out
on them a storm-wind and the sea rose against them, so that the
ship was driven out of her course till she took a wrong line and
fell into strange waters; and, at last they came in sight of a city
builded upon the shore, with a castle whose windows overlooked
the main. Now the ruler of this city was a Queen called
Marjánah, and the captain said to Bahram, "O my lord, we have
strayed from our course and come to the island of Queen
Marjanah, who is a devout Moslemah; and, if she know that we
are Magians, she will take our ship and slay us to the last man.
Yet needs must we put in here to rest and refit." Quoth Bahram,
"Right is thy recking, and whatso thou seest fit that will I do!"
Said the ship-master, "If the Queen summon us and question us,
how shall we answer her?"; and Bahram replied, "Let us clothe
this Moslem we have with us in a Mameluke's habit and carry him
ashore with us, so that when the Queen sees him, she will suppose
and say, This is a slave. As for me I will tell her that I am a
slave-dealer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1626" id="noteref-1626" epub:type="noteref">1626</a> who buys and sells white slaves, and that I had with
me many but have sold all save this one, whom I retained to keep
my accounts, for he can read and write." And the captain said,
"This device should serve." Presently they reached the city and
slackened sail and cast the anchors; and the ship lay still, when
behold, Queen Marjanah came down to them, attended by her
guards and, halting before the vessel, called out to the captain,
who landed and kissed the ground before her. Quoth she, "What
is the lading of this thy ship and whom hast thou with thee?"
Quoth he, "O Queen of the Age, I have with me a merchant who
dealeth in slaves." And she said, "Hither with him to me";
whereupon Bahram came ashore to her, with As'ad walking behind
him in a slave's habit, and kissed the earth before her. She
asked, "What is thy condition?"; and he answered, "I am a
dealer in chattels." Then she looked at As'ad and, taking him
for a Mameluke, asked him, "What is thy name, O youth?"
He answered, "Dost thou ask my present or my former name?"
"Hast thou then two names?" enquired she, and he replied (and
indeed his voice was choked with tears), "Yes; my name aforetime
was Al-As'ad, the most happy, but now it is Al-Mu'tarr—Miserrimus."
Her heart inclined to him and she said, "Canst thou
write?" "Yes," answered he, and she gave him ink-case and reed-pen
and paper and said to him, "Write somewhat that I may see
it." So he wrote these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">What can the slave do when pursued by Fate, ✿ O justest Judge! whatever be his state?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1627" id="noteref-1627" epub:type="noteref">1627</a></div>
      <div class="line">Whom God throws hand-bound in the depths and says, ✿ Beware lest water should thy body wet?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1628" id="noteref-1628" epub:type="noteref">1628</a></div>
    </div>

<div class="ic010">
<p>A. Lalauze Pinæ et Sc.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Now when she read these lines, she had ruth upon him and said to
Bahram, "Sell me this slave." He replied, "O my lady, I cannot
sell him, for I have parted with all the rest and none is left with
me but he." Quoth the Queen, "I must need have him of thee,
either by sale or way of gift." But quoth Bahram, "I will neither
sell him nor give him." Whereat she was wroth and, taking As'ad
by the hand, carried him up to the castle and sent to Bahram,
saying, "Except thou set sail and depart our city this very night,
I will seize all thy goods and break up thy ship." Now when the
message reached the Magian, he grieved with sore grief and cried,
"Verily this voyage is on no wise to be commended." Then he
arose and made ready and took all he needed and awaited the
coming of the night to resume his voyage, saying to the sailors,
"Provide yourselves with your things and fill your water-skins,
that we may set sail at the last of the night." So the sailors did
their business and awaited the coming of darkness. Such was
their case; but as regards Queen Marjanah, when she had brought
As'ad into the castle, she opened the casements overlooking the
sea and bade her handmaids bring food. They set food before
As'ad and herself and both ate, after which the Queen called for
wine——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased
saying her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-fifth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen
Marjanah bade her handmaids bring wine and they set it before
her, she fell to drinking with As'ad. Now, Allah (be He extolled
and exalted!) filled her heart with love for the Prince and she
kept filling his cup and handing it to him till his reason fled; and
presently he rose and left the hall to satisfy a call of nature. As
he passed out of the saloon he saw an open door through which
he went and walked on till his walk brought him to a vast garden
full of all manner fruits and flowers; and, sitting down under a
tree, he did his occasion. Then he rose and went up to a jetting
fountain in the garden and made the lesser ablution and washed
his hands and face, after which he would have risen to go away;
but the air smote him and he fell back, with his clothes undone
and slept, and night overcame him thus. So far concerning him;
but as concerns Bahram, the night being come, he cried out to his
crew, saying, "Set sail and let us away!"; and they answered,
"We hear and obey, but wait till we fill our water-skins and then
we will set sail." So they landed with their water-skins and went
round about the castle, and found nothing but garden-walls:
whereupon they climbed over into the garden and followed the
track of feet, which led them to the fountain; and there they
found As'ad lying on his back. They knew him and were glad to
find him; and, after filling their water-skins, they bore him off and
climbed the wall again with him and carried him back in haste
to Bahram to whom they said, "Hear the good tidings of thy
winning thy wish; and gladden thy heart and beat thy drums
and sound thy pipes; for thy prisoner, whom Queen Marjanah
took from thee by force, we have found and brought back to
thee"; and they threw As'ad down before him. When Bahram
saw him, his heart leapt for joy and his breast swelled with gladness.
Then he bestowed largesse on the sailors and bade them set
sail in haste. So they sailed forthright, intending to make the
Mountain of Fire and stayed not their course till the morning.
This is how it fared with them; but as regards Queen Marjanah,
she abode awhile, after As'ad went down from her, awaiting his
return in vain for he came not; thereupon she rose and sought
him, yet found no trace of him. Then she bade her women light
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">flambeaux</span> and look for him, whilst she went forth in person
and, seeing the garden-door open, knew that he had gone thither.
So she went out into the garden and finding his sandals lying by
the fountain, searched the place in every part, but came upon no
sign of him; and yet she gave not over the search till morning.
Then she enquired for the ship and they told her, "The vessel set
sail in the first watch of the night"; wherefor she knew that
they had taken As'ad with them, and this was grievous to her
and she was sore angered. She bade equip ten great ships
forthwith and, making ready for fight, embarked in one of the ten
with her Mamelukes and slave-women and men-at-arms, all splendidly
accoutred and weaponed for war. They spread the sails and
she said to the captains, "If you overtake the Magian's ship, ye
shall have of me dresses of honour and largesse of money; but if
you fail so to do, I will slay you to the last man." Whereat fear
and great hope animated the crews and they sailed all that day
and the night and the second day and the third day till, on the
fourth they sighted the ship of Bahram, the Magian, and before
evening fell the Queen's squadron had surrounded it on all sides,
just as Bahram had taken As'ad forth of the chest and was beating
and torturing him, whilst the Prince cried out for help and
deliverance, but found neither helper nor deliverer: and the
grievous bastinado sorely tormented him. Now while so occupied,
Bahram chanced to look up and, seeing himself encompassed
by the Queen's ships, as the white of the eye encompasseth the
black, he gave himself up for lost and groaned and said, "Woe to
thee, O As'ad! This is all out of thy head." Then taking him
by the hand he bade his men throw him overboard and cried, "By
Allah I will slay thee before I die myself!" So they carried him
along by the hands and feet and cast him into the sea and he
sank; but Allah (be He extolled and exalted!) willed that his life
be saved and that his doom be deferred; so He caused him to sink
and rise again and he struck out with his hands and feet, till the
Almighty gave him relief, and sent him deliverance; and the waves
bore him far from the Magian's ship and threw him ashore. He
landed, scarce crediting his escape, and once more on land he
doffed his clothes and wrung them and spread them out to dry;
whilst he sat naked and weeping over his condition, and bewailing
his calamities and mortal dangers, and captivity and strangerhood.
And presently he repeated these two couplets:—</p>

<div class="lg-container-b c002">
  <div class="linegroup">
    <div class="group">
      <div class="line">Allah, my patience fails: I have no ward; ✿ My breast is straitened and clean cut my cord;</div>
      <div class="line">To whom shall wretched slave of case complain, ✿ Save to his Lord? O thou of lords the Lord!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Then, having ended his verse, he rose and donned his clothes but
he knew not whither to go or whence to come; so he fed on the
herbs of the earth and the fruits of the trees and he drank of the
streams, and fared on night and day till he came in sight of a city;
whereupon he rejoiced and hastened his pace; but when he reached
it——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to
say her permitted say.</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c004">
    <div>Now when it was the Two Hundred and Thirty-sixth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when he
reached the city the shades of evening closed around him and the
gates were shut. Now by the decrees of Fate and man's lot this
was the very city wherein he had been a prisoner and to whose
King his brother Amjad was Minister. When As'ad saw the gate
was locked, he turned back and made for the burial-ground, where
finding a tomb without a door, he entered therein and lay down
and fell asleep, with his face covered by his long sleeve.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1629" id="noteref-1629" epub:type="noteref">1629</a> Meanwhile,
Queen Marjanah, coming up with Bahram's ship, questioned
him of As'ad. Now the Magian, when Queen Marjanah overtook
him with her ships, baffled her by his artifice and gramarye; swearing
to her that he was not with him and that he knew nothing of
him. She searched the ship, but found no trace of her friend, so
she took Bahram and, carrying him back to her castle, would have
put him to death, but he ransomed himself from her with all his
good and his ship; and she released him and his men. They
went forth from her hardly believing in their deliverance, and
fared on ten days' journey till they came to their own city and
found the gate shut, it being eventide. So they made for the
burial-ground, thinking to lie the night there and, going round
about the tombs, as Fate and Fortune would have it, saw the
building wherein As'ad lay wide open; whereat Bahram marvelled
and said, "I must look into this sepulchre." Then
he entered and found As'ad lying in a corner fast asleep, with
his head covered by his sleeve; so he raised his head, and looking
in his face, knew him for the man on whose account he
had lost his goods and his ship, and cried, "What! art thou yet
alive?" Then he bound him and gagged him without further
parley, and carried him to his house, where he clapped heavy
shackles on his feet and lowered him into the underground dungeon
aforesaid prepared for the tormenting of Moslems, and he
bade his daughter by name Bostán,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1630" id="noteref-1630" epub:type="noteref">1630</a> torture him night and day,
till the next year, when they would again visit the Mountain of
Fire and there offer him up as a sacrifice. Then he beat him
grievously and locking the dungeon door upon him, gave the keys
to his daughter. By and by, Bostan opened the door and went
down to beat him, but finding him a comely youth and a sweet-faced
with arched brows and eyes black with nature's Kohl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1631" id="noteref-1631" epub:type="noteref">1631</a> she fell in
love with him and asked him, "What is thy name?" "My name
is As'ad," answered he; whereat she cried, "Mayst thou indeed
be happy as thy name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1632" id="noteref-1632" epub:type="noteref">1632</a> and happy be thy days! Thou deservest
not torture and blows, and I see thou hast been injuriously entreated."
And she comforted him with kind words and loosed
his bonds. Then she questioned him of the religion of Al-Islam
and he told her that it was the true and right Faith and that our
lord Mohammed had approved himself by surpassing miracles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1633" id="noteref-1633" epub:type="noteref">1633</a>
and signs manifest, and that fire-worship is harmful and not
profitable; and he went on to expound to her the tenets of
Al-Islam till she was persuaded and the love of the True Faith
entered her heart. Then, as Almighty Allah had mixed up with
her being a fond affection for As'ad, she pronounced the Two
Testimonies<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1634" id="noteref-1634" epub:type="noteref">1634</a> of the Faith and became of the people of felicity.
After this, she brought him meat and drink and talked with him
and they prayed together: moreover, she made him chicken stews
and fed him therewith, till he regained strength and his sickness
left him and he was restored to his former health. Such things
befel him with the daughter of Bahram, the Magian; and so it
happened that one day she left him and stood at the house-door
when behold, she heard the crier crying aloud and saying, "Whoso
hath with him a handsome young man, whose favour is thus and
thus, and bringeth him forth, shall have all he seeketh of money;
but if any have him and deny it, he shall be hanged over his own
door and his property shall be plundered and his blood go for
naught." Now As'ad had acquainted Bostan bint Bahram with
his whole history: so, when she heard the crier, she knew that it
was he who was sought for and, going down to him, told him the
news. Then he fared forth and made for the mansion of the
Wazir, whom, when As'ad saw, he exclaimed, "By Allah, this
Minister is my brother Amjad!" Then he went up (and the
damsel walking behind him) to the Palace, where he again saw
his brother, and threw himself upon him; whereupon Amjad
also knew him and fell upon his neck and they embraced each
other, whilst the Wazir's Mamelukes dismounted and stood round
them. They lay awhile insensible and, when they came to themselves,
Amjad took his brother and carried him to the Sultan, to
whom he related the whole story, and the Sultan charged him to
plunder Bahram's house.——And Shahrazad perceived the dawn
of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Sultan
ordered Amjad to plunder Bahram's house and to hang its owner.
So Amjad despatched thither for that purpose a company of men,
who sacked the house and took Bahram and brought his daughter
to the Wazir by whom she was received with all honour, for As'ad
had told his brother the torments he had suffered and the kindness
she had done him. Thereupon Amjad related in his turn
to As'ad all that had passed between himself and the damsel;
and how he had escaped hanging and had become Wazir; and
they made moan, each to other, of the anguish they had suffered
for separation. Then the Sultan summoned Bahram and bade
strike off his head; but he said, "O most mighty King, art thou
indeed resolved to put me to death?" Replied the King, "Yes,
except thou save thyself by becoming a Moslem." Quoth Bahram,
"O King, bear with me a little while!" Then he bowed
his head groundwards and presently raising it again, made profession
of The Faith and islamised at the hands of the Sultan.
They all rejoiced at his conversion and Amjad and As'ad told
him all that had befallen them, whereat he wondered and said,
"O my lords, make ready for the journey and I will depart with
you and carry you back to your father's court in a ship." At
this they rejoiced and wept with sore weeping; but he said, "O
my lords, weep not for your departure, for it shall reunite you with
those you love, even as were Ni'amah and Naomi." "And what
befel Ni'amah and Naomi?" asked they. "They tell," replied
Bahram, (but Allah alone is All-knowing) the following tale of</p>
