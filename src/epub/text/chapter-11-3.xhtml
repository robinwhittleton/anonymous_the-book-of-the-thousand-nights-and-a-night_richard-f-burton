			<h2 epub:type="title">Al-Hajjaj and the Three Young Men<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5180" id="noteref-5180" epub:type="noteref">5180</a></h2>

<p>They tell that Al-Hajjáj<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5181" id="noteref-5181" epub:type="noteref">5181</a> once bade the Chief of Police go his
rounds about Bassorah city by night, and whomsoever he found
abroad after supper-tide that he should smite his neck. So he
went round one night of the nights and came upon three youths
swaying and staggering from side to side, and on them signs of
wine-bibbing. So the watch laid hold of them and the captain said
to them, “Who be you that ye durst transgress the commandment
of the Commander of the Faithful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5182" id="noteref-5182" epub:type="noteref">5182</a> and come abroad at this
hour?” Quoth one of the youths, “I am the son of him to whom
all necks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5183" id="noteref-5183" epub:type="noteref">5183</a> abase themselves, alike the nose-pierced of them and the
breaker; they come to him in their own despite, abject and submissive,
and he taketh of their wealth and of their blood.” The
Master of Police held his hand from him, saying, “Belike he is of
the kinsmen of the Prince of True Believers,” and said to the
second, “Who art thou?” Quoth he, “I am the son of him whose
rank<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5184" id="noteref-5184" epub:type="noteref">5184</a> Time abaseth not, and if it be lowered one day, ’twill
assuredly return to its former height; thou seest the folk crowd
in troops to the light of his fire, some standing around it and some
sitting.” So the Chief of Police refrained from slaying him and
asked the third, “Who art thou?” He answered, “I am the son
of him who plungeth through the ranks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5185" id="noteref-5185" epub:type="noteref">5185</a> with his might and
levelleth them with the sword, so that they stand straight: his
feet are not loosed from the stirrup, whenas the horsemen on the
day of the battle are a-weary.” So the Master of Police held his
hand from him also, saying, “Belike, he is the son of a Brave of
the Arabs.” Then he kept them under guard, and when the
morning morrowed, he referred their case to Al-Hajjaj, who caused
bring them before him and enquiring into their affair, when
behold, the first was the son of a barber-surgeon, the second of a
bean-seller and the third of a weaver. So he marvelled at their
eloquent readiness of speech and said to the men of his assembly,
“Teach your sons the rhetorical use of Arabic:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5186" id="noteref-5186" epub:type="noteref">5186</a> for, by Allah, but
for their ready wit, I had smitten off their heads!”</p>
