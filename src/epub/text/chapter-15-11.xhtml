			<h2 epub:type="title">The Syrian and the Three Women of Cairo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7476" id="noteref-7476" epub:type="noteref">7476</a></h2>

<p>There was a man, a Shámí, who came to the God-guarded city of
Misr al-Káhirah—Misr of Mars—and with him was a store of
money and merchandize and sumptuous clothing. He hired for
himself a room in a caravanserai, and having no slave, he was
wont to go forth every day and roam about the city-thoroughfares
and cater for himself. Now this continued for a while of time
till one day of the days, as he was wandering and diverting his
mind by looking to the right and to the left, he was met on the
way by three women who were leaning and swaying one towards
other as they walked on laughing aloud; and each and every of
the three surpassed her fellow in beauty and loveliness. When he
looked at them his mustachios curled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7477" id="noteref-7477" epub:type="noteref">7477</a> at the sight and he
accosted them and addressed the trio, saying, “May it be that ye
will drink coffee in my lodging?” “Indeed we will,” said they,
“and we will make mirth with thee and exceeding merriment,
passing even the will of thee.” Quoth he, “When shall it be?”
and quoth they, “To-night we will come to thy place.” He continued,
“I am living in a room of Such-and-such a Wakálah.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7478" id="noteref-7478" epub:type="noteref">7478</a>
and they rejoined, “Do thou make ready for us supper and we
will visit thee after the hour of night-prayers.” He cried, “These
words are well;” so they left him and went their ways; and he,
on the return way home, bought flesh and greens and wine and
perfumes; then, having reached his room, he cooked five kinds of
meats without including rice and conserves, and made ready
whatso for the table was suitable. Now when it was supper-time
behold, the women came in to him, all three wearing capotes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7479" id="noteref-7479" epub:type="noteref">7479</a>
over their dresses, and when they had entered they threw these
cloaks off their shoulders and took their seats as they were moons.
Hereupon the Syrian arose and set before them the food-trays
and they ate their sufficiency, after which he served to them the
table of wine, whereat they filled and passed to him and he
accepted and swilled until his head whirled round, and as often
as he looked at any one of them and considered her in her mould
of beauty and loveliness he was perplext and his wits were wildered.
They ceased not to be after such fashion until the noon o’ night,——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night
an the King suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Forty-seventh Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting
and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the
Syrian and the three ladies ceased not to persevere in the drinking
of wine until the noon o’ night, at which time he would not
distinguish between masculine and feminine from the excess of
his wine-bibbing, so he said to one of the three, “Allah, upon
thee, O my lady, what may be the name of thee?” She replied,
“I am hight ’Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me?’” Whereat he exclaimed,
“No, Walláhi!” Then he up-propped himself on his
elbow and rising from the ground said to the second, “Thou, O
my lady, and life-blood of my heart, what is thy name?”
She answered, “I am hight, ’Never-sawest-thou-my-like,’” and
he replied, “Inshallah—what Allah willeth—O my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like.”
Then said he to the third, “And thou, O
dearling of my heart, what may be the name of thee?” And
said she, “I am hight ’Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.’”
When he heard these words he cried out with a loud outcry and
fell to the ground saying, “No, by Allah, O my lady, Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7480" id="noteref-7480" epub:type="noteref">7480</a>
But when the three women regarded
him his reason was upset and they forced upon him more wine-bibbing
whilst he cried to them, “Fill for me, ho my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like,
and thou too, my lady Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me,
and eke thou, O my lady Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me.”
And they drove him to drink still more until he fell
to the ground without a vein swelling<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7481" id="noteref-7481" epub:type="noteref">7481</a> for he had become drunken
and dead drunk. When they saw him in this condition they doffed
his turband and crowned him with a cap, and fringes projecting
from the peak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7482" id="noteref-7482" epub:type="noteref">7482</a> which they had brought with them; then they
arose and finding in his room a box full of raiment and ready
money, they rifled all that was therein. Presently they donned
their dresses and, waiting until the door of the Wakalah was
opened after the call to the morning-prayer, they went their ways
and the Veiler vouchsafed them protection<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7483" id="noteref-7483" epub:type="noteref">7483</a> and they left the
Syrian man in his room strown as a tried toper and unknowing
what the women had done with him of their wile and guile. Now
when it was the undurn-hour he awoke from his crapula and
opening his eyes, cried, “Ho my lady Never-sawest-thou-my-like!
and ho my lady Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me! and ho my lady
Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know me!” But none returned to
him any reply. Then he pulled himself together and glanced
carefully around but his sight fell not upon anyone beside him, so
he arose and went to the box wherein he found never a single thing.
This restored him to his right senses and he recovered from his
drink and cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might save
in Allah, the Glorious, the Great: this be a judgment they have
wrought for me.” Then he went forth still wearing the tall fringed
cap and knowing nothing of himself and, when he had issued from
his caravanserai, he cried to everyone he met in the streets, “I
am seeking Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me?” and the men would
reply, “No, I never sighted the like of thee;” and to a second he
would say, “I am looking for one Never-sawest-thou-aught-like-me;”
and the other would answer, “Indeed, I never beheld thy
fellow;” then he would ask a third “Hast thou seen one Look-at-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me?”
and the questioned would answer,
“Indeed, I have looked at thee but I know thee not at all.” And
he ceased not wandering about, bonnet on head, and everyone
who met him by the way returned him the like replies until he
came upon a party of folk who were in front of a barber’s booth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7484" id="noteref-7484" epub:type="noteref">7484</a>
There he cried upon them also, “Ah! Hast-thou-seen-aught-like-me!
and Ah! Never-sawest-thou-my-like! and Ah! Look upon-me-and-thou-shalt-know-me!”
Hereat, understanding that he was
touched in brain and this was a judgment that had been wrought
upon him, they seized him and forced him into the barber’s shop
and bringing a mirror set it in his hands. When he looked therein
he found a fool’s cap upon his head, so forthwith he tore it off and
took thought and said to those present, “Who of you can guide
me to those three women?” They said to him, “O Syrian,
march off with thyself to thy own land for that the folk of Egypt
can play with the egg and the stone.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7485" id="noteref-7485" epub:type="noteref">7485</a> So he arose without stay
and delay; then, taking what provaunt was sufficient for the way
and what little of fine raiment had been left to him, he quitted
Cairo intending for his own country. Now the Emir hearing this
tale of the Shahbandar wondered thereof with extreme wonderment
and said to the Gentleman, “An thou have finished do thou
fare forth and go about thy business.” Accordingly he went from
him still garbed in gaberdine and bonnet on head when the house-master
asked his wife, “Who of them here remaineth with thee?”
And she answered, “Have patience and I will bring thee the
third.” So she arose and opening another closet summoned the
Flesher and taking him by the hand, whilst he was ashamed and
abashed, led him till he stood before her spouse and the poor
fellow availed not to raise his eyes from the ground. Presently
the husband considered him and knew him and was certified that
he was Such-and-such the Chief Butcher and head of the craft, so
he said to him, “Ho thou the clever one, do thou dance for us a
wee and after that tell us a tale.” Accordingly he stood up and
clapped hands and fell to dancing and prancing till such time as
he dropped down for fatigue; after which he said, “O my lord, I
have by me a tale anent the craft and cunning of women.” Asked
the other, “And what may it be?” and the Butcher began to relate
the tale of</p>
