<p>As for King Shahryar, he wondered at Shahrazad with the utmost
wonder and drew her near to his heart of his abounding affection
for her; and she was magnified in his eyes and he said within
himself, “By Allah, the like of this is not deserving of slaughter,
for indeed the time favoureth us not with her equal. By the
Almighty, I have been reckless of mine affair, and had not the
Lord overcome me with His ruth and put this one at my service
so she might recount to me instances manifest and cases truthful
and admonitions goodly and traits edifying, such as should restore
me to the right road, I had come to ruin! Wherefore to Allah be
the praise herefor and I beseech the Most High to make my end
with her like that of the Wazir and Shah Bakht.” Then sleep
overcame the king and glory be unto Him who sleepeth not!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5625" id="noteref-5625" epub:type="noteref">5625</a>
When it was the Nine hundred and thirtieth Night, Shahrazad
said, “O king, there is present in my thought a tale which treateth
of women’s trickery and wherein is a warning to whoso will be
warned and an admonishment to whoso will be admonished and
whoso hath sight and insight; but I fear lest the hearing of this
belittle me with the liege-lord and lower my degree in his esteem;
yet I hope that this will not be, because ’tis a rare tale. Women
are indeed mischief-makers; their craft and their cunning may not
be told nor may their wiles be known; while men enjoy their
company and are not instant to uphold them in the right way,
neither are they vigilant over them with all vigilance, but relish
their society and take whatso is winsome and regard not that which
is other than this. Indeed, they are like unto the crooked rib,
which an thou go about to straighten, thou distortest it, and
which an thou persist in straightening, thou breakest it;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5626" id="noteref-5626" epub:type="noteref">5626</a> so it
behoveth the wise man to be silent concerning them.” Thereupon
quoth Dinarzad, “O sister mine, bring forth that which is with
thee and that which is present to thy mind of the story concerning
the guile of women and their wiles, and have no fear lest this
lessen thee with the king; for that women are, like jewels, of all
kinds and colours. When a gem falleth into the hand of an
expert, he keepeth it for himself and leaveth all beside it. Eke
he preferreth some of them over others, and in this he is like the
potter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5627" id="noteref-5627" epub:type="noteref">5627</a> who filleth his kiln with all the vessels he hath moulded
and under them kindleth his fire. When the baking is done and
he taketh out that which is in the kiln, he findeth no help for it
but that he must break some of them, whilst others are what the
folk need and whereof they make use, while yet others there are
which return to be as they were. So fear thou not nor deem it a
grave matter to adduce that which thou knowest of the craft of
women, for that in this is profit for all folk.” Then said
Shahrazad, “They relate, O king (but Allah alone knoweth the
secret things) the Tale of—</p>
