			<h2 epub:type="title">The Tailor and the Lady and the Captain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7464" id="noteref-7464" epub:type="noteref">7464</a></h2>

<p>It is related that a Tailor was sitting in his shop facing a tall
house tenanted by a Yúzbáshi, and this man had a wife who was
unique for beauty and loveliness. Now one day of the days as
she looked out at the latticed window the Snip espied her and
was distraught by her comeliness and seemlihead. So he became
engrossed by love of her and remained all day a-gazing at the
casement disturbed and perturbed, and as often as she approached
the window and peered out therefrom, he would stare at her and
say to her, “O my lady and O core of my heart, good morning to
thee; and do thou have mercy upon one sore affected by his
affection to thee; one whose eyes sleep not by night for thy fair
sake.” “This pimp be Jinn-mad!” quoth the Captain’s wife,
“and as often as I look out at the window he dareth bespeak me:
haply the folk shall say:—Indeed she must needs be his mistress.”
But the Tailor persevered in this proceeding for a while of days
until the lady was offended thereby and said in her mind,
“Walláhi, there is no help but that I devise for him a device
which shall make unlawful to him this his staring and casting
sheep’s eyes at my casement; nay more, I will work for ousting
him from his shop.” So one day of the days when the Yuzbashi
went from home, his wife arose and adorned and beautified herself,
and donning the bestest of what dresses and decorations she had,
despatched one of her slave-girls to the Tailor instructing her to
say to him:—“My lady salameth to thee and biddeth thee come
and drink coffee with her.” The handmaiden went to his shop and
delivered the message; and he, when hearing these words,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7465" id="noteref-7465" epub:type="noteref">7465</a> waxed
bewildered of wits and rose up quivering in his clothes;——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and
ceased to say her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and
delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that
I would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer me
to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

    <div>The Seven Hundred and Forty-third Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that when the Tailor
heard the girl’s words, he quivered in his clothes; but indeed he
recked not aught of the wiles of womankind. So after padlocking
his shop he went with her to the house and walked upstairs,
where he was met by the lady with a face like the rondure of the
moon and she greeted him right merrily, and taking him by the
hand led him to a well-mattressed Divan and bade her slave-girl
serve him with coffee, and as he drank it she sat facing him.
Presently the twain fell to conversing, she and he; and she soothed
him with sweet speech, whilst he went clean out of his mind for
the excess of her beauty and loveliness. This lasted until near
midday, when she bade serve the dinner-trays, and took seat in
front of him, and he began picking up morsels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7466" id="noteref-7466" epub:type="noteref">7466</a> designed for his
lips and teeth, but in lieu thereof thrust them into his eye. She
laughed at him, but hardly had he swallowed the second mouthful
and the third when behold, the door was knocked, whereupon she
looked out from the casement and cried, “Oh my honour! this is
my husband.” Hereat the man’s hands and knees began to quake,
and he said to her, “Whither shall I wend?” Said she, “Go
into this closet,” and forthright she thrust him into a cabinet and
shot the bolt upon him and taking the key she tare out one of
its teeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7467" id="noteref-7467" epub:type="noteref">7467</a> and put it in her pocket. After this she went down
and opened the door to her husband who walked upstairs; and
finding the dinner trays bespread, asked her, “What is this?”
She answered, “I and my lover have been dining together.”
“And what may be thy lover?” “Here he is.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7468" id="noteref-7468" epub:type="noteref">7468</a> “Where may
he be?” to which she replied, “He is inside this closet.” Now
as soon as the Tailor heard her say this say, he piddled in his
bag-breeches and befouled himself and he was in a filthy state
with skite and piss.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7469" id="noteref-7469" epub:type="noteref">7469</a> Hereupon the Captain asked, “And where’s
the key?” and she answered, “Here it is with me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7470" id="noteref-7470" epub:type="noteref">7470</a> “Bring it
out,” said he, so she pulled it from her pocket and handed it to
him. The Captain took the key from his spouse and applying it
to the wooden bolt of the cabinet rattled it to and fro<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7471" id="noteref-7471" epub:type="noteref">7471</a> but it
would not open; so the wife came up to him and cried, “Allah
upon thee, O my lord, what wilt thou do with my playmate?” Said
he, “I will slay him!” and said she, “No, ’tis my opinion that thou
hadst better pinion him and bind him as if crucified to the pillar
in the court floor and then smite him with thy sword upon the neck
and cut off his head; for I, during my born days, never saw a
criminal put to death and now ’tis my desire to sight one done
to die.” “Sooth is thy speech,” quoth he: so he took the key and
fitting it into the wooden bolt would have drawn it back, but it
could not move because a tooth had been drawn therefrom and
the while he was rattling at the bolt his wife said to him, “O my
lord, ’tis my desire that thou lop off his hands and his feet until
he shall become marked by his maims;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7472" id="noteref-7472" epub:type="noteref">7472</a> and after do thou smite
his neck.” “A sensible speech,” cried the husband and during
the whole time her mate was striving to pull the bolt she kept
saying to him, “Do this and do that with the fellow,” and he
ceased not saying to her, “’Tis well.” All this and the Tailor sat
hearkening to their words and melting in his skin; but at last the
wife burst out laughing until she fell upon her back and her
husband asked her, “Whereat this merriment?” Answered she,
“I make mock of thee for that thou art wanting in wits and wisdom.”
Quoth he, “Wherefore?” and quoth she, “O my lord, had I a
lover and had he been with me should I have told aught of him to
thee? Nay; I said in my mind:—Do such and such with the
Captain and let’s see whether he will believe or disbelieve. Now
when I spake thou didst credit me and it became apparent to me
that thou art wanting in wits.” Cried he to her, “Allah disappoint
thee! Dost thou make jibe and jape of me? I also said
in my thoughts:—How can a man be with her and she speak of
him in the face of me?” So he arose and took seat with her, the
twain close together, at the dinner-tray and she fell to morselling
him and he to morselling her, and they laughed and ate until
they had their sufficiency and were filled; then they washed their
hands and drank coffee. After this they were cheered and they
toyed together and played the two-backed beast until their
pleasure was fulfilled and this was about mid-afternoon——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day and fell
silent and ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister
Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and
how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night, and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou be
other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale, that we may cut short the
watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With love
and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Yuzbashi fell
to toying with his wife, and thrusting and foining at her cleft<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7473" id="noteref-7473" epub:type="noteref">7473</a>, her
solution of continuity, and she wriggled to and fro to him, and
bucked up and down, after which he tumbled her and both were
<i><span xml:lang="la">in gloria</span></i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7474" id="noteref-7474" epub:type="noteref">7474</a> This lasted until near mid-afternoon when he arose
and went forth to the Hammam. But as soon as he left the house
she opened the cabinet and brought out the Tailor, saying, “Hast
thou seen what awaiteth thee, O pander, O impure? Now, by
Allah, an thou continue staring at the windows or durst bespeak
me with one single word it shall be the death of thee. This time
I have set thee free, but a second time I will work to the wasting of
thy heart’s blood.” Cried he, “I will do so no more; no, never!”
Thereupon said she to her slave-girl, “O handmaid, open to him the
door;” and she did so, and he fared forth (and he foully bewrayed
as to his nether garments) until he had returned to his shop. Now
when the Emir heard the tale of the Kazi, he rejoiced thereat and
said to him, “Up and gang thy gait!” so the Judge went off garbed
in his gaberdine and bonnet. Then said the house-master to his
wife, “This be one of the four, where’s Number Two?” Hereat
she arose and opened the closet in which was the Gentleman and
led him out by the hand till he stood before her husband, who
looked hard at him and was certified of him and recognised him
as the Shâhbandar; so he said to him, “O Khawájah, when didst
thou make thee a droll?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7475" id="noteref-7475" epub:type="noteref">7475</a> but the other returned to him neither
answer nor address and only bowed his brow groundwards. Quoth
the house-master to him, “Dance for us a wee and when thou
shalt have danced do thou tell us a tale.” So he fell perforce to
clapping his hands and skipping about until he fell down of fatigue
when he said, “O my lord, there is with me a rare story, and an
exceeding strange if thou of thy grace accord attention to my
words.” “Tell on and I will listen to thee,” quoth the other,
whereupon said the Gentleman, “’Tis concerning the wiles of
womankind,” and fell to relating the adventures of</p>
