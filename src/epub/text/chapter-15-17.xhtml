			<h2 epub:type="title">Mohammed the Shalabi and His Mistress and His Wife<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7555" id="noteref-7555" epub:type="noteref">7555</a></h2>

<p>It is told among the many things which happened in Cairo the
God-guarded that therein dwelt a man who was an Emir and who
had a son Mohammed Shalabi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7556" id="noteref-7556" epub:type="noteref">7556</a> hight, a youth in his day unique
for beauty and loveliness, nor in his time was there his peer for
comeliness and seemlihead amongst women or amongst men.
Now when he had attained the age of ten and was approaching
puberty, his sire betrothed him and wedded him to a fair wife who
loved him with fondest love even after marriage. There was also
in Misr a Kazi al-’Askar, a Judge of the Army, who had a
daughter singular for form and favour and bloom and brilliancy,
and stature and symmetric grace and she was known as Sitt
al-Husn—the Lady of Loveliness. Now one chance day of the
days she went forth together with her mother and the handmaidens
to the Baths and when they reached the half way behold,
they were confronted by the young Shalabi whose glance fell upon
the girl and her glance lit upon the youth, wherefrom love and
affection for him settled in her heart and it was with him after the
same fashion. Presently she began to send him messages and
letters and he to do on like guise, yet could neither win possession
of other nor indeed could the twain meet privately in one place.
This endured for the space of three years therefore were their
hearts melted in fire of mutual love-longing, until on a certain day
when desire in the girl surged high for her lover and likewise did
his yearning for his beloved; withal neither availed to win union.
Hereupon befel them sore travail and trouble and the young lady
sent an old woman to her dearling praying him to meet her in such
a site; and when the go-between had informed him thereof, he
arose to obey her without stay or delay, unknowing what was
hidden from him in the Secret Purpose. He fared till he came to
the place in question when it was the hour of sunset and here the
Shalabi forgathered with the Kazi’s daughter who had kept tryst
with him accompanied by her handmaidens; and anon the twain,
he and she, repaired to a retired spot. Now by the decree of the
Decreer which is written upon the foreheads and the brows of mankind,
one of the folk belonging to the Chief of Police was loitering
about the place when the couple entered that secret stead; and as
soon as they had settled themselves comfortably, each began complaining
to other of the pangs of separation. After this the
handmaidens brought to them food, meat and wine, and they ate
and drank and toyed and were cheered and made merry from set
of sun till the noon o’ night and they conversed together as boon
companions until either was fulfilled of other and the pains of
parting had vanished from their hearts. Such was the case with
the lover and the beloved; but as regards the Wali’s man who was
looking upon them and listening, he well knew the place wherein
the couple had retired and having noted it and certified himself
thereof, he went to the Chief of Police and made his report saying,
“In such a site of such a ward are a man and a maid whereupon
show the signs of affluence, and doubtless an thou seize them thou
shalt easily get from each and either some fifteen purses.” The
Wali hearing these words forthwith led out his party and marched
with them to the spot appointed; and he ceased not wending for
half the night until they all came to the trysting place. Then he
pushed forward axe<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7557" id="noteref-7557" epub:type="noteref">7557</a> in hand and smote the door and broke it
down; and forthright he rushed into the room without being
expected by the youth or the young lady whom he found sitting
together in the very height of enjoyment. But when they saw him
suddenly appear they were consterned and confounded and confused
as to their affair, so he arrested them and led them off and carried
them to his house, where he placed them in prison.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7558" id="noteref-7558" epub:type="noteref">7558</a> Forthwith
the bruit concerning the youth went abroad and reached his family;
to wit, how Mohammed Shalabi had been seized by the Chief of
Police, together with the girl his beloved. Now after imprisoning
them the Wali said, “This pair shall remain with me for a day
or two days and until I catch them in their robbery;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7559" id="noteref-7559" epub:type="noteref">7559</a> but
quoth one of the party, “Indeed thou knowest not and thou hast
not learnt that this damsel is the daughter of the Kazi of the Army
who throughout the past year wrought for the slaying of thee by
the Sultan.” And hardly had the Wali heard these words than
his heart was filled with joy and he exclaimed, “By Allah, needs
must I have his wench disgraced and proclaimed by bell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7560" id="noteref-7560" epub:type="noteref">7560</a> about
the thoroughfares of Cairo and him dishonoured in the presence
of the Sultan and degraded from his degree.” Now when it was
morning-tide a rumour flew about town that the Judge’s daughter
had been seized by the Wali and the watch together with the
young Shalabi in a certain place and presently the report reached
her father who cried, “There is no Majesty and there is no Might
save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! O Saving God, save me!
Oh vile disgrace and foul dishonour before Sultan and subjects
who shall say the Kazi’s daughter hath been seduced and abused.
However may the Veiler enveil me!” On his part the Wali went
up to the Palace and sought the Sovran to acquaint him therewith;
but, finding that he had business, he sat him down to await its
ending when he purposed informing him concerning the daughter
of his enemy the Chief Kazi. On such wise it befel him; but as
regards the wife of the youth who was lover to the girl, as soon as
the rumour reached her that the Shalabi had been arrested by the
Wali and the watch, she arose to her feet without stay and delay
and doffing whatso of woman’s dress was upon her——And
Shahrazad was surprised by the dawn of day, and fell silent and
ceased saying her permitted say. Then quoth her sister Dunyazad,
“How sweet and tasteful is thy tale, O sister mine, and how
enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth she, “And where is this
compared with that I would relate to you on the coming night an
the Sovran suffer me to survive?” Now when it was the next
night and that was</p>

<div class="ph3">

<div class="nf-center-c1">
<div class="nf-center c005">
    <div>The Seven Hundred and Seventy-fourth Night,</div>
  </div>
</div>

</div>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and good will! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that as soon as the
Shalabi’s wife was informed touching her husband how the Wali
had seized him in company with the Kazi’s daughter, she arose
forthright and doffing whatso of woman’s dress was upon her and
donning man’s disguise provided herself with somewhat of provaunt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7561" id="noteref-7561" epub:type="noteref">7561</a>
and went forth intending for the gaol in the Wali’s house.
She asked for the road as she went and a man of the people
directed her to the office until she reached the place carrying her
victuals; then she enquired for the gaoler. So they made him
meet her and quoth she, “Open to me the prison wherein they have
gaoled the Shalabi and the maiden,” and she promised him by signs
a gold piece; hereupon he admitted her and she passed into the
room where lay her spouse and the girl and set meat before him.
But he knew her not and cried, “Indeed I will nor eat nor drink,
and do thou fare from me and leave me in this my plight.” Quoth
she, “Nay, thou must eat and gladness shall befal thee.” Accordingly
he came forward and ate a small matter and she after sitting
with him for an hour or so, arose and doffed her man’s dress. Then
she stripped the Kazi’s daughter of all the clothes she was wearing
and garbed her in the masculine garb wherewith she had entered
to the twain. The young lady did as she was bidden and showed
likest to the Shalabi’s wife who lastly served her with what
remained of the meat and said to her, “Up with thee and hie thee
home.” So the Kazi’s daughter fared forth under the disguise of
a dainty youth such an one as he who anon had entered the gaol;
and as soon as she had wended her way the wife took seat beside
her husband. When he saw her habited in the habit of the Kazi’s
daughter he recognised her and knew her for his spouse; so he
asked of her, “What hath brought thee hither?” and she answered,
“I have come with this contrivance for the purpose of saving thee
and of saving the honour of the girl thou lovest.” But as soon as
the Kazi’s daughter had departed in her disguise the gaoler was
deaf to entreaty and closed the prison doors upon the pair and
the Shalabi and his spouse sat down together and his heart was
satisfied and his secret was safe-directed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7562" id="noteref-7562" epub:type="noteref">7562</a> and fell from him all
the sorrow which had settled upon his heart. Such was the case
with these two; but as regards the Chief of Police, when he went
up to the Sultan and saw that he was busied he took patience
until the work was ended, after which he came forward and kissed
ground before him and salam’d to him and blessed him. The
King returned his salute and then said, “What is to do?” and
said he, “O King of the Age, I found during the past night the
Lady Sitt al-Husn, daughter to the Kazi al-’Askar, companying
with her lover a certain Mohammed Shalabi son of the Emir
Such-and-such; so I seized the couple and confined them by me
and now I myself come to report the case in thy presence.” When
the Sultan heard these words, he was wroth with exceeding wrath
and his eyes flashed red and his outer jugulars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7563" id="noteref-7563" epub:type="noteref">7563</a> swelled and he
foamed at the mouth and roaring cried, “How can it be that the
daughter of the Kazi al-Islam companieth with a lover and
alloweth herself to be debauched? By Allah, needs must I slay
her and slay her father and slay the youth her lover.” Thus befel
it with the Sultan and the Wali; but as regards the matter of the
girl Sitt al-Husn, when she went forth the prison in the dress of a
Shalabi, a dainty youth, she ceased not wending till she reached
her paternal home. Here she repaired to a place which was
private and having doffed her man’s dress garbed her in maidenly
garments, then retiring secretly to her own room lay her down
and her heart was heartened and trouble and turmoil and travail
of mind fell from her. Now at that time her mother was lamenting
like a funeral mourner and buffeting her face and her breast
and kept crying out, “Oh the shame of us! Oh the dishonour of
us! When they shall have informed the Sultan of this, he
shall surely slay her sire.” And the Kazi waxed distraught
and full of thought and he also said in his mind, “How shall I
remain Kazi al-Islam when the folk of Cairo say:—Verily the
daughter of our Lord High Chancellor hath been debauched?”
With these words he kept visiting his wife’s apartment and sitting
with her for awhile, then faring forth and coming in from place to
place<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7564" id="noteref-7564" epub:type="noteref">7564</a> and he wandered about like one bewildered of wits. When
behold, a handmaid of the handmaidens entered the room wherein
lay the Kazi’s daughter and finding her strown upon her bed
looked upon her and recognised her. So she left her and running
in her haste hied her to the mistress and cried, “O my lady, indeed
Sitt al-Husn of whom you are talking is lying down in such a
room of the Harem.” Thereupon the mother arose and went
and came upon her daughter, so she rejoiced in her and returning
to the Kazi in his apartment acquainted him therewith. He also
repaired to his daughter’s bower and finding her therein quoth he,
“Where hast thou been?” Quoth she, “O my father, my head
began to ache after sunset-time, so I lay me down in this place.”
Hereupon without stay or delay the Kazi took horse, he and his
Officials, and repaired to the Sultan——And Shahrazad was
surprised by the dawn of day and fell silent and ceased to say
her permitted say. Then quoth her sister, Dunyazad, “How
sweet is thy story, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!”
Quoth she, “And where is this compared with that I
would relate to you on the coming night an the King suffer
me to survive?” Now when it was the next night and that was</p>

<p>Dunyazad said to her, “Allah upon thee, O my sister, an thou
be other than sleepy, finish for us thy tale that we may cut short
the watching of this our latter night!” She replied:——With
love and goodwill! It hath reached me, O auspicious King, the
director, the right-guiding, lord of the rede which is benefiting and
of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that the Kazi of
the Army repaired to the Sultan, he and the whole of his officials,
and he ceased not wending until he entered the presence, where
he salam’d and said, “O King of the Age, is it lawful and allowed
of Allah Almighty that thy Wali charge us with calumnious charge
and false?” As the Chief of Police was standing hard by, the
Sultan asked him, “How can the Wali have misspoken thee and
thy daughter when she is still imprisoned by him and in his
house?” whereto the Chief of Police added, “’Tis true! his daughter
is surely with us in durance vile, she along with her lover, for
indeed I found the pair in such a place.” Said the Kazi, “O
King of the Age, I will abide here beside thee and do thou let
the Wali go down and bring before thee that which is with him in
gaol, and the case shall be made manifest, because hearing with
the ear is not like eyeing with the eye.” The Sultan replied,
“This rede is right,” whereupon the Chief of Police returned to
his house and ordered the gaoler to open the gaol and bring
thereout the maiden Sitt al-Husn and her lover the youth
Mohammed Shalabi. The man did his bidding and leading
forth of prison the couple committed them to the Chief of Police
who took them and fared with them to the Sovran, rejoicing the
while with all joy. The citizens of Cairo heard of all this, so they
flocked in crowds to solace them with the spectacle; and when
the Wali reached the presence, the maiden and the young man
being with him, he set them before the Sultan. Presently the
King asked the youth saying, “Who mayest thou be, O young
man, and who is thy father?” and answered he, “I am son of
such an Emir;” when the King who believed that she was the
daughter of the Chief Kazi continued, “And this maiden that is
with thee, who may she be and whose daughter?” The youth
replied, “This is my wife, O King of the Age,” and the King
rejoined, “How can she be thy wife?” So the youth retorted,
“Indeed she is; and Such-an-one and So-and-so and Such-another
together with a host of thy favoured courtiers wot right well that
she is my spouse and that she is the daughter of So-and-so.”
Hereupon they accosted her and bespoke her and she bespake
them, so they recognized her and were certified that she was
lawful wife to the Shalabi. Then asked the King, “How is it
that the Wali arrested thee and her?” and the youth answered,
“O King of the Age, I went out with this my wife intending to
enjoy ourselves and, finding a place that was cheerful and pleasant
we tarried there until midnight when the Wali broke in upon us
and seized us, scandalously declaring that I was companying with
the Kazi’s daughter. Then he carried us off and gaoled us in his
house and now (Alhamdolillah!) here we are between thy hands.
So do thou whatso thou will and command according to Holy
Law and whoever shall deserve chastisement deal it to him, for
thou art the lord of our necks and the master of our good.” Now
when the youth spake these words the King bade put to death the
Chief of Police and harry his house and enslave his women and
he commanded the Crier before the execution to cry about the
thoroughfares of Cairo in front of the Wali that he was being led
to die and declare, “This is the award of him who dishonoureth
the noble and chargeth the folk with lying charges and false!”
After that they slew the Chief of Police and thus carried out the
King’s commandment.——And Shahrazad was surprised by the
dawn of day and fell silent and ceased saying her permitted say.
Then quoth her sister Dunyazad, “How sweet and tasteful is thy
tale, O sister mine, and how enjoyable and delectable!” Quoth
she, “And where is this compared with that I would relate to
you on the coming night, an the Sovran suffer me to survive?”

and of deeds fair-seeming and worthy celebrating, that after the
Wali had been put to death the Sultan bestowed his good upon
Mohammed Shalabi and having gifted him with munificent gifts
sent him home with his spouse in all honour. And when the
youth returned to his quarters he fell to kissing his wife’s hands
and feet, for that he had been saved at her hands by the stratagem
she had wrought for him and she had preserved the honour of the
Kazi’s daughter and had enabled her father to prevail over his
enemy the Wali.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7565" id="noteref-7565" epub:type="noteref">7565</a> “And now I will relate to thee” (quoth
