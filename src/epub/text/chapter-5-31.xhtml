			<h2 epub:type="title">Masrur the Eunuch and Ibn Al-Karibi</h2>

<p>The Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, was exceedingly
restless one night; so he said to his Wazir Ja’afar, “I am
sleep-less to-night and my breast is straitened and I know not
what to do.” Now his castrato Masrúr was standing before him,
and he laughed; whereupon the Caliph said “At whom laughest
thou? is it to make mock of me or hath madness seized thee?”
Answered Masrur, “Nay, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,”——And
Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say
her permitted say.</p>

<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Harun
al-Rashid said to Masrur the Sworder, “Dost thou laugh to
make mock of me or hath madness seized thee?” Answered
Masrur, “Nay, by Allah, O Commander of the Faithful, I swear
by thy kinship to the Prince of Apostles, I did it not of my free
will; but I went out yesterday to walk within sight of the palace
and, coming to the bank of the Tigris, saw there the folk
collected; so I stopped and found a man, Ibn al-Káribí hight,
who was making them laugh; but just now I recalled what he
said, and laughter got the better of me; and I crave pardon
of thee, O Commander of the Faithful!” Quoth the Caliph,
“Bring him to me forthright;” so Masrur repaired in all haste
to Ibn al-Karibi and said to him, “Answer the summons of the
Commander of the Faithful,” whereto he replied, “I hear and
obey.” “But on condition,” added Masrur, “that, if he give
thee aught, thou shalt have a quarter and the rest shall be
mine.” Replied the droll, “Nay, thou shalt have half and I
half.” Rejoined Masrur, “Not so, I will have three-quarters.”
Lastly said Ibn al-Karibi, “Thou shalt have two-thirds and I
the other third;” to which Masrur agreed, after much higgling
and haggling, and they returned to the palace together. Now
when Ibn al-Karibi came into the Caliph’s presence he saluted
him as men greet the Caliphate, and stood before him; whereupon
said Al-Rashid to him, “If thou do not make me laugh,
I will give thee three blows with this bag.” Quoth Ibn al-Karibi
in his mind, “And a small matter were blows with that bag,
seeing that beating with whips hurteth me not;” for he thought
the bag was empty. Then he began to deal out his drolleries,
such as would make the dismallest jemmy guffaw, and gave vent
to all manner of buffooneries; but the Caliph laughed not neither
smiled, whereat Ibn al-Karibi marvelled and was chagrined and
affrighted. Then said the Commander of the Faithful, “Now
hast thou earned the beating,” and gave him a blow with the
bag, wherein were four pebbles each two rotols in weight. The
blow fell on his neck and he gave a great cry, then calling to
mind his compact with Masrur, said, “Pardon, O Commander
of the Faithful! Hear two words from me.” Quoth the Caliph,
“Say on,” and quoth Ibn al-Karibi, “Masrur made it a condition
with me and I a covenant with him, that whatsoever largesse
might come to me of the bounties of the Commander of the
Faithful, one-third thereof should be mine and the rest his; nor
did he agree to leave me so much as one-third, save after much
higgling and haggling. Now thou hast bestowed on me nothing
but beating; I have had my share and here standeth he, ready
to receive his portion; so pay him the two other blows.” Now
when the Caliph heard this, he laughed till he fell on his back;
then calling Masrur, he gave him a blow, whereat he cried out
and said, “O Commander of the Faithful, the one-third sufficeth
me: give him the two-thirds.”——And Shahrazad perceived the
dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.</p>

and ordered them a thousand dinars each, and they went away,
rejoicing at the largesse. And of the tales they tell is one of</p>
